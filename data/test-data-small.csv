30811,Computational analysis of glycoside hydrolase family 1 specificities.,"Glycoside hydrolase family 1 consists of beta-glucosidases, beta-galactosidases, 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases, myrosinases, and other enzymes having similar primary and tertiary structures but diverse specificities. Among these enzymes, beta-glucosidases hydrolyze cellobiose to glucose, and therefore they are key players in any cellulose to glucose process. All family members attack beta-glycosidic bonds between a pyranosyl glycon and an aglycon, but most have little specificity for the aglycon or for the bond configuration. Furthermore, glycon specificity is not absolute. Sixteen family members (six beta-glucosidases, two cyanogenic beta-glucosidases, one 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase, two myrosinases, and five beta-glycosidases) have known tertiary structures. We have used automated docking to computationally bind disaccharides with allopyranosyl, galactopyranosyl, glucopyranosyl, mannopyranosyl, 6-phosphogalactopyranosyl, and 6-phosphoglucopyranosyl glycons, all linked by beta-(1,2), beta-(1,3), beta-(1,4), and beta-(1,6)-glycosidic bonds to beta-glucopyranoside aglycons, along with beta-(1,1-thio)-allopyranosyl, -galactopyranosyl, -glucopyranosyl, and -mannopyranosyl) beta-glucopyranosides, into all of these structures to investigate the structural determinants of their enzyme specificities. The following are the eight active-site residues: Glu191, Thr194, Phe205, Asn285, Arg336, Asn376, Trp378, and Trp465 (Zea mays beta-glucosidase numbering), that control a significant amount of glycon specificity.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Disaccharides', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Substrate Specificity']",18615662,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.820.235'], ['D09.698.629.305', 'D09.947.750'], ['D08.811.277.450'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['G02.111.835']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
23155,Induction of smoking urge through imaginal and in vivo procedures: physiological and self-report manifestations.,"This experiment assessed reactivity to imaginal and in vivo smoking and control cues. One hundred current smokers were assessed during 2 sessions separated by a 6-hr interval, and half of the participants were abstinent from smoking over this interval. Verbal and physiological reactivity measures were selected based on their relevance for several models of urge. Results indicated that imaginal and in vivo smoking cues were equally effective at eliciting high levels of self-reported urges. Smoking deprivation led to a general enhancement in urge report, rather than a specific increase to smoking cues. Physiological responding differed somewhat as a function of urge induction method, although autonomic responses to smoking cues were uniformly consistent with the direct effects of nicotine. There was no relationship between verbal and physiological urge indices. Implications of the findings for several contemporary models of drug urges are discussed.","['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Cues', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imagery, Psychotherapy', 'Male', 'Motivation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Smoking', 'Social Facilitation', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome']",9103714,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['F02.463.425.234'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.190.525.249', 'F04.754.462'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['F01.145.805'], ['F01.145.813.655'], ['C25.775.835', 'F03.900.825']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
8601,"Owners' view of their pets' emotions, intellect, and mutual relationship: Cats and dogs compared.","Companion animals have established special relationships with humans, as demonstrated by many studies describing their abilities and bonds to communicate with humans. In this questionnaire-based study, we explored owners' views of pets in terms of their emotional and intellectual functions and their relationship with owners, and compared the results between cat owners and dog owners. We found that although both types of owners most often regarded their pets as ""family members,"" this tendency was weaker in cat owners. Cat owners also scored significantly lower than dog owners for some emotions and intellect they thought their pets might have. Additionally, cat owners who regard their cats as family members tend to attribute ""compassion"" to their cats more strongly than cat owners who regard their pets as non-family. This study revealed that some aspects of cat owners' views of their pets differ from those of dog owners. These finding may help us to better understand our heterospecific companions and establish good relationships with them.","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Cats', 'Cognition', 'Dogs', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Human-Animal Bond', 'Humans', 'Intelligence', 'Male', 'Pets', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",28267573,"[['B01.050'], ['F01.145.113'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.377.750.250.125'], ['F02.463.188'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['F01.470'], ['F01.145.496.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.543'], ['B01.050.050.116.600'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
23380,Esophageal cancer as second primary tumor after breast cancer radiotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: An increased risk of esophageal cancer has been reported in survivors of breast cancer treated with radiotherapy. This study further characterizes this association.METHODS: Through hospital databases, 118 patients (109 men, 9 women) treated for esophageal cancer between 1985 and 1993 were identified, of whom 37 had 60 synchronous or metachronous cancers. 5 women had primary esophageal cancer after having breast cancer, and are the subjects of this case-control study.RESULTS: All 5 women had been treated with radical mastectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy; none received chemotherapy. Their ages at the time of breast cancer ranged from 36 to 82 years; at esophageal cancer, 61 to 95 years. Time between radiotherapy and esophageal cancer varied from 13 to 31 years. All esophageal cancers were squamous cell carcinomas. Mean survival after esophageal cancer was 14.2 months.CONCLUSIONS: Radio-induced esophageal cancer can occur as a second primary cancer in women who survive at least 1 decade after mastectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary']",11754854,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['C04.588.180.260', 'C17.800.090.500.260'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['C04.588.274.476.205', 'C04.588.443.353', 'C06.301.371.205', 'C06.405.117.430', 'C06.405.249.205'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.682', 'C26.733.476', 'G01.750.748.500.476'], ['C04.692']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
22359,Effects of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine on rat myometrium.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine on the contractility of isolated uterine muscle strips from pregnant and non-pregnant female rats.METHODS: Full-thick myometrial strips were prepared from 18- to 21-day pregnant (n=8) and non-pregnant rats (n=7). After contractions became regular, strips were exposed to cumulative concentrations of the two drugs from 10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L, amplitude and frequency of the uterine contraction was recorded.RESULTS: Two local anesthetics caused a concentration dependent inhibition on contractility of myometrial strips from pregnant and non-pregnant rats. In the myometrium from non-pregnant rats, -logIC(50) of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine were 4.85 and 4.25 respectively. In the myometrium from pregnant rats, similar concentrations of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine were observed, -logIC(50) were 2.7 and 2.9 respectively. Levobupivacaine produced an increase in amplitude of contractions, while bupivacaine showed an increased trend in frequency.CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that levobupivacaine and bupivacaine may inhibit myometrium contractility. The inhibitory effect of levobupivacaine or bupivacaine is not enhanced by gestation in rat. Levobupivacaine may have more positive influence than bupivacaine in pregnant myometrium.","['Anesthetics, Local', 'Animals', 'Bupivacaine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Levobupivacaine', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Uterine Contraction']",16909479,"[['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.065.199.239', 'D02.092.146.113.239'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.481'], ['D02.065.199.239.500', 'D02.092.146.113.239.500'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['G08.686.784.769.326.700', 'G11.427.494.890']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
31262,Down-regulation and differential restoration of cAMP responses upon transient phorbol ester treatment of primary osteoblastic cells.,"We studied cAMP responses induced by parathyroid hormone (PTH), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and forskolin in foetal rat calvariae-derived osteoblastic cells after 24 h treatment with a protein kinase C (PKC) activating phorbol ester. After this treatment, meant to down-regulate PKC activity, all tested cAMP responses were attenuated and were indeed accompanied by a decline in PKC activity. PTH receptor affinity was not altered and PTH receptor number was only slightly lowered after 24 h phorbol ester treatment. These results indicate that modulation of the cAMP responses by 24 h PMA treatment was mainly caused by a general impairment of adenylyl cyclase activity. Removal of the phorbol ester and subsequent culture for 2 days rendered the cells hyper-responsive to PTH: the PTH-induced cAMP response was 2 to 3 times higher than in control cells. Again no change in binding affinity of the PTH receptor was observed and receptor number was just 10% lower than in control cells. The PGE2- and forskolin-induced cAMP responses were not higher than normal. So, transient phorbol ester treatment leads to a differential, agonist-dependent restoration of the cAMP signalling system.","['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine', 'Adenylyl Cyclases', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Dinoprostone', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Kinetics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Phorbol Esters', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Parathyroid Hormone', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skull', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",8588978,"[['D03.633.100.759.758.824.751.500'], ['D08.811.520.650.200', 'D12.644.360.050', 'D12.776.476.050'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.251'], ['D02.455.849.291.300'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.200'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A11.329.629'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['D02.455.849.291.500.510'], ['D27.505.519.389.735'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.650', 'D12.776.543.750.750.600'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A02.835.232.781'], ['D02.455.849.291.500.510.850']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2833,Distribution of RNA editing sites in Oenothera mitochondrial mRNAs and rRNAs.,"To investigate whether RNA editing in plant mitochondria modifies structural RNAs as well as protein-coding RNAs we compared the genomic-encoded information with the respective transcripts of several genes in Oenothera. The genes analysed are the 5S, 18S and 26 S rRNAs, the alpha-subunit of ATPase (atpA), cytochrome b (cytb), orfB, which is located upstream of cytochrome oxidase subunit III, and the respective leader, trailer and spacer sequences. All open reading frames were found to be edited to some degree. The atpA coding region has the least edited mRNA in Oenothera mitochondria, with only four nucleotides altered in the 1533 nucleotide open reading frame. From this analysis we conclude that frequent RNA editing is indicative of functional protein coding regions in plant mitochondria. The extensive editing in orfB, for example, suggests that this orf codes for a mitochondrial protein. No RNA editing event was found in the 5S rRNA or in the 1824 nucleotides analysed of the 18S rRNA, but two nucleotides were found to be altered in the 1970 nucleotides compared for the 26S rRNA. One nucleotide alteration has changed C to U, the other in reverse U to C. However, only one of five cDNA clones covering this region shows the modifications, similar to many silent editing events in open reading frames. RNA editing in the structural RNAs thus does not seem to be essential for their function in the mitochondrial ribosome.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytochrome b Group', 'DNA', 'Electron Transport Complex IV', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Plants', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Mitochondrial', 'RNA, Ribosomal', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 5S']",1725505,"[['D08.811.277.040.025'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D08.244.187', 'D12.776.422.220.187'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D05.500.562.374', 'D08.811.600.250.687', 'D08.811.682.285', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.875.304', 'D12.776.543.277.687', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.875.484'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.360.335.760.640', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.650'], ['B01.650'], ['D13.444.735'], ['G02.111.760', 'G03.839', 'G05.308.700'], ['D13.444.735.580'], ['D13.444.735.686'], ['D13.444.735.686.675'], ['D13.444.735.686.650']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Sertraline strongly attenuated the rate of dissociation of [3H]nisoxetine from the noradrenaline transporter, while citalopram strongly attenuated that of [3H]citalopram from the 5-HT transporter. The effect of both drugs were stereospecific. Less potent affinity-modulating drugs were identified with regards to [3H]GBR 12935 dissociation from the dopamine transporter.

31376,Spatiotemporal Bayesian inference dipole analysis for MEG neuroimaging data.,"Recently, we described a Bayesian inference approach to the MEG/EEG inverse problem that used numerical techniques to estimate the full posterior probability distributions of likely solutions upon which all inferences were based [Schmidt, D.M., George, J.S., Wood, C.C., 1999. Bayesian inference applied to the electromagnetic inverse problem. Human Brain Mapping 7, 195; Schmidt, D.M., George, J.S., Ranken, D.M., Wood, C.C., 2001. Spatial-temporal bayesian inference for MEG/EEG. In: Nenonen, J., Ilmoniemi, R. J., Katila, T. (Eds.), Biomag 2000: 12th International Conference on Biomagnetism. Espoo, Norway, p. 671]. Schmidt et al. (1999) focused on the analysis of data at a single point in time employing an extended region source model. They subsequently extended their work to a spatiotemporal Bayesian inference analysis of the full spatiotemporal MEG/EEG data set. Here, we formulate spatiotemporal Bayesian inference analysis using a multi-dipole model of neural activity. This approach is faster than the extended region model, does not require use of the subject's anatomical information, does not require prior determination of the number of dipoles, and yields quantitative probabilistic inferences. In addition, we have incorporated the ability to handle much more complex and realistic estimates of the background noise, which may be represented as a sum of Kronecker products of temporal and spatial noise covariance components. This reduces the effects of undermodeling noise. In order to reduce the rigidity of the multi-dipole formulation which commonly causes problems due to multiple local minima, we treat the given covariance of the background as uncertain and marginalize over it in the analysis. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was used to sample the many possible likely solutions.

13575,An alpha modulation index for electroencephalographic studies using complex demodulation.,"An automated technique for measuring the relative amount of amplitude modulation of electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha activity is developed to increase the number of existing tools for differentiating the various types of alpha activity. EEG data collected from 12 normal males is used to characterize alpha modulation frequency characteristics. From these findings, a complex demodulation method is constructed to extract the amplitude modulation envelope of alpha activity from an epoch of EEG data while disregarding both continuous amplitude alpha activity and activity outside the alpha band. A threshold technique is then used to determine the relative amount of modulation contained within the data epoch. This metric is termed the alpha modulation index (AMI). Good correlation (R2 = 0.86) is found when automated scoring results are compared with manual scoring of physiologic EEG alpha modulation. The flexibility of this technique makes it easily adaptable to other EEG frequency bands and applications.","['Electroencephalography', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted']",10912347,"[['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
37203,[Patient information and obtaining informed consent in laparoscopic surgery].,"Since the advent of laparoscopic surgery, the number of suits against surgeons has risen. One of the most frequent complaints is the lack of sufficient information. Physicians in France have a formal obligation to provide information in the contractual legal context established since 1936. This notion has been confirmed in several court cases. The requirement for patient informed consent has been confirmed by several decisions of the Appeals Court and is stated in the code of deontology. The value of classical oral information has been recently questioned in certain court cases. We analyse the current legal situation in France and try to define the content of information required in the case of laparoscopic surgery in addition to the way this information is provided and the means of obtaining informed consent. The information provided must be personalised. The patient must informed that laparoscopy remains a surgical operation. It is licit to warn the patient of predictable risks according to statistical probabilities, of the team's experience and of the patients own status including past history and psychological factors. A written statement may be prepared but must remain a document complementary to personalised oral information. The surgeon must obtain and assure good patient comprehension. The surgical community should publish risk rates in order for surgeons to have reliable references which can be used to define the notion of exceptional risk.","['Cognition', 'Forecasting', 'France', 'Freedom', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Laparoscopy', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Probability', 'Risk Factors', 'Writing']",9773003,"[['F02.463.188'], ['I01.320'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['I01.880.604.473.380', 'N03.706.437.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.880.604.473.650.718', 'I01.880.604.583.427', 'N03.706.437.650.312', 'N03.706.535.489'], ['E01.370.388.250.520', 'E04.502.250.520'], ['I02.233.332.500', 'N02.421.726.407.680'], ['F01.829.401.650.675', 'N05.300.660.625'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['L01.559.423.906']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1
25988,Enhanced glomerular prostaglandin formation in experimental membranous nephropathy.,"To determine whether the induction of immune-mediated glomerular injury influences the formation of cyclooxygenase products by glomerular cells, we determined prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) (as the stable metabolite of TXA2) formation in isolated glomeruli of rats with passive Heymann nephritis (PHN). PHN is a model of membranous nephropathy mediated by antibody and complement independent of inflammatory cells. Five days following induction of PHN by injection of heterologous antibody to rat proximal tubular brush border antigen (Fx1A) rats developed proteinuria 36.5 +/- 34 (controls 3.8 +/- 1 mg/day). Treatment with cobra venom factor, which depleted complement C3 levels to less than 10% of baseline, prevented the development of proteinuria (6.9 +/- 2 mg/day). The development of subepithelial, glomerular immune-complex deposits and proteinuria was associated with a significant stimulation of glomerular PGE2 (87%) and TXB2 (183%) formation. This increment in glomerular prostanoid biosynthesis was significantly inhibited (PGE2 increased 22%, TXB2 increased 75%) in animals that were complement depleted with cobra venom factor. Cobra venom factor had no effect on glomerular prostanoid formation in normal rats. In additional experiments we tested the hypothesis that TXA2 may contribute to mediation of proteinuria in PHN. We utilized a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor UK38485. UK38485 reduced glomerular TXB2 formation by 80% without influencing glomerular deposition of 125I-labeled antibody, and did not alter levels of urine protein excretion in rats with PHN (control 42 +/- 21, UK 38485, 39 +/- 24 mg/day, P greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Animals', 'Complement C3', 'Dinoprostone', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Imidazoles', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Male', 'Prostaglandins', 'Prostaglandins E', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Thromboxane B2']",3474470,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.050.140', 'D12.776.124.486.274.250'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.200'], ['C12.777.419.570.363', 'C13.351.968.419.570.363'], ['D03.383.129.308'], ['A05.810.453.324.359', 'A05.810.453.736.520'], ['D10.251.355.255.550', 'D23.469.050.175.725'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.825.810', 'D10.251.355.310.166.971.810']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27856,Increase in caudate nuclei volumes of first-episode schizophrenic patients taking antipsychotic drugs.,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the pathomorphology of the caudate nuclei in first-episode schizophrenic patients with minimal previous neuroleptic exposure.METHOD: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was used to examine longitudinally the caudate pathomorphology in 29 first-episode schizophrenic patients and 10 healthy comparison subjects. MRI scans were obtained after the subjects entered the study and at 18-month follow-up. The patients were treated with standardized neuroleptic regimens during the 18-month period. Volumetric assessments of the cerebral cortex, lateral ventricles, and caudate nuclei were performed on T1-weighted coronal brain sections. In addition, the patients were systematically evaluated for psychopathology at baseline and during treatment.RESULTS: Caudate volumes increased 5.7% in the patients during the 18-month treatment interval, whereas they decreased 1.6% in the comparison subjects over the same time period. Greater amounts of antipsychotic medication received by patients before the first scan and younger age at the time of the first scan were associated with larger increases in caudate volume.CONCLUSIONS: Caudate enlargement occurs early in the course of treatment in young first-episode schizophrenic patients. This may be a result of an interaction between neuroleptic treatment and the plasticity of dopaminergic neuronal systems in young patients.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Caudate Nucleus', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Cerebral Ventricles', 'Dopamine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology']",7916539,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['D27.505.696.277.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.210.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.700.872.331'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487.550.184'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['A08.186.211.140'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['G11.561.638'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['F03.700.750'], ['F04.824']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

29631,Renal angiomyolipoma: selective arterial embolization--effectiveness and changes in angiomyogenic components in long-term follow-up.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of selective arterial embolization in symptomatic renal angiomyolipoma (AML) and the change in angiomyogenic components during long-term follow-up after embolization.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen adult patients with symptomatic AMLs underwent 16 selective arterial embolizations. The embolic materials used were absolute alcohol with (n = 5) or without (n = 3) iodized oil, Gianturco coils (n = 4), and polyvinyl alcohol foam powder with gelatin sponge (n = 2). Follow-up ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) were performed in six and 14 patients, respectively. The effectiveness of selective arterial embolization was evaluated on the basis of the area of the angiomyogenic components in the AML on initial and follow-up images and clinical improvement.RESULTS: All patients showed devascularization of the tumor on the postembolization angiograms. In 13 patients, clinical symptoms disappeared. The follow-up period was 7-72 months (mean, 33 months). One patient underwent nephrectomy at 7 months after embolization because of a large cystic lesion found at 1 month. In long-term CT follow-up (> or =12 months) in 12 patients, nearly all angiomyogenic components disappeared, but fatty components partially shrank with liquefactive necrosis in tumors.CONCLUSION: Selective arterial embolization is an effective and safe treatment of AML. The angiomyomatous components crucial for the prevention of bleeding were very sensitive to the embolization.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiomyolipoma', 'Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gelatin Sponge, Absorbable', 'Hemostatics', 'Humans', 'Iodized Oil', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyvinyls', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",9205224,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.450.550.125', 'C04.557.450.692.249'], ['E02.520.360', 'E02.926.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['E07.858.740.300'], ['D27.505.954.502.270.463'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D10.627.700.550', 'D20.215.784.750.550'], ['C04.588.945.947.535', 'C12.758.820.750', 'C12.777.419.473', 'C13.351.937.820.535', 'C13.351.968.419.473'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.616', 'D02.455.326.271.884.533', 'D05.750.716.721', 'D25.720.716.721', 'J01.637.051.720.716.721'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

Cytochromes P-450 and P-420 were also present. The cytochrome b5 content of microsomal preparations from a number of oilseed species was found to be in the order of 200-300 pmol/mg of protein. The cytochrome b5 was reduced in the membrane preparations by NADH, demonstrating the presence of an NADH: cytochrome b5 reductase; NADPH was a less effective donor. Microsomal membranes catalysed the NAD(P)H-dependent conversion of radioactive oleate into linoleate, indicating acyl-CoA: lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase and 1-acyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine delta 12-desaturase (delta 12-desaturase) activity. Desaturation of oleate to linoleate was unaffected by CO, but inhibited by CN-. The addition of oleoyl-CoA to the NADH-reduced membranes resulted in the CN(-)-sensitive partial re-oxidation of cytochrome b5, indicating that electrons from NADH were transferred to the site of desaturation via this cytochrome. The delta 12-desaturase in safflower, therefore, is CN(-)-sensitive and appears to require cytochrome b5 and NADH: cytochrome b5 reductase for activity.","['Cytochromes b5', 'Electron Transport', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases', 'Kinetics', 'Microsomes', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plants', 'Spectrophotometry']",2264826,"[['D08.244.187.500', 'D12.776.422.220.187.500'], ['G02.111.248', 'G03.295.531.403', 'G03.493.350'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.392'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A11.284.835.540'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['B01.650'], ['E05.196.712.726', 'E05.196.867.826']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
49663,Cytology and immunocytochemistry of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.,"A study of the value of cytologic examination in the diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma showed that fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is a definitive means of making the diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. In experienced hands, FNA cytology approached a diagnostic accuracy of 100%. With exfoliative cytology, technically adequate sputum samples offered an 82% diagnostic yield; sputum cytology should thus be considered as an adjunct method in establishing the diagnosis. Several cytologic features that strongly suggest the diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and help to differentiate it from adenocarcinomas of other body sites are outlined. It is also concluded that immunocytochemical stains have limited value in differentiating bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and other types of clear cell malignant neoplasms, including mesothelioma, unless a panel of antibodies is used, and are of no value in ascertaining whether the cells are benign or malignant.","['Adenocarcinoma, Bronchiolo-Alveolar', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Body Fluids', 'Bronchi', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Sputum', 'Therapeutic Irrigation']",2827409,"[['C04.557.470.200.025.022.500', 'C04.588.894.797.520.055.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.119', 'E01.370.225.998.054.119', 'E01.370.388.100.100', 'E04.074.119', 'E04.665.100', 'E05.200.500.384.100.119', 'E05.200.998.054.119', 'E05.242.384.100.119'], ['A12.207'], ['A04.411.125'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['A12.200.808'], ['E02.779.492.500', 'E02.831.535.492.500', 'E05.927']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
34938,Motivation deficits and use of alcohol and illicit drugs among individuals with schizophrenia.,"This study examined the impact of substance use on intrinsic motivation and evaluated the association between intrinsic motivation and substance use recovery among individuals with schizophrenia. Alcohol and illicit drug use and intrinsic motivation were evaluated at baseline and 6-months for 1434 individuals with schizophrenia from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) using self-rated substance use assessments and a derived motivation measure from the Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale. Results revealed patients had moderate motivation deficits overall and a considerable number were using alcohol or illicit drugs at baseline (n=576; 40.2%). Regression models at baseline showed patients with low levels of motivation had higher odds of substance use and those who were using substances had greater motivation deficits. At 6-months, substance using patients continued to demonstrate greater motivation deficits; however, those with high levels of motivation exhibited a greater reduction in their use of substances. Findings remained significant after adjusting for clinical confounds and were consistent across any substance, alcohol, and cannabis use. Our results emphasize concerns about substance use compounding motivation deficits in schizophrenia, and suggest that disentangling the motivation-substance use relationship in schizophrenia may facilitate efforts aimed at ameliorating these challenges and improving outcomes.","['Adult', 'Alcohol-Related Disorders', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology', 'Substance-Related Disorders']",28441618,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C25.775.100', 'F03.900.100'], ['F03.615.250.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['F03.700.750'], ['F04.824'], ['C25.775', 'F03.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
40505,Percutaneous treatment of lumbar intervertebral disk hernias with radiopaque gelified ethanol: a preliminary study.,"STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of gelified ethanol in the percutaneous treatment of lumbar disk hernias.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: After the commercial withdrawal of Chymopapain, the need for new substances to treat intervertebral disk hernias was evident. Good results were obtained with pure ethanol, but this substance was difficult to handle. We decided to use a similar substance mixed with ethylcellulose to increase its viscosity and enhanced with radiopaque material.METHODS: Two hundred seventy-six consecutive patients sent to be treated of a lumbar intervertebral disk hernia percutaneously were included in this preliminary study and treated with radiopaque gelified ethanol (RGE) and intra-articular steroids. Three groups were set, group A for patients to be treated only with RGE and groups B and C for difficult cases presenting a narrow canal, foraminal hernia, or hiperalgic sleepless hernia, treated with RGE plus another intradiscal technique, automatized percutaneous diskectomy for group B and radiofrequency nucleoplasty for group C.RESULTS: Very good or good results were obtained in 202 (91.4%) of the 221 patients in group A. Of the 44 patients in group B, 37 patients (84%) presented very good or good results and in 9 (82%) of the 11 patients of group C, we obtained similar results. There was no allergic complication in any of our patients. Short-term follow-up with magnetic resonance showed little or no changes in the intervertebral disk but there was discordance with clinical signs. Long-term follow-up magnetic resonance showed a dramatic reduction in hernia volume.CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows the efficacy and inocuity of this new substance that could take over the Chymopapain therapeutic field.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cellulose', 'Contrast Media', 'Diskectomy, Percutaneous', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Intervertebral Disc Chemolysis', 'Intervertebral Disc Displacement', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sclerosing Solutions', 'Treatment Outcome']",17912130,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D05.750.078.562.180', 'D09.698.365.180', 'D25.720.099.500', 'J01.637.051.720.099.500'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['E02.718.444.200', 'E04.188.350.200', 'E04.555.200.200'], ['D02.033.375'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.718.500'], ['C05.116.900.307', 'C23.300.707.952'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D26.776.708.822', 'D27.505.954.411.700', 'D27.505.954.578.822', 'D27.720.752.822'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

22928,Effect of fluvoxamine augmentation and smoking on clozapine serum concentrations.,"BACKGROUND: Clozapine (CLZ) is metabolized via cytochrome P450 CYP1A2 to N-desmethylclozapine (NCLZ). Smoking induces CYP1A2 thereby increasing clozapine metabolism whereas fluvoxamine inhibits CYP1A2. Studies suggest that the beneficial effect of fluvoxamine augmentation in raising serum clozapine concentrations also occurs when serum concentrations are low due to smoking. Yet, little is known about the influence of fluvoxamine augmentation on clozapine serum concentrations in smoking versus non-smoking patients.METHODS: A TDM database was analyzed. Serum concentrations of CLZ, NCLZ, dose-adjusted serum concentrations (C/D) and metabolite-to-parent ratios (MPR) were compared using non-parametrical tests in four groups: clozapine-monotherapy in non-smokers (VNS, n = 28) and smokers (VS, n = 43); combined treatment with clozapine and fluvoxamine in non-smokers (VNS+F, n = 11) and smokers (VS+F, n = 43).RESULTS: The CLZ monotherapy smoking group showed lower values of C/D CLZ of -38.6% (p < 0.001), C/D NCLZ -35.6% (p < 0.001) and a higher MPR (p = 0.021) than in the non-smoking group. The combination of CLZ and fluvoxamine in non-smoking patients led to higher C/D values: C/D CLZ +117.9% (p < 0.001), C/D NCLZ +60.8% (p = 0.029) while the MPR did not differ between groups (p = 0.089). Changes were comparable to fluvoxamine augmentation in the smoking group with increased C/D CLZ of +120.1% (p < 0.001), C/D NCLZ of +85.8% (p < 0.001) and lower MPR (p = 0.006).CONCLUSIONS: Smoking in clozapine monotherapy reduced median dose-adjusted serum concentrations more than a third. Combined treatment with fluvoxamine and clozapine led to higher median C/D values in both, smokers and non-smokers. The opposing effects of CYP1A2 induction by smoking and inhibition by fluvoxamine on clozapine serum concentrations balanced out.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Cigarette Smoking', 'Clozapine', 'Comorbidity', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fluvoxamine', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Schizophrenia', 'Young Adult']",31182321,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.696.277.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.210.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.700.872.331'], ['F01.145.805.375.750', 'F01.145.958.875.750'], ['D03.633.300.240.220'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['D27.505.389.500.120', 'D27.505.519.389.335.120'], ['G07.690.773.968.477'], ['E02.319.310'], ['D02.092.570.665.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F03.700.750'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

49601,Antimicrobial activity of human á-defensin 5 and its linear analogs: N-terminal fatty acylation results in enhanced antimicrobial activity of the linear analogs.,"Human á-defensin 5 (HD5) exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and plays an important role in mucosal immunity of the small intestine. Although there have been several studies, the structural requirements for activity and mechanism of bacterial killing is yet to be established unequivocally. In this study, we have investigated the antimicrobial activity of HD5 and linear analogs. Cysteine deletions attenuated the antibacterial activity considerably. Candidacidal activity was affected to a lesser extent. Fatty acid conjugated linear analogs showed antimicrobial activity comparable activity to HD5. Effective surface charge neutralization of bacteria was observed for HD5 as compared to the non-fatty acylated linear analogs. Our results show that HD5 and non-fatty acylated linear analogs enter the bacterial cytoplasm without causing damage to the bacterial inner membrane. Although fatty acylated peptides exhibited antimicrobial activity comparable to HD5, their mechanism of action involved permeabilization of the Escherichia coli inner membrane. HD5 and analogs had the ability to bind plasmid DNA. HD5 had greater binding affinity to plasmid DNA as compared to the analogs. The three dimensional structure of HD5 favors greater interaction with the bacterial cell surface and also with DNA. Antibacterial activity of HD5 involves entry into bacterial cytoplasm and binding to DNA which would result in shut down of the bacterial metabolism leading to cell death. We show how a moderately active linear peptide derived from the á-defensin HD5 can be engineered to enhance antimicrobial activity almost comparable to the native peptide.","['Acylation', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Escherichia coli', 'Humans', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'alpha-Defensins']",26206286,"[['G02.111.012', 'G02.607.063', 'G03.040'], ['D27.505.954.122'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.600'], ['D12.644.050.200.050', 'D12.776.543.695.054.200.050']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9821,Interoceptive accuracy predicts nonplanning trait impulsivity.,"Influential theories concerning personality argue that many impulsive individuals show physiological underarousal at rest. This interoceptive state is proposed to be egodystonic, motivating impulsive maladaptive actions to enhance arousal. However, there is little empirical research on this matter. The current study tested the relationship between physiological markers of arousal, measures of interoceptive (in)sensitivity, and trait impulsivity in a nonclinical sample of young adults. Experiment 1 investigated whether individuals (N = 31) with high trait impulsivity show decreased resting measures of arousal (indexed from heart rate, heart rate variability, and sympathetic electrodermal activity). Experiment 2 assessed whether trait impulsivity is linked to interoceptive abilities (N = 60). Overall, our results do not provide any compelling support for the underarousal theory of impulsivity. However, impaired interoceptive (cardiac discrimination) accuracy predicted the degree of Barratt nonplanning impulsivity, such that individuals with a better ability to distinguish between internal (bodily) and external signals manifest lower levels of nonplanning trait impulsivity. These findings open an avenue for potential novel interventions aimed at improving planning abilities via better interoceptive discrimination.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arousal', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Interoception', 'Male', 'Personality', 'Young Adult']",30702155,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F02.830.104', 'G11.561.035'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E05.796.332', 'F02.830.702.315', 'F04.669.332', 'G07.265.563', 'G13.750.415'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.527'], ['F02.463.593.465'], ['F01.752'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

32624,Cloning and characterization of a galactitol 2-dehydrogenase from Rhizobium legumenosarum and its application in D-tagatose production.,"Galactitol 2-dehydrogenase (GDH) belongs to the protein subfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases and can be used to produce optically pure building blocks and for the bioconversion of bioactive compounds. An NAD(+)-dependent GDH from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841 (RlGDH) was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The RlGDH protein was purified as an active soluble form using His-tag affinity chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 28kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 114kDa by gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that the enzyme is a homotetramer. The enzyme has an optimal pH and temperature of 9.5 and 35°C, respectively. The purified recombinant RlGDH catalyzed the oxidation of a wide range of substrates, including polyvalent aliphatic alcohols and polyols, to the corresponding ketones and ketoses. Among various polyols, galactitol was the preferred substrate of RlGDH with a Km of 8.8mM, kcat of 835min(-1) and a kcat/Km of 94.9min(-1)mM(-1). Although GDHs have been characterized from a few other sources, RlGDH is distinguished from other GDHs by its higher specific activity for galactitol and broad substrate spectrum, making RlGDH a good choice for practical applications.","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Escherichia coli', 'Galactitol', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Rhizobium leguminosarum', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases']",24731824,"[['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500', 'G02.111.570.820.709.600.500'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D12.776.097'], ['G02.130'], ['E05.196.181.400.170'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['E05.393.220'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D02.033.800.400', 'D09.853.400'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.364.249', 'G05.360.340.358.024.249', 'G05.360.340.358.207.249'], ['G02.300'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.494'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['B03.440.400.425.700.800.450', 'B03.585.900.450', 'B03.660.050.662.670.450'], ['E05.393.751'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200'], ['G02.111.835'], ['D08.811.682.047.150.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
44251,PKD controls ávâ3 integrin recycling and tumor cell invasive migration through its substrate Rabaptin-5.,"Integrin recycling is critical for cell migration. Protein kinase D (PKD) mediates signals from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) to control ávâ3 integrin recycling. We now show that Rabaptin-5, a Rab5 effector in endosomal membrane fusion, is a PKD substrate. PKD phosphorylates Rabaptin-5 at Ser407, and this is both necessary and sufficient for PDGF-dependent short-loop recycling of ávâ3, which in turn inhibits á5â1 integrin recycling. Rab4, but not Rab5, interacts with phosphorylated Rabaptin-5 toward the front of migrating cells to promote delivery of ávâ3 to the leading edge, thereby driving persistent cell motility and invasion that is dependent on this integrin. Consistently, disruption of Rabaptin-5 Ser407 phosphorylation reduces persistent cell migration in 2D and ávâ3-dependent invasion. Conversely, invasive migration that is dependent on á5â1 integrin is promoted by disrupting Rabaptin phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that the PKD pathway couples receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to an integrin switch via Rabaptin-5 phosphorylation.","['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaVbeta3', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins']",22975325,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['A11.251'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.395.550.625.439', 'D12.776.543.550.625.439', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.460.870.500', 'D12.776.543.750.705.675.541'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A11.251.210.100.550', 'A11.329.228.100.550'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['D12.776.543.990']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1548,Insulin-like growth factor 2 and short-range stimulatory loops in control of human placental growth.,"Substructures of the first-trimester human placenta (within 3 months post-conception) display 'pseudo-malignant' properties. We show here, by in situ hybridization, that the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) gene expression is particularly active in the cytotrophoblasts, which dominate these structures. Because the majority of placental IGF-2 mRNA is polysomal in extracts of first-trimester placenta, the spatial pattern of IGF-2 transcripts generally also defines the pattern of IGF-2 production. In primary trophoblast cultures, rendered quiescent by serum starvation. IGF-2 performs as a human embryonic growth factor by activating cell cycle entry/progression. Although both type 1 and 2 IGF receptor mRNAs can be found co-distributed with IGF-2 mRNA during placental development (supporting an autocrine role for IGF-2), these occasional patterns are confined to cytotrophoblasts with low proliferative potential. The reciprocity in ligand and receptor expression patterns are discussed in terms of rate-limiting steps in the involvement of IGF-2 in the proliferative phenotype of the early human placenta.","['Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Placenta', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Somatomedin', 'Somatomedins', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2551671,"[['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251'], ['G05.308'], ['G05.360.340.024.340'], ['G07.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.937.420', 'D12.776.124.862.425', 'D12.776.467.937.420', 'D23.529.937.420'], ['E05.393.661', 'G02.111.611'], ['A16.710'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.750.400.780'], ['D12.644.276.937', 'D12.776.124.862', 'D12.776.467.937', 'D23.529.937'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The maximum relaxation response to ACh, an endothelium-dependent vasodilation, was lower in aortas from old rats. Sensitivity (mean effective concentration; EC50) of ACh in old rats was significantly less than in young rats. There were no differences in maximum NOC-18-induced relaxation, an endothelium-independent vasodilation, in aortas from young and old rats. On the other hand, the concentration-response curve for NOC-18 was shifted to the right and the sensitivity (EC50 to NOC-18) was lower in old rats.

Analysis of this model without assuming any parametric distribution for the model error is challenging, and the model complexity is enhanced in the presence of large number of covariates. We developed a nonparametric Bayesian method for regularized estimation of the regression parameters in a flexible accelerated failure time model. The novelties of our method lie in modeling the error distribution of the accelerated failure time nonparametrically, modeling the variance as a function of the mean, and adopting a variable selection technique in modeling the mean. The proposed method allowed for identifying a set of important regression parameters, estimating survival probabilities, and constructing credible intervals of the survival probabilities. We evaluated operating characteristics of the proposed method via simulation studies. Finally, we apply our new comprehensive method to analyze the motivating breast cancer data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, and estimate the five-year survival probabilities for women included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1990 and 2000.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prognosis', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",28034170,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['E05.318.740.600.200', 'N05.715.360.750.625.150', 'N06.850.520.830.600.200'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['E05.318.740.525', 'L01.906.394.422', 'N05.715.360.750.540', 'N06.850.520.830.525'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.308.970.725', 'N04.452.859.819.725', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700.725', 'N06.850.520.308.970.725'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Two workload strategies were followed: strategy 1--increments in speed at a constant slope and strategy 2--increments in slope at constant velocity. Thus, data on cardio-respiratory and propulsion technique parameters were obtained on two identical series of 16 speed and slope combinations. Between each two identical speed and slope combinations of strategies 1 and 2, a different workload history is apparent. A four-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures on the factors ""strategy"" (workload history), ""speed,"" and ""slope"" was applied (P less than 0.05). No ""strategy"" effect was seen in the cardio-respiratory parameters (gross mechanical efficiency, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and heart rate), work/cycle, and cycle time. Thus, within the experimental set-up, workload history did not affect the parameters studied and 3-min workload periods appeared sufficiently long for experienced wheelchair users to adapt to the requirements of a given speed and slope combination. Significant effects were found on ""speed,"" ""slope,"" and their interaction in all parameters tested. Moreover, a comparison of two equal levels of power output, but different speed and slope, led to a significantly higher efficiency, cycle time, and work per cycle for the ""low speed and high slope"" combination. Push time and recovery time appeared highly dependent on speed and slope, respectively. The findings indicate that propulsion technique and cardio-respiratory parameters should not merely be studied in relation to power output, but also with respect to its constituents, speed, and slope/resistance.","['Adult', 'Disabled Persons', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Exercise Test', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Physical Exertion', 'Respiration', 'Sports', 'Wheelchairs']",2963939,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.150'], ['G03.295'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G11.427.683'], ['G09.772.705'], ['I03.450.642.845'], ['E07.796.980']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
27566,Rationale and design of the DP-TRANSFERS project: diabetes prevention-transferring findings from European research to society in Catalonia.,"BACKGROUND: Compelling evidence has been accumulated to support the effectiveness of intensive lifestyle intervention in delaying progression to Type 2 diabetes even in people identified as being at high risk determined by the Finnish diabetes risk score. The DE-PLAN-CAT project (diabetes in Europe-prevention using lifestyle, physical activity and nutritional intervention-Catalonia) evidenced that intensive lifestyle intervention was feasible and cost-effective on a short scale in real-life primary care settings, at least over 4 years. However, transferring such lifestyle interventions to society remains the major challenge of research in the field of diabetes prevention.METHODS/DESIGN: The derived DP-TRANSFERS (diabetes prevention-transferring findings from European research to society) is a large scale national programme aimed at translating a tailored lifestyle intervention to the maximum of primary care centres where feasible through a core proposal agreed with all the partners. The method is built upon a 3-step (screening, intervention and follow-up) real-life, community-wide structure on the basis of a dual intensity lifestyle intervention (basic and continuity modules) and supported by a 4-channel transfer strategy (institutional relationships, facilitators' workshops, collaborative groupware and programme WEB page). Participation will initially cover nine health departments (7 million inhabitants) through nine coordinating centres located in metropolitan (3.2 million), semi-urban (2.9 million) and rural (0.9 million) areas from which it is expected accessing 25 % of all primary care settings, equivalent to 90 associated centres (1.6-1.8 million people) with an estimate of 0.32 million participants aged 45-75 years at high risk of future development of diabetes. To ascertain sustainability, effect, satisfaction and quality of the translation programme statistical analyses will be performed from both the entire population (facilitators and participants) and a stratified representative sample obtained by collecting data from at least 920 participants.DISCUSSION: The DP-TRANSFERS will use a strategy of approach to society consistent with the impact of the disease and the fast accessibility provided by primary care settings in Catalonia. Both the widespread effect of the lifestyle intervention and the translational process itself could be assessed.","['Aged', 'Biomedical Research', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Europe', 'Geography', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Research Design', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Translational Medical Research']",27118544,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['H01.770.644.145'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['Z01.542'], ['H01.277.500'], ['I02.233.332.445', 'N02.421.726.407.579'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.458'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['E05.581.500', 'H01.770.644.728'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['H01.770.644.145.675']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

Conditioned medium (CM) from hMSC spheroids inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages from secreting proinflammatory cytokines TNFá, CXCL2, IL6, IL12p40, and IL23. CM also increased the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL10 and IL1ra by the stimulated macrophages, and augmented expression of CD206, a marker of alternatively activated M2 macrophages. The principal anti-inflammatory activity in CM had a small molecular weight, and microarray data suggested that it was prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This was confirmed by the observations that PGE2 levels were markedly elevated in hMSC spheroid-CM, and that the anti-inflammatory activity was abolished by an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a silencing RNA for COX-2, and an antibody to PGE2. The anti-inflammatory effects of the PGE2 on stimulated macrophages were mediated by the EP4 receptor. Spheroids formed by human adult dermal fibroblasts produced low levels of PGE2 and displayed negligible anti-inflammatory effects on stimulated macrophages, suggesting the features as unique to hMSCs. Moreover, production of PGE2 by hMSC spheroids was dependent on the activity of caspases and NFêB activation in the hMSCs. The results indicated that hMSCs in 3D-spheroid cultures are self-activated, in part by intracellular stress responses, to produce PGE2 that can change stimulated macrophages from a primarily proinflammatory M1 phenotype to a more anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype.","['Antibodies', 'Caspases', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cytokines', 'Dinoprostone', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'NF-kappa B', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP4 Subtype', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spheroids, Cellular']",22865689,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126', 'D12.644.360.075.405', 'D12.776.476.075.405'], ['E01.370.225.500.223', 'E05.200.500.265', 'E05.242.223', 'E05.481.500.249'], ['D27.720.470.305.250', 'E07.206.250'], ['D08.811.600.720.750'], ['D27.505.519.389.310.500', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500.500.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030.500.500', 'D27.505.954.329.030.500.500'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.200'], ['A11.329.228'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.503.280'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['G12.287.500'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['D12.776.503.311'], ['A11.329.830.500', 'A11.872.590.500'], ['D05.500.672', 'D12.776.260.600', 'D12.776.660.600', 'D12.776.930.600'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.200.700.600.400'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A11.251.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
19675,The kinase inhibitor O6-cyclohexylmethylguanine (NU2058) potentiates the cytotoxicity of cisplatin by mechanisms that are independent of its effect upon CDK2.,"O(6)-Cyclohexylmethylguanine (NU2058) was developed as an inhibitor of CDK2 and was previously shown to potentiate cisplatin cytotoxicity in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of cisplatin potentiation by NU2058. SQ20b, head and neck cancer cells were treated for 2h with NU2058 (100 microM) and then for a further 2h with cisplatin and NU2058. NU2058 increased cisplatin cytotoxicity, by clonogenic assay, with a dose modification factor (DMF) of 3.1. NU2058 increased total intracellular platinum levels 1.5-fold, and platinum-DNA adduct levels twofold. Furthermore, the cisplatin-DNA adducts formed were more toxic in the presence of NU2058. To investigate whether the effects of NU2058 on cisplatin adduct levels and toxicity were dependent on CDK2 activity, additional CDK2 inhibitors were tested. NU6230 (CDK2 IC(50) 18 microM) was equipotent to NU2058 (CDK2 IC(50) 17 microM) as a CDK2 inhibitor in cell-free and cell-based assays, yet did not potentiate cisplatin cytotoxicity. Furthermore, NU6102 was >1000-fold more potent than NU2058 as a CDK2 inhibitor (CDK2 IC(50) 5 nM) yet was no more active than NU2058 in potentiating cisplatin. NU2058 also potentiated melphalan (DMF 2.3), and monohydroxymelphalan (1.7), but not temozolomide or ionising radiation. Whilst NU2058 increased melphalan cytotoxicity, it did not increase melphalan-DNA adduct formation. These studies demonstrate that NU2058 alters the transport of cisplatin, causing more Pt-DNA adducts, as well as sensitizing cells to cisplatin- and melphalan-induced DNA damage. However, the effects of NU2058 are independent of CDK2 inhibition.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cisplatin', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'DNA Adducts', 'Drug Synergism', 'Guanine', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",19426695,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.346'], ['D01.210.375', 'D01.625.125', 'D01.710.100'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.500.750', 'D12.644.360.250.323', 'D12.776.167.200.323', 'D12.776.476.250.323'], ['D13.444.308.135', 'G05.200.104'], ['G07.690.773.968.477'], ['D03.633.100.759.758.399.454'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.519.389.755'], ['E01.370.225.500.383.910', 'E01.370.225.500.388.930', 'E05.200.500.383.910', 'E05.200.500.388.930', 'E05.242.383.910', 'E05.242.417.500', 'E05.337.550.200.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

163,One-step synthesis of methylene-bridged bis-carbazole and evaluation of its antitumor activity and G-quadruplex DNA binding property.,"Most reported carbazolyl G-quadruplex DNA (G4-DNA) ligands possess a rigid structure rather than a flexible one. The conformationally flexible ligands are paid much less attention. In this study, we report a novel class of non-rigid methylene-bridged biscarbazolyl ligand and their G4-DNA binding properties. Moreover, the antitumor activities of all these oligomers have been evaluated. The results show that this family of oligomers could be facilely synthesized via solely one step. Among them, compound 2, the bis-carbazole derivative, displays the best antitumor activity and IC50 values against HT-29, HepG2, A375 and MCF-7 cells are 0.69, 5.09, 3.15 and 3.8 ì mol/L, respectively. Although conformationally flexible, 2 is still capable of binding to as well as stabilizing G4-DNA via ð-ð stacking interaction. Moreover, 2 selectively binds to G4-DNA over duplex DNA. The current study enriches the category of carbazolyl G4-DNA ligands and paves the way for the search of more efficient G4-DNA ligands and antitumor leads.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Carbazoles', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA', 'G-Quadruplexes', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasms', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",31255989,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D03.633.100.473.144', 'D03.633.300.148'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G02.111.570.820.486.550', 'G05.360.580.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['C04'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41609,"The burden of mental ill health associated with childhood maltreatment in the UK, using The Health Improvement Network database: a population-based retrospective cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Childhood maltreatment is a global public health, human rights, and moral issue that is associated with a substantial mental health burden. We aimed to assess the association between childhood maltreatment and the development of mental ill health and the initiation of new prescriptions for mental ill health.METHODS: In this population-based, retrospective, open cohort study, we used a dataset from individuals in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. THIN database comprises UK electronic medical records taken from 787 general practices throughout the UK. We used read codes in these records to identify exposed patients (those with a read code identifying officially confirmed childhood maltreatment or a maltreatment-related concern) and up to two unexposed patients (those without such read codes) from the same general practice, who were matched by age and sex. We evaluated the risk of developing depression, anxiety, or serious mental illness (a composite mental ill health outcome) or initiation of a prescription drug used to treat mental ill health, and the odds ratio of these events at baseline, in the exposed versus unexposed patients.FINDINGS: The first possible date for cohort entry (the study start date) was Jan 1, 1995, and patients could enter the cohort until the study end date, Dec 31, 2018. During the study period, 11 831 850 patients were eligible to participate. Of these patients, we identified 217 758 (1·8%) patients with any recorded childhood maltreatment. These patients were matched to 423 410 unexposed control patients with no recorded exposure to childhood maltreatment. The exposed group were followed up for a median of 1·8 years (IQR 0·6-4·3) versus 3·2 years (1·3-6·1) in the unexposed group. During the study period, 11 665 (5·9%) new diagnoses of mental ill health were made in the exposed group, giving an incidence rate of 16·8 events per 1000 person-years versus 15 301 (3·7%) new recorded diagnoses at an incidence rate of 8·3 events per 1000 person-years in the unexposed cohort, giving an adjusted IRR of 2·14 (95% CI 2·08-2·19). 30 911 (14·8%) patients in the exposed group received a new prescription for any type of mental ill health (incidence rate 46·5 events per 1000 person-years) versus 36 390 (8·9%) patients in the unexposed group (20·5 per 1000 person-years) resulting in an adjusted IRR of 2·44 (95% CI 2·40-2·48).INTERPRETATION: Childhood maltreatment is thought to affect one in three children globally; therefore, a doubled risk of developing mental ill health among these individuals represents a substantial contribution to the mental ill health burden in the UK. It is imperative that public health approaches, including those aimed at preventing and detecting childhood maltreatment and its associated negative consequences, are implemented to prevent mental ill health.FUNDING: None.","['Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost of Illness', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United Kingdom']",31564467,"[['M01.060.406'], ['I01.198.240.856.350.250', 'I01.880.735.900.350.250'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['N03.219.151.165', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.182', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.046'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400', 'L01.470.750.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F03'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1

The venom antigenicity, procoagulant activities and neutralization using Thai C. rhodostoma Monovalent Antivenom (CRMAV) were also investigated. SDS-PAGE patterns of the venoms were relatively similar with minor variations. Proteomic analysis revealed that snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs, particularly P-I class), serine proteases (SVSPs) and snaclecs dominated the venom protein composition (68.96-81.80%), followed by L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (7.37-11.08% and 5.18-13.81%, respectively), corroborating C. rhodostoma envenoming effects (hemorrhage, consumptive coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and local tissue necrosis). Other proteins of lower abundances (2.82-9.13%) identified include cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP), phospholipase B, phosphodiesterase, nerve growth factor, 5'-nucleotidase, aminopeptidase and hyaluronidase. All four venoms exhibited strong procoagulant effects which were neutralized by CRMAV to different extents. CRMAV immunoreactivity was high toward venoms of CR-M, CR-I and CR-T but relatively low for CR-V venom. Among the venom samples from different locales, CR-V venom proteome has the smallest SVMP composition while SVSP, PLA2 and phosphodiesterase were more abundant in the venom. These variations in C. rhodostoma venom protein composition could partly explain the differences seen in immunoreactivity.

189,"[Prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in a group of pre-school and school children, living in conditions of poverty].","Iron deficiency is common during the first years of life. Yet, there is a paucity of data on scholar children. Our main objective was to estimate the prevalence of ferropenic anemia in children 3 to 12 years of age living under conditions of poverty. A total of 323 children were included, 171 attended to a day care institution (group A) and 152 were from the same community but not attended in the day care institution (group B). Hemoglobin (Hb), medium corpuscular volume (MCV) and serum ferritin (SF) were measured in all children. In those with Hb < or = 11 g/dl and/or MCV < or = 73 fl and/or SF < or = 15 microg/l, transferrin saturation (TS) and soluble transferrin receptors (sTR) were also measured. Iron deficiency was defined as SF < or = 15 mg/l and ferropenic anemia was defined as Hb < or = 11 g/dl or MCV < or = 73 fl with sTR > or = 38 mmol/l and SF < or = 10 microg/l or TS < or = 10%. There were no differences between the groups regarding age, weight, height, education, gender and housing conditions. Mean hemoglobin level was 12.6 g/dl (group A: 12.4 g/dl vs. group B: 12.7 g/dl; p=0.012), and mean SF was 45 mg/l, without significant differences between groups. Prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was 2.5% (8/323) and iron deficiency was 4.4% (14/317), without significant differences between groups. These results persisted after controlling for confounding variables. In this group of children living under conditions of poverty in Argentina, iron deficiency anemia was uncommon.

23736,Oxidative treatment characteristics of biotreated textile-dyeing wastewater and chemical agents used in a textile-dyeing process by advanced oxidation process.,"The oxidative treatment characteristics of biotreated textile-dyeing wastewater and typical chemicals such as desizing, scouring, dispersing and swelling agents used in the textile-dyeing process by advanced oxidation process were experimentally studied. The refractory organic matters remained in the effluent of biological treatment process without degradation may be suitable for the improvement of biodegradability and mineralized to CO2 by combined ozonation with and without hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, the refractory chemicals contained in the scouring agent A and swelling agent may not be mineralized and their biodegradability may not be improved by ozonation. However, the BOD/DOC ratio of scouring agent B increased from 0.3 to 0.45 after ozonation. Based on the results described above, advanced treatment process involving the ozonation without and with the addition of hydrogen peroxide, followed by biological treatment was proposed for the treatment of refractory wastewater discharged from the textile-dyeing process.","['Bioreactors', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Coloring Agents', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Oxidants', 'Oxidants, Photochemical', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Ozone', 'Textile Industry', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Water Purification']",15137417,"[['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['D27.720.233'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.424', 'D01.339.431.374.424', 'D01.650.550.750.400', 'D02.389.338.253'], ['D02'], ['D27.720.642', 'D27.888.569.540'], ['D27.720.642.631', 'D27.888.569.540.631'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D01.362.670.600'], ['J01.576.655.937'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.900.900', 'N06.850.860.510.900.900']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
17207,Design of Gaussia luciferase-based bioluminescent stem-loop probe for sensitive detection of HIV-1 nucleic acids.,"Here we describe the design of a bioluminescent stem-loop probe for the sensitive detection of HIV-1 spliced RNA. In this study, we employed Gaussia luciferase (GLuc), a bioluminescent protein that has several advantages over other bioluminescent proteins, including smaller size, higher bioluminescent intensity, and chemical and thermal stability. GLuc was chemically conjugated to the DABCYL-modified stem-loop probe (SLP) and was purified with a 2-step process to remove unconjugated GLuc and SLP. The binding of the target RNA to the loop region of the SLP results in the open conformation separating the stem part of SLP. GLuc conjugated to the stem acts as a reporter that produces light by a chemical reaction upon adding its substrate, coelenterazine in the presence of the target, while DABCYL serves as a quencher of bioluminescence in the closed conformation of SLP in the absence of the target. The optimized GLuc based-SLP assay resulted in a signal-to-background ratio of 47, which is the highest reported with bioluminescent SLPs and is significantly higher compared to traditional fluorescence-based SLPs that yield low signal to background ratio. Moreover, the assay showed an excellent selectivity against a single and double mismatched nucleic acid target, low detection limit, and ability to detect spiked HIV-1 RNA in human serum matrix.","['Animals', 'Copepoda', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Luciferases', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'RNA, Viral']",29897056,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.131.365.160'], ['B04.820.650.589.650.350.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.682.517', 'D12.776.532.510'], ['D12.776.532'], ['D13.444.735.828']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

11345,"Hematologic, biochemical, hormonal, and redox status alterations during reproductive activity in adult rams of two breeds.","BACKGROUND: Reproduction is a crucial, energy-consuming physiologic activity, which can temporarily disturb the homeostatic balance of the organism. Although rams are commonly placed in intense breeding programs on contemporary sheep farms, the clinicopathologic and redox status alterations have not been adequately studied during reproductive activity.OBJECTIVES: The objective was to investigate the clinicopathologic and redox status changes in rams during reproductive activity.METHODS: Thirty-seven (19 Chios and 18 Florina breed) adult, healthy rams were individually mated with ten estrus-synchronized ewes of the same breed. Blood samples were collected prior to mating, during mating, and postmating. CBC (Advia 120), cytologic blood smear evaluation, biochemical analyses (Flexor E, AVL 9180 Electrolyte Analyzer), and thyroxine measurements (Immulite 1000) were performed. The reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) test, the biological antioxidant potential (BAP) test, and oxidative stress index were used to assess redox status. The linear mixed effects model (statistical language R) was used for statistical analyses.RESULTS: Many, mostly breed-independent, clinicopathologic changes were detected during reproductive activity. Conversely, redox status alterations were found to be breed-dependent.CONCLUSIONS: Intense reproductive activity was related to mild, acute muscle damage in both breeds and mild oxidative stress in Florina rams, whereas Chios rams exhibited oxidative stress resistance. The observed clinicopathologic and redox status alterations were generally consistent with those reported during various forms of physical activity and exercise in animals and humans. Intense reproductive activity does not seem to be physiologically innocuous; however, it appears to be a relatively mild muscle-damaging physical activity.","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Breeding', 'Male', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reproduction', 'Sheep', 'Species Specificity', 'Thyroxine']",31062434,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107', 'E01.370.225.625.107', 'E05.200.500.195.107', 'E05.200.625.107', 'E05.242.195.107', 'G04.140.107', 'G09.188.105'], ['E05.820.150', 'G05.090'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['G08.686.784'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['G16.824'], ['D06.472.931.812', 'D12.125.072.050.767']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

41168,Ly49Q defines 2 pDC subsets in mice.,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play an important primary role for antiviral innate immunity by rapidly producing large amounts of type 1 interferon (IFN) upon viral infection. To study pDC biology, we generated a monoclonal antibody, termed 2E6, that recognizes pDCs. Molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding the 2E6 antigen revealed that it is a type II C-type lectin, Ly49Q, that consists of 247 amino acids with high homology to the natural killer (NK) receptor family Ly49, with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in the cytoplasmic domain. Ly49Q is expressed on pDCs but not on NK cells or myeloid dendritic cells. B220+, CD11c+, CD11b- pDCs in bone marrow were divided into Ly49Q+ and Ly49Q- subsets. While both subsets produced IFN-alpha upon cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) and herpes simplex virus stimulation, Ly49Q- pDCs responded poorly to influenza virus. In addition, Ly49Q- pDCs produced inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) upon stimulation at lower levels than those produced by Ly49Q+ pDCs. In contrast to bone marrow, Ly49Q+ pDCs were only found in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and spleen. These results indicate that Ly49Q is a specific marker for peripheral pDCs and that expression of Ly49Q defines 2 subsets of pDCs in bone marrow.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Ly', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD11b Antigen', 'CD11c Antigen', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Female', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, NK Cell Lectin-Like', 'Spleen']",15598811,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['G12.100'], ['D23.050.301.264.920', 'D23.101.100.920'], ['D23.101'], ['A11.148', 'A15.378.316'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.074.750', 'D12.776.543.550.200.093.750', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.100.150', 'D12.776.543.750.705.833.062', 'D23.050.301.350.074.049'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.074.875', 'D12.776.395.550.200.275.500', 'D12.776.543.550.200.093.875', 'D12.776.543.550.200.275.500', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.100.200', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.600.100.500', 'D12.776.543.750.705.833.249.500', 'D23.050.301.350.074.074', 'D23.050.301.350.275.500'], ['A11.251'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['A11.066.270', 'A11.436.270', 'A15.382.066.270', 'A15.382.670.260'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.250', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.250', 'D23.529.374.440.890.250'], ['D12.776.503.280'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.775.400.100.500', 'D12.644.360.587.100.500', 'D12.776.476.592.100.500', 'D12.776.543.733.937.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.895.800.100', 'D23.050.301.264.920.500', 'D23.101.100.920.500'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.775.300.100', 'D12.644.360.585.100', 'D12.776.476.564.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.895.800'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
24530,Evaluation on treatment of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis against patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome following wasp stings.,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the treatment of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (SLED) against patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) following wasp stings.METHODS: Clinical data of 35 patients with MODS following wasp stings were retrospectively analysed. These patients were divided into three groups according to the treatment strategy used: 1) hemodialysis (HD) group, 2) continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH)/HD group, and 3) SLED/HD group. The clinical parameters, treatment outcome, and safety findings were compared among the three groups.RESULTS: The recovery rate (76.92% vs 77.78% vs 91.67%, p = 0.621) and mortality rate (15.38% vs 11.11% vs 8.33%, p = 0.999) were similar among the three groups. When compared to the HD group, patients treated with CVVH/HD or SLED/HD required a shorter period of time to enter into polyuria stage [(24.7 ± 4.3) days vs (20.2 ± 4.7) days vs (18.2 ± 3.0) days, F = 9.11, p = 0.0007], and required a shorter time for serum creatinine to return to normal [(45.7 ± 13.4) days vs (33.1 ± 9.4) days vs (31.9 ± 9.8), F = 5.83, p = 0.0069]; while such parameters had no significant differences between SLED/HD group and CVVH/HD group. The adverse events of hypotension and arrhythmia were found in the HD group, while no adverse events were reported in the SLED/HD and CVVH/HD groups. There was no significant difference in the cost of blood purification treatment between the SLED/HD group and HD group.CONCLUSION: The use of SLED, CVVH and HD provided a comparable recovery and survival rates in patients with MODS secondary to wasp stings. Compared to HD, the use of SLED is recommended as a treatment strategy because of the efficacy on recover of renal function, satisfactory safety outcome, as well as the reasonable treatment cost.","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insect Bites and Stings', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Wasps']",31269901,"[['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050'], ['E02.870.150', 'E04.292.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C25.723.127.071', 'C26.176.143'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.835.525'], ['E02.870.300', 'E02.912.800'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.875.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40342,Isolation and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies to digoxin.,"Fab preparations of sheep polyclonal anti-digoxin Abs have proven useful for reversal of the toxic effects of digoxin overdoses in patients. Unfortunately, the use of foreign species proteins in humans is limited because of the potential for immunological responses that include hypersensitivity reactions and acute anaphylaxis. Immunization of recently developed transgenic mice, whose endogenous micro heavy and kappa light chain Ig genes are inactivated and which carry human Ig gene segments, with a digoxin-protein conjugate has enabled us to generate and isolate eight hybridoma cell lines secreting human sequence anti-digoxin mAbs. Six of the mAbs have been partially characterized and shown to have high specificity and low nanomolar affinities for digoxin. In addition, detailed competition binding studies performed with three of these mAbs have shown them to have distinct differences in their digoxin binding, and that all three structural moieties of the drug, the primary digitoxose sugar, steroid, and five-member unsaturated lactone ring, contribute to Ab recognition.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Digoxin', 'Haptens', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Species Specificity']",10438974,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['G12.040', 'G12.122.125'], ['G02.111.570.060.425.079', 'G02.111.570.120.408', 'G12.122.232', 'G12.125'], ['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['D04.210.500.155.580.130.500.436', 'D04.210.500.155.580.130.688', 'D09.408.180.261.436'], ['D23.050.550.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.251.353.485', 'A11.251.600.485'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['D12.644.541.500.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.797', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.790.651.797', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650.500', 'D12.776.377.715.548.797', 'G02.111.570.060.425'], ['E02.319.267.530.490'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.440', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.440'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['G16.824']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15087,Changes in carotenoid content and biosynthetic gene expression in juice sacs of four orange varieties (Citrus sinensis) differing in flesh fruit color.,"The contribution of carotenoid composition to the color range of the fruit juice sacs of four orange varieties (Citrus sinensis) differing in flesh color, namely, Shamouti (normal orange color), Sanguinelli (""blood cultivar"" purple color), Cara Cara navel (pink-reddish), and Huang pi Chen (yellowish color), was investigated. To this end, qualitative and quantitative analyses of carotenoid contents were first performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C30 column and a photodiode array detector in February, at a late developmental fruit stage. Concomitantly, transcript levels of Dxs, the gene controlling the first step of the MEP pathway, and six genes involved in beta,beta-xanthophyll biosynthesis (Psy, Pds, Zds, Lcy-b, Hy-b, and Zep) were determined in August, November, and February. Transcript level measurement was carried out by real-time RT-PCR on total RNA from juice sacs. The four orange varieties displayed different carotenoid profiles. Shamouti and Sanguinelli oranges accumulated mainly beta,beta-xanthophylls as expected in typically colored oranges, whereas Cara Cara navel orange accumulated linear carotenes in addition to cis-violaxanthin. Huang pi Chen fruit flesh orange was characterized by a strong reduction of total carotenoid content. Whereas gene expression was relatively low and similar in August (before color break) in all four varieties, in November (during color break), Dxs, Zds, Hy-b, and Zep expression was higher in Cara Cara and Huang pi Chen oranges. The beta,beta-xanthophyll accumulation observed in February in Shamouti and Sanguinelli oranges was apparently related to the increase of transcript levels of all measured genes (i.e., Dxs, Psy, Pds, Zds, Hy-b, and Zep) except Lcy-b. At this time, however, transcript levels in Cara Cara were rather similar to those found in Sanguinelli, although both showed different carotenoid compositions. The Huang pi Chen phenotype correlated with lower expression of Dxs and Psy genes. These results revealed a general pattern of transcript change in juice sacs of citrus fruit, characterized by an apparent coordination of Dxs and Psy expression and a general increase in mRNA levels of carotenoid biosynthetic genes. These transcript changes correlated well with the beta,beta-xanthophyll accumulation, the normal carotenoid set, observed in Shamouti and Sanguinelli oranges and suggest that the preferential accumulation of linear carotenes in Cara Cara navel and the practical absence of carotenoids in Huang pi Chen oranges were not predominantly due to changes in regulation of carotenoid biosynthetic genes at the transcriptional level.","['Carotenoids', 'Citrus', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Pigmentation', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Species Specificity']",18433104,"[['D02.455.326.271.665.202', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249', 'D02.455.849.131', 'D23.767.261'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.875.177'], ['E05.393.220'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['G05.297'], ['E01.370.600.620', 'G16.690'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['G16.824']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The extent of genetic variation has been examined in patients with AIDS, but little is known regarding the appearance of HIV-1 genetic variation immediately following infection during the primary phase of HIV-1 infection prior to seroconversion.DESIGN: We examined HIV-1 genetic variation during this early phase of HIV-1 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequence analysis of the V4 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequence analysis of the V4 variable region and the CD4-binding domain.RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that extensive sequence variation is seen early after infection, although a predominant HIV-1 species is maintained.CONCLUSIONS: The type of variants that occur are dynamic, changing over time, and the mutations seen are consistent with those expected from random occurrence, unlike the pattern of variation previously reported during later stages of disease.","['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Genetic Variation', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1616650,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['G05.365'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B04.820.650.589.650.350.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G02.111.810.550', 'G05.810.550']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
48268,Classifying single-trial EEG during motor imagery by iterative spatio-spectral patterns learning (ISSPL).,"In most current motor-imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), machine learning is carried out in two consecutive stages: feature extraction and feature classification. Feature extraction has focused on automatic learning of spatial filters, with little or no attention being paid to optimization of parameters for temporal filters that still require time-consuming, ad hoc manual tuning. In this paper, we present a new algorithm termed iterative spatio-spectral patterns learning (ISSPL) that employs statistical learning theory to perform automatic learning of spatio-spectral filters. In ISSPL, spectral filters and the classifier are simultaneously parameterized for optimization to achieve good generalization performance. A detailed derivation and theoretical analysis of ISSPL are given. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed algorithm can correctly identify the discriminative frequency bands, demonstrating the algorithm's superiority over contemporary approaches in classification performance.","['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Humans', 'Imagination', 'Movement', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated']",18714838,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['G17.035.250', 'L01.224.050.375'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['G07.265.216.500.385', 'G11.561.200.500.385'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.188.634'], ['G07.568', 'G11.427.410'], ['L01.399.750']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
12541,"""Man-ing"" up and getting drunk: the role of masculine norms, alcohol intoxication and alcohol-related problems among college men.","Compared to college women, college men face elevated risks for problematic drinking and negative alcohol-related consequences. These risks highlight the critical need to investigate gender issues and risk factors contributing to intoxication and related problems among men. Theoretical models suggest that conforming to masculine norms or the beliefs and expectations of what it means to be a man, may help explain patterns of problematic drinking among men. The current study advances the literature by investigating the association between masculine norms, drinking to intoxication, and alcohol-related consequences among 776 undergraduate males after taking into account the importance of fraternity status and perceived peer norms. Results indicate that fraternity status and higher perceived peer norms regarding drinking increased the risks of getting drunk and experiencing alcohol-related consequences. Specifically, the masculine norms of being a ""playboy"", risk-taking, and winning were risk factors of drinking to intoxication; while, being a ""playboy"", risk-taking, and self-reliance increased the risks of alcohol-related problems. Primacy of work and heterosexual presentation were two masculine norms that were protective of drinking to intoxication. Our findings contribute to important future considerations for prevention, clinical interventions, and public-health implications in college settings.","['Alcohol Drinking', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'California', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Masculinity', 'Peer Group', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Conformity', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Universities', 'Young Adult']",21620570,"[['F01.145.317.269'], ['C25.775.100.175', 'F03.900.100.300'], ['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.813.376', 'F01.393.446.250.750', 'F01.752.747.385.200.750'], ['F01.829.316.483'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.813.625'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['I02.783.830', 'J03.832.830'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

5793,Prostaglandin F2 alpha isopropyl ester versus iloprost phenacyl ester in rabbit and beagle eyes.,"One and 2 micrograms of prostaglandin F2 alpha isopropyl ester (PGF2 alpha -IE) applied topically to the rabbit eye caused a biphasic response. The hypotensive phase was dose-dependent with a maximum reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) of 9.4 +/- 1.7 mmHg at a dose of 2 micrograms. In beagles, 0.4 to 2 micrograms topical PGF2 alpha-IE resulted in a sustained IOP reduction; 2 micrograms produced the maximum reduction of 7-9 mmHg. No initial hypertensive response was observed. Iloprost phenacyl ester (Iloprost-PE) caused a greater decrease in IOP when dissolved in 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (AT) than in saline. In rabbits, doses of 0.1 to 1 microgram in AT caused a biphasic response with a sustained IOP decrease fluctuating between 7 and 8 mmHg. In beagles 1 and 2 micrograms Iloprost-PE resulted in a mean IOP reduction of 5.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg and 5.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg (P less than 0.005), respectively; the decrease persisted for 5 hrs. No initial hypertensive response was observed. In beagles PGF2 alpha-IE induced a strong miosis lasting more than 6 hours; Iloprost-PE had no effect on pupil size. Both PG-esters induced a slight hyperemia in rabbit and beagle eyes. In rabbits Iloprost-PE affects the blood-aqueous barrier more than PGF2 alpha-IE, since higher protein concentrations are seen in the aqueous humor after application of Iloprost-PE. Neither PG-ester had a noticeable effect on aqueous protein in beagles. In rabbits, both PG-esters led to slightly increased aqueous humor cyclic-AMP concentrations.

39520,Variables explaining health-related quality of life in community-dwelling older adults.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although health-related quality of life (HRQL) has been linked to numerous factors in older adults, limited or conflicting studies have investigated variables explaining HRQL in healthy, community-dwelling older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine whether physical activity, gait speed, balance, strength, endurance, and flexibility were associated with HRQL in healthy, community-dwelling older adults.METHODS: Participants of this cross-sectional, correlational research design study included residents of a senior living community, aged 60 years and older who were independent in at least unlimited household ambulation. These residents participated in tests of physical activity, gait speed, balance, strength, endurance, flexibility, and HRQL (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey, SF-36). The physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores of the SF-36 were calculated.RESULTS: Data were collected on 84 participants (mean [SD] age = 78.6 (5.9) years, 54.8% women). Significant correlations were found between the PCS and fast gait speed (FGS) (r = 0.43; p < .001), the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (r = 0.44; p < .001), 8-ft up-and-go (r = -0.34; p = .002), and chair stand (r = 0.37; P = .001). Only body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.30; p = .007) was significantly correlated with MCS. Forward stepwise linear regression analyses were conducted, controlling for age, sex, and BMI, to identify factors associated with the PCS and MCS. In the model using PCS as the dependent variable, FGS accounted for 26% of the variance (R2 change) in PCS over and above age, sex, and BMI (R2 change = 0.03); for the full model, F = 5.37, p = .001. In the regression analysis using MCS as the dependent variable, only the 8-ft up-and-go was retained (R2 change = 0.06) over and above age, sex, and BMI (R2 change = 0.16); for the full model, F = 3.71, p = .01.DISCUSSION: Fast gait speed, balance, and lower body strength were associated with the PCS of the SF-36; however, FGS was the only variable that uniquely contributed to the variance in the PCS. Body mass index was associated with the MCS; however, only balance uniquely contributed to the variance in the MCS. Physical activity was not associated with the PCS or MCS.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the assessment of FGS in community-dwelling older adults to gain insight into physical health status. Interventions directed toward FGS, balance, and BMI may contribute to optimum HRQL in this population.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Strength', 'Physical Fitness', 'Quality of Life', 'Residence Characteristics']",23959246,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['E05.318.308.980.438', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.600.425', 'G11.427.560'], ['G11.427.685', 'I03.450.642.845.054.800', 'N01.400.545'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['N01.224.791', 'N06.850.505.400.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
29863,Infant feeding patterns over the first year of life: influence of family characteristics.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Early eating patterns and behaviors can determine later eating habits and food preferences and they have been related to the development of childhood overweight and obesity. We aimed to identify patterns of feeding in the first year of life and to examine their associations with family characteristics.SUBJECTS/METHODS: Our analysis included 1004 infants from the EDEN mother-child cohort. Feeding practices were assessed through maternal self-report at birth, 4, 8 and 12 months. Principal component analysis was applied to derive patterns from breastfeeding duration, age at complementary food (CF) introduction and type of food used at 1 year. Associations between patterns and family characteristics were analyzed by linear regressions.RESULTS: The main source of variability in infant feeding was characterized by a pattern labeled 'late CF introduction and use of ready-prepared baby foods'. Older, more educated, primiparous women with high monthly income ranked high on this pattern. The second pattern, labeled 'longer breastfeeding, late CF introduction and use of home-made foods' was the closest to infant feeding guidelines. Mothers ranking high on this pattern were older and more educated. The third pattern, labeled 'use of adults' foods' suggests a less age-specific diet for the infants. Mothers ranking high on this pattern were often younger and multiparous. Recruitment center was related to all patterns.CONCLUSIONS: Not only maternal education level and age, but also parity and region are important contributors to the variability in patterns. Further studies are needed to describe associations between these patterns and infant growth and later food preferences.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cohort Studies', 'Educational Status', 'Family Characteristics', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Parity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Self Report']",23299715,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['F01.145.407.199', 'G07.203.650.195', 'G07.203.650.220.500.500', 'G07.203.650.353.199'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['N01.824.196'], ['F01.829.263.315', 'I01.240.361', 'I01.880.853.150.423', 'N01.224.361', 'N01.824.308', 'N06.850.505.400.400'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G07.203.300.525.500', 'J02.500.525.500'], ['G07.203.650.220.500'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['F01.829.263.370.215'], ['G08.686.677', 'G08.686.784.769.472', 'N06.850.490.812.600'], ['E05.318.740.562'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.308.980.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
524,Tafluprost protects rat retinal ganglion cells from apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND: To investigate whether tafluprost, which is a prostaglandin-related compound and an anti-glaucoma drug, has a direct anti-apoptotic effect in cultured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and rat RGCs in retinas with optic nerve crush (ONC).METHODS: RGC-5 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by a serum deprivation and by exogenous glutamate. The level of cell death with or without tafluprost was monitored by an XTT assay and by immunocytochemistry with activated caspase-3. Changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) levels were measured with fluo-4 fluorescence. Rat RGCs were degenerated by ONC. After topical instillation of tafluprost for 7 and 14 days, the numbers of retrograde-labeled RGCs were counted. Retinal flatmounts were subjected to terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining to detect apoptotic cells.RESULTS: Tafluprost dose-dependently promoted RGC-5 cell viability with an optimum concentration of 3 microM (p = 0.006). Tafluprost significantly reduced caspase-3-positive cells and suppressed [Ca(+2)]i evoked by exogenous glutamate. The cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor and KT-5823 partially blocked the rescue effect of tafluprost (p = 0.002). The survival rate of RGCs significantly increased in eyes treated with tafluprost (p = 0.01), and the prevalence of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly decreased 14 days after ONC (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that tafluprost has an anti-apoptotic effect in RGCs.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Carbazoles', 'Caspase 3', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutamic Acid', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Instillation, Drug', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Male', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Ophthalmic Solutions', 'Optic Nerve', 'Prostaglandins F', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Time Factors']",19551401,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D27.505.519.562.249', 'D27.505.696.260.500', 'D27.505.954.411.192'], ['D03.633.100.473.144', 'D03.633.300.148'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126.350.300', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126.350.300', 'D12.644.360.075.405.350.300', 'D12.776.476.075.405.350.300'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G04.346'], ['D27.720.470.305.255', 'E07.206.255'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.150.150', 'D12.644.360.200.150', 'D12.776.476.200.150'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['E05.481'], ['E02.319.267.641'], ['A11.284.149.450', 'A11.284.835.514'], ['G14.440'], ['E04.525.210.560'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['D26.776.708.645', 'D27.505.954.578.645', 'D27.720.752.608'], ['A08.800.800.120.680'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.400', 'D23.469.050.175.725.400'], ['D27.505.519.389.755'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['A08.675.650.850.875', 'A09.371.729.831.875', 'A11.671.650.850.875'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6474,Phosphorus deficiency decreases cell division and elongation in grass leaves.,"Leaf growth in monocotyledons results from the flux of newly born cells out of the division zone and into the adjacent elongation-only zone, where cells reach their final length. We used a kinematic method to analyze the effect of phosphorus nutrition status on cell division and elongation parameters in the epidermis of Lolium perenne. Phosphorus deficiency reduced the leaf elongation rate by 39% due to decreases in the cell production rate (-19%) and final cell length (-20%). The former was solely due to a lower average cell division rate (0.028 versus 0.046 cell cell(-1) h(-1)) and, thus, a lengthened average cell cycle duration (25 versus 15 h). The number of division cycles of the initial cell progeny (five to six) and, as a result, the number of meristematic cells (32-64) and division zone length were independent of phosphorus status. Accordingly, low-phosphorus cells maintained meristematic activity longer. Lack of effect of phosphorus deficiency on meristematic cell length implies that a lower division rate was matched to a lower elongation rate. Phosphorus deficiency did not affect the elongation-only zone length, thus leading to longer cell elongation duration (99 versus 75 h). However, the substantially reduced postmitotic average relative elongation rate (0.045 versus 0.064 mm mm(-1) h(-1)) resulted in shorter mature cells. In summary, phosphorus deficiency did not affect the general controls of cell morphogenesis, but, by slowing down the rates of cell division and expansion, it slowed down its pace.","['Cell Division', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Shape', 'Phosphorus', 'Plant Leaves', 'Poaceae']",16648218,"[['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G04.320'], ['D01.268.666'], ['A18.024.812'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
40644,Mutation and evolution of microsatellite loci in Neurospora.,"The patterns of mutation and evolution at 13 microsatellite loci were studied in the filamentous fungal genus Neurospora. First, a detailed investigation was performed on five microsatellite loci by sequencing each microsatellite, together with its nonrepetitive flanking regions, from a set of 147 individuals from eight species of Neurospora. To elucidate the genealogical relationships among microsatellite alleles, repeat number was mapped onto trees constructed from flanking-sequence data. This approach allowed the potentially convergent microsatellite mutations to be placed in the evolutionary context of the less rapidly evolving flanking regions, revealing the complexities of the mutational processes that have generated the allelic diversity conventionally assessed in population genetic studies. In addition to changes in repeat number, frequent substitution mutations within the microsatellites were detected, as were substitutions and insertion/deletions within the flanking regions. By comparing microsatellite and flanking-sequence divergence, clear evidence of interspecific allele length homoplasy and microsatellite mutational saturation was observed, suggesting that these loci are not appropriate for inferring phylogenetic relationships among species. In contrast, little evidence of intraspecific mutational saturation was observed, confirming the utility of these loci for population-level analyses. Frequency distributions of alleles within species were generally consistent with the stepwise mutational model. By comparing variation within species at the microsatellites and the flanking-sequence, estimated microsatellite mutation rates were approximately 2500 times greater than mutation rates of flanking DNA and were consistent with estimates from yeast and fruit flies. A positive relationship between repeat number and variance in repeat number was significant across three genealogical depths, suggesting that longer microsatellite alleles are more mutable than shorter alleles. To test if the observed patterns of microsatellite variation and mutation could be generalized, an additional eight microsatellite loci were characterized and sequenced from a subset of the same Neurospora individuals.","['Base Sequence', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurospora']",15579682,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.045.250', 'G16.075.250'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['G05.365'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.340.024.850.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['B01.300.107.800.629']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

48776,Modulation of histamine type II receptors on CD8+ T cells by interleukin-2 and cimetidine.,CD8+ T cells are known to play a major role in regulating immune functions under normal and disease conditions. In this study a radioligand binding assay was used to quantitate histamine type II (H2) receptors on activated T cells. The objective was to examine the expression of H2 receptors on T cells during activation with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and treatment with cimetidine. Activated suppressor T cells induced by concanavalin A+IL-2 showed a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in H2 receptors compared to the control nonactivated T cells. The T cells expressing the H2 receptors were identified as CD8+ cells; those among them that had an enhanced level of H2 receptors were identified as CD25+. Treatment of activated suppressor cells with the H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine at a concentration of 10(-5) M significantly reduced the number of H2 receptors. Suppressor cells induced by Con A+IL-2 were able to suppress both IgG and IgM production that was reversible with cimetidine. Incubation of lymphocytes with 50 U/ml IL-2 alone in 3-day culture significantly (p less than 0.005) enhanced H2 receptor expression. These studies demonstrate that activated suppressor T cells that are CD8+CD25+ have enhanced levels of H2 receptors and can be modulated by cimetidine.,"['Antibody Formation', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cimetidine', 'Concanavalin A', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2', 'Receptors, Histamine H2', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory']",1533853,"[['G12.450.050.370.250'], ['D23.050.301.264.894.108', 'D23.101.100.894.108'], ['A11.251'], ['D02.078.370.200', 'D03.383.129.308.130'], ['D12.776.503.499.500', 'D12.776.765.678.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.021', 'D12.644.276.374.480.372', 'D12.776.467.374.465.021', 'D12.776.467.374.480.372', 'D23.529.374.465.155', 'D23.529.374.480.372'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.450.400', 'D12.776.543.750.695.355', 'D12.776.543.750.720.480.400'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.420.320'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.550.500', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.500', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.500', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.500', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.500', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.500'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.550.500.700', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.200.700', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.500.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.500.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.500.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.500.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.500.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
30720,[Serotype profile and antibiotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from nasal carriage in pediatric patients].,"The aim of this study was to determine the serotype profile and antibiotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae from nasal isolates in children. Nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 125 children were cultivated and screened for the presence of S. pneumoniae. Strains were identified according to standard microbiological methods. The isolates were serotyped by the Quellung reaction and resistance patterns were determined by the microdilution method according to NCCLS guidelines. Results indicate an overall pneumococcal carriage rate of 24% (n = 30). The most commonly isolated serotypes were 23F (20%), 6B (20%) and 14 (13%). 73% of isolates were resistant at least to one of the tested antibiotics. 47% of the strains were consistently resistant to penicillin and the serotypes 6B and 23F were frequently associated with this marker. 60% of the strains were resistant to doxycycline, 37% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin, 30% to erythromycin, 23% to cloramphenicol, 7% to ceftriaxone and 3% to cefepime. All strains were sensible to ofloxacin, rifampin and vancomycin. The most common combined resistance patterns were PNC-ERI-TMP/SMX-DOX-CLO-CLI (16.59%) and PNC-DOX (13.27%). The results obtained in this study will allow to orient the empiric therapy for pneumococcal infections and a rational use of antibiotics in clinical practice, as well as the application of an appropriate vaccination program specially adapted to the serotypes more frequently found in children.","['Carrier State', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nose', 'Serotyping', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae']",16562641,"[['N06.850.520.169'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['A01.456.505.733', 'A04.531', 'A09.531'], ['E01.370.225.812.742', 'E01.370.225.875.150.125.890', 'E05.200.812.742', 'E05.200.875.150.125.890', 'E05.478.594.780'], ['C01.150.252.410.890'], ['B03.353.750.737.872.550', 'B03.510.400.800.872.550', 'B03.510.550.737.872.550']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
14209,Fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids and bile acids as determinants of colonic mucosal cell proliferation in humans.,"We studied the correlation between fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), bile acids (BA), and colonic mucosal proliferation in humans on a free diet. Subjects [n = 43: 27 men and 16 women; 61 +/- 7 and 59 +/- 6 (SE) yr old, respectively] were outpatients who previously underwent resection of at least two sporadic colon polyps. Mucosal proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation in vitro in three colorectal biopsies obtained without cathartics and was expressed as labeling index (LI). BA were analyzed in feces by mass spectrometry and SCFA by gas chromatography. We found that increasing levels of BA in feces did not correlate with higher LI. On the contrary, higher levels of SCFA were significantly associated with lower LI in the colonic mucosa (P for trend = 0.02). In conclusion, in humans on a free diet, intestinal proliferation seems to be regulated by the levels of SCFA in feces and not by BA. Because a lower intestinal proliferation is associated with a decreased colon cancer risk, treatments or diets that increase colonic levels of SCFA might be beneficial for colonic mucosa.","['Aged', 'Bile Acids and Salts', 'Cell Division', 'Colon', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Diet', 'Fatty Acids', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",12416258,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D04.210.500.105'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A03.556.124.526.356', 'A03.556.249.249.356'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['D10.251'], ['A12.459'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['M01.060.116.630']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
26211,Retroperitoneal schwannoma extending into the intravertebral foramen.,"A 35-year-old Japanese man first visited the hospital for episodes of numbness in the right medial femoral region and loss of muscular strength in the right thigh. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a 10 x 9-cm well-circumscribed in homogeneous multilayered mass, in contact with the lumbar vertebrae. MRI demonstrated a hypodense and hyperdense mixed mass. Tumor extension into the L(2)/L(3) intravertebral foramen was shown. To avoid spinal cord damage, we chose enucleation of the tumor in the intravertebral foramen. A follow-up CT after 1 year showed no evidence of a recurrent mass.

3932,Effects of sodium intake on lactation and Na levels in body fluids of Blackface ewes.,"1. A low-sodium diet was given to Blackface ewes over two reproductive seasons; the diet provided 3-7 mmol Na daily, except for the period of lactation, when Na intake was increased to around 11 mmol/d. The diet of the control ewes was supplemented with sodium chloride to provide the recommended allowance of about ten times the level in the experimental low-Na diet. 2. Milk production was assessed during the first 2 months of lactation from incremental changes in the live weight of lambs during controlled sucking periods. Na and potassium were determined in milk and also in plasma, saliva and urine. 3. Neither yield nor concentration of Na and K in milk was affected by the level of Na in the diet. These results were supported by the similarity in live-weight gain of lambs in both years regardless of diet. 4. Plasma Na and K concentrations were not affected by the level of dietary Na. Na concentration in saliva and urine was significantly lower in the treated than in the control ewes, and K concentration in saliva was significantly higher.","['Animals', 'Body Fluids', 'Female', 'Lactation', 'Milk', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Potassium', 'Pregnancy', 'Sheep', 'Sodium', 'Sodium, Dietary']",3676195,"[['B01.050'], ['A12.207'], ['G08.686.523', 'G08.686.702.500'], ['A12.200.455', 'A12.790', 'G07.203.100.700', 'G07.203.300.350.525', 'J02.200.700', 'J02.500.350.525'], ['G02.640'], ['D01.268.549.550', 'D01.268.557.575', 'D01.552.528.652', 'D01.552.547.650'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['D01.857.875']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

14288,Lifetime burden of mood swings and activation of brain norepinephrine turnover in patients with treatment-refractory depressive illness.,"BACKGROUND: We tested if duration and intensity of episodes in treatment-resistant affectively ill patients were related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of monoamine metabolites.METHOD: In retrospective life charts were recorded every previous episode of 37 patients with severe treatment-refractory affective disorders. 'Accumulated burden of mood swings' (ABMS, sum of each episode length x episode depth) was used to estimate the accumulated illness burden. Homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were analyzed in CSF of all patients and compared with 27 healthy controls. Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis.RESULTS: CSF MHPG contributed strongly significant and positively to the ABMS.LIMITATIONS: The retrospective nature of the study.CONCLUSION: CSF concentrations of MHPG is positively related to ABMS over life.

40598,Pathogenesis of schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations: a neural model.,"We implement and study a computational model of Stevens' theory of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This theory hypothesizes that the onset of schizophrenia is associated with reactive synaptic regeneration in brain regions that receive degenerating temporal lobe projections. Concentrating on one such area, the frontal cortex, we model a frontal module as an associative memory neural network whose input synapses represent incoming temporal projections. Modeling Stevens' hypothesized pathological synaptic changes in this framework results in adverse side effects similar to hallucinations and delusions seen in schizophrenia: spontaneous, stimulus-independent retrieval of stored memories focused on just a few of the stored patterns. These could account for the delusions and hallucinations that occur in schizophrenia without any apparent external trigger and for their tendency to concentrate on a few central cognitive and perceptual themes. The model explains why the positive symptoms of schizophrenia tend to wane as the disease progresses, why delayed therapeutic intervention leads to a much slower response, and why delusions and hallucinations may persist for a long time when they do occur.","['Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Delusions', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Hallucinations', 'Humans', 'Mental Recall', 'Models, Neurological', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Net', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Neural Pathways', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology', 'Synapses', 'Temporal Lobe']",8685653,"[['A08.186.211'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['F01.145.126.200'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['C10.597.606.762.300', 'C23.888.592.604.764.300', 'F01.700.750.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425.540.641'], ['E05.599.395.642'], ['C23.550.737'], ['A08.511'], ['G11.561.585', 'G16.762.611'], ['G17.485', 'L01.224.050.375.605'], ['A08.612'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['F03.700.750'], ['F04.824'], ['A08.850', 'A11.284.149.165.420.780'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.863']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4818,Prostate secretions from men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome inhibit proinflammatory mediators.,"PURPOSE: In the past numerous chemokines have been noted in the expressed prostatic secretions of patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. We examined the functional effects of chemokines in expressed prostatic secretions of patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the functional effects of expressed prostatic secretions on human monocytes by examining monocyte chemotaxis in response to monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a major chemoattractant previously identified in chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome cases. We determined effects on cellular signaling by quantifying intracellular calcium increase in monocytes and nuclear factor-êB activation in normal prostate epithelial cells.RESULTS: Results show that the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in expressed prostatic secretions is nonfunctional with an inability to mediate human monocyte chemotaxis, or mediate signaling in monocytes or prostate epithelial cells. This lack of functionality could be extended to other proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1â and tumor necrosis factor-á, when incubated with expressed prostatic secretions from patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The mechanism underlying this apparent ability to modulate proinflammatory cytokines involves heat labile extracellular proteases that mediate the inhibition of immune and prostate epithelial cell function.CONCLUSIONS: These results may have implications for the design of specific diagnostic and therapeutic methods targeted toward the complete resolution of prostate inflammatory insults.","['Chemokine CCL2', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Male', 'Prostate', 'Prostatitis']",20723928,"[['D12.644.276.374.200.110.990.600', 'D12.776.467.374.200.110.990.600', 'D23.125.300.110.990.600', 'D23.469.200.110.990.600', 'D23.529.374.200.110.990.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D23.469'], ['A05.360.444.575', 'A10.336.707'], ['C12.294.565.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33146,Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 Causes Antibody Deficiency.,"PURPOSE: Determining the monogenic cause of antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation in a non-consanguineous family with healthy parents, two affected children, and one unaffected child.METHODS: Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed in the index family. WES results were confirmed by Sanger Sequencing. Dried plasma spots of the male patient and his mother were analyzed for ADA2 enzymatic activity.RESULTS: Following data analysis of WES, we found a compound heterozygous mutation in CECR1 (encoding adenosine deaminase 2, ADA2) that segregated in the two affected children. Enzyme activity measurement confirmed a severely diminished ADA2 activity in our patient. The 32 year old index patient was suffering from recurrent respiratory infections and was previously diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), showing no signs of vasculitis. His sister had a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like phenotype and died at age 17.CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of ADA2 (DADA2) has been reported to cause vasculopathy and early-onset stroke.

42759,Chronic nicotine treatment eliminates asymmetry in striatal glucose utilization following unilateral transection of the mesostriatal dopamine pathway in rats.,"Partial hemitransection was performed through a knife lesion at the meso-diencephalic level in rats to sever the mesostriatal dopamine system. During the subsequent 2 weeks the animals received 0.125 mg/kg/h of nicotine continuously via an osmotic minipump implanted s.c. To achieve prompt high nicotine levels, 4 i.p. injections of 0.5 mg/kg nicotine were, in addition, given during the first 2 h following the lesion. The total treatment corresponded to a mean plasma level of 50 ng/ml nicotine, measured at the end of the experiment. Control animals received corresponding volumes of 0.9% saline. Quantitative autoradiographic analysis of the glucose utilization in the caudate nucleus using Sokoloff's [14C]2-deoxyglucose method demonstrated a 16% side-to-side difference in the lesioned control animals, whereas the asymmetry was counteracted by the nicotine treatment. Although there was an overall tendency to a lower rate of glucose utilization (by 6%) in the nicotine-treated animals compared to the controls receiving saline only, the difference was not statistically significant. The eliminated asymmetry probably reflects an increased survival of the dopamine neurons and/or of striatal nerve cells on the lesioned side due to protective effects of nicotine resulting from desensitization of nicotinic-type cholinergic receptors following continuous administration of the drug.","['Animals', 'Caudate Nucleus', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Corpus Striatum', 'Cotinine', 'Denervation', 'Deoxyglucose', 'Dopamine', 'Glucose', 'Male', 'Nicotine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",2812507,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487.550.184'], ['E05.196.181.349'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487'], ['D03.383.773.812.180'], ['E04.525.210'], ['D09.254.229'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D03.132.760.570', 'D03.383.725.518'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
10100,Altered â-catenin expression in oral mucosal dysplasia: a comparative study.,"OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to investigate the â-catenin expression in oral leukoplakia (OL) with different degrees of epithelial dysplasia and normal oral mucosa.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 39 OL (mild dysplasia n=19, moderate dysplasia n=13, and severe dysplasia n=7), and 10 normal oral mucosa (control group) were submitted to immunohistochemical reactions to anti-â-catenin primary antibody. A qualitative â-catenin analysis was performed based on the percentage of positive cells. The cellular location and the epithelial layer were also considered. The Chi-square test and the Fisher's exact test were used to verify possible differences in the â-catenin expression among the OL groups. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: Membranous expression of â-catenin in parabasal and basal layers was gradually lost in the higher degrees of epithelial dysplasia. In normal oral mucosa, â-catenin was detected only in the cytoplasmic membrane. However, a significant increase in cytoplasmic â-catenin could be observed between mild and moderate dysplasia (Fisher Exact test - p<0.001) and between mild and severe dysplasia (p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The â-catenin cytoplasmic expression observed in this study may represent the initial stage of modifications in the E-cadherin-catenin complex, along with morphological cellular changes.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Membrane', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukoplakia, Oral', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Reference Values', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'beta Catenin']",26537717,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['A11.284.149'], ['A11.436'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['C04.588.443.591.545', 'C04.834.512.513', 'C07.465.530.545', 'C23.300.816.513'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A10.615.550.599', 'A14.549.512'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.440.610', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.440.610', 'E05.200.500.620.760.440.610', 'E05.200.750.600.760.440.610'], ['E05.978.810'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['D12.776.091.249', 'D12.776.220.145.500', 'D12.776.930.130']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

26424,Primary malignant melanoma of the vagina.,"BACKGROUND: Primary vaginal melanoma is a rare, highly malignant, and poor prognostic disease.CASE: The 51-year-old patient with diagnosis of vaginal malignant melanoma was referred to our clinic. Since detection of pervasive brown lesions in the vagina total vaginectomy was performed. At pathological investigation melanoma was not determined. Immunotherapy was administered adjuvantly. Paraaortic lymph node metastasis was seen on the ninth month after total vaginectomy and the metastatic lymph nodes were excised. Cisplatin and tremozolamide chemotherapy was administered for six cycles after surgery. The patient is alive and disease-free at 18th month of the diagnosis of the disease.CONCLUSION: The impact of therapy on outcome of primary vaginal malign melanomas is poorly understood. Improved clinical outcomes were associated with surgical removal of gross disease whenever possible. Because of the low rate of lymph node metastasis, elective pelvic lymph node dissection is not mandatory. We presented a case of FIGO stage I primary vaginal malignant melanoma, which metastasized to the paraaortic lymph nodes 9 months after the primary operation.","['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cisplatin', 'Dacarbazine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Melanoma', 'Middle Aged', 'Temozolomide', 'Vaginal Neoplasms']",19242707,"[['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D01.210.375', 'D01.625.125', 'D01.710.100'], ['D02.925.200', 'D03.383.129.308.240'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.250', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.250', 'D23.529.374.440.890.250'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510', 'C04.557.665.510'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.925.200.500', 'D03.383.129.308.240.500'], ['C04.588.945.418.955', 'C13.351.500.894.834', 'C13.351.937.418.937']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
19164,Is transcutaneous oxygen tension independent of variations in blood flow and in arterial blood pressure?,"Whether transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) is independent of minor variations in perfusion under the TcPO2 electrode, as is claimed, was studied in 18 feet of 16 young healthy adults. The TcPO2 electrode was mounted on the dorsum of the foot and operated at 43 degrees C, while the blood pressure was changed by elevating and lowering the foot. During elevation the mean arterial blood pressure decreased corresponding to the hydrostatic pressure of the column of blood between the heart and the position of the foot. In every experiment TcPO2 decreased when the foot was elevated at an average rate of 1.2% per millimeter Hg change in mean arterial blood pressure. TcPO2 was negatively correlated to blood flow in normal unheated tissue, but significantly and positively correlated to blood flow in the heated, vasodilated tissue under the TcPO2 electrode. In the heated tissue normal blood flow regulation was abolished, and the perfusion under the electrode was mainly determined by the arterial blood pressure. It is concluded that TcPO2 in adults--and probably also in neonates--is affected by the minor or large variations in the perfusion under the electrode caused by fluctuations in arterial blood pressure.","['Adult', 'Blood Gas Analysis', 'Blood Pressure', 'Electrodes', 'Female', 'Foot', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oxygen', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Respiration', 'Skin']",7159703,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.100', 'E01.370.386.700.100', 'E05.200.124.100.100'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E07.305.250'], ['A01.378.610.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['G09.330.100.780'], ['G09.772.705'], ['A17.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

15629,Antibody mimics based on human fibronectin type three domain engineered for thermostability and high-affinity binding to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor two.,"The tenth human fibronectin type three domain ((10)Fn3) is a small (10 kDa), extremely stable and soluble protein with an immunoglobulin-like fold, but without cysteine residues. Selections from (10)Fn3-based libraries of proteins with randomized loops have yielded high-affinity, target-specific antibody mimics. However, little is known about the biophysical properties of such antibody mimics, which will determine their suitability for in vitro and medical applications. We characterized target binding and biophysical properties of two related (10)Fn3-based antibody mimics that bind vascular endothelial growth factor receptor two (VEGF-R2). The first antibody mimic, which has a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 13 nM, is highly stable [melting temperature (T(m))=62 degrees C] and soluble, whereas the second, which binds VEGF-R2 with 40 x higher affinity, is less stable (T(m) < 40 degrees C) and relatively insoluble. We used our understanding of these two (10)Fn3 derivatives and of wild-type (10)Fn3 structure to engineer the next generation of antibody mimics, which have an improved combination of high affinity (K(d)=0.59 nM), stability (T(m)=53 degrees C) and solubility. Our findings illustrate that (10)Fn3-based antibody mimics can be engineered for favorable biophysical properties even when 20% of the wild-type (10)Fn3 sequence is mutated in order to satisfy target-binding requirements.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Fibronectins', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Engineering', 'Solubility', 'Thermodynamics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2']",16087651,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114'], ['D12.776.377.715.390', 'D12.776.395.550.350', 'D12.776.543.550.350', 'D12.776.860.300.450'], ['G01.906.595.543', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.380', 'G16.500.750.775.710.380', 'N06.230.300.100.725.232', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.560', 'G05.545', 'G16.012.750.500'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G01.154.651.750.500', 'G02.111.688.750.500'], ['E05.393.420.601'], ['G02.805'], ['G01.906'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.950.200', 'D12.776.543.750.630.750.200', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.910.200']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
16405,Neutrophil elastase contributes to the development of ischemia-reperfusion-induced liver injury by decreasing endothelial production of prostacyclin in rats.,"We previously reported that nitric oxide (NO) derived from endothelial NO synthase (NOS) increased endothelial prostacyclin (PGI(2)) production in rats subjected to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). The present study was undertaken to determine whether neutrophil elastase (NE) decreases endothelial production of PGI(2), thereby contributing to the development of I/R-induced liver injury by decreasing hepatic tissue blood flow in rats. Hepatic tissue levels of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), a stable metabolite of PGI(2), were transiently increased and peaked at 1 h after reperfusion, followed by a gradual decrease until 3 h after reperfusion. Sivelestat sodium hydrochloride and L-658,758, two NE inhibitors, reduced I/R-induced liver injury. These substances inhibited the decreases in hepatic tissue levels of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) at 2 and 3 h after reperfusion but did not affect the levels at 1 h after reperfusion. These NE inhibitors significantly increased hepatic tissue blood flow from 1 to 3 h after reperfusion. Both hepatic I/R-induced increases in the accumulation of neutrophils and the microvascular permeability were inhibited by these two NE inhibitors. Protective effects induced by the two NE inhibitors were completely reversed by pretreatment with nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of NOS, or indomethacin. Administration of iloprost, a stable derivative of PGI(2), produced effects similar to those induced by NE inhibitors. These observations strongly suggest that NE might play a critical role in the development of I/R-induced liver injury by decreasing endothelial production of NO and PGI(2), leading to a decrease in hepatic tissue blood flow resulting from inhibition of vasodilation and induction of activated neutrophil-induced microvascular injury.","['6-Ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha', 'Animals', 'Capillary Permeability', 'Cephalosporins', 'Chemokines, CXC', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors', 'Endothelium', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Epoprostenol', 'Glycine', 'Iloprost', 'Indomethacin', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukocyte Elastase', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Male', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III', 'Peroxidase', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Sulfonamides', 'Transaminases', 'Vasodilator Agents']",15246960,"[['D10.251.355.255.550.400.350', 'D10.251.355.325.450', 'D23.469.050.175.725.400.350'], ['B01.050'], ['G03.143.330', 'G09.330.165'], ['D02.065.589.099.249', 'D02.886.665.074', 'D03.633.100.300.249'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.120', 'D12.776.467.374.200.120', 'D23.125.300.120', 'D23.469.200.120', 'D23.529.374.200.120'], ['D27.505.519.389.310', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030.500', 'D27.505.954.329.030.500'], ['A10.272.491'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.550.500', 'D23.469.050.175.725.550.500'], ['D12.125.481'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.775.125', 'D23.469.050.175.725.775.125', 'D23.469.700.275'], ['D03.633.100.473.420'], ['D12.644.276', 'D12.776.467', 'D23.529'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.560.500', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.560.500'], ['A03.620'], ['G09.330.100.881.552'], ['D12.125.068.050.525', 'D12.125.095.104.525'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772.750'], ['D08.811.682.732.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['C14.907.725', 'C23.550.767.877'], ['D02.065.884', 'D02.886.590.700'], ['D08.811.913.477.700'], ['D27.505.954.411.918']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
14908,Protective effect of oxymatrine on chronic rat heart failure.,"Oxymatrine is one of the alkaloids extracted from the Chinese herb Sophora japonica (Sophora flavescens Ait.) with anti-inflammatory, immune reaction inhibiting, antiviral, and hepatocyte and antihepatic fibrosis protective activities. However, the effect of oxymatrine on heart failure is not yet known. In this study, the effect of oxymatrine on heart failure was investigated using a Sprague-Dawley rat model of chronic heart failure. Morphological findings showed that in the group treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg of oxymatrine; intermyofibrillar lysis disappeared, myofilaments were orderly, closely and evenly arranged; and mitochondria contained tightly packed cristae compared with the heart failure group. We investigated the cytosolic Ca(2+) transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content, and assessed the expression of ryanodine receptor (RyR2), SR-Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA2a), and L-type Ca(2+) channel (dihydropyridine receptor, DHPR). We found that the cytosolic Ca(2+) transients were markedly increased in amplitude in the medium- (ÄF/F (0) = 26.22 ± 2.01) and high-dose groups (ÄF/F (0) = 29.49 ± 1.17) compared to the heart failure group (ÄF/F (0) = 12.12 ± 1.35, P < 0.01), with changes paralleled by a significant increase in the SR Ca(2+) content (medium-dose group: ÄF/F (0) = 32.20 ± 1.67, high-dose group: ÄF/F (0) = 32.57 ± 1.29, HF: ÄF/F (0) = 17.26 ± 1.05, P < 0.01). Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression of SERCA2a and cardiac DHPR was significantly increased in the medium- and high-dose group compared with the heart failure rats. These findings suggest that oxymatrine could improve heart failure by improving the cardiac function and that this amelioration is associated with upregulation of SERCA2a and DHPR.","['Alkaloids', 'Animals', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Channels, L-Type', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Chronic Disease', 'Heart Failure', 'Male', 'Mitochondria, Heart', 'Quinolizines', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases']",21691940,"[['D03.132'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.411.097'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.400', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.400', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.400'], ['G02.111.820.800.100', 'G03.143.500.100', 'G04.835.800.100'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['C14.280.434'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564.627.603', 'A11.284.835.626.627.603'], ['D03.633.100.834'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.800', 'D12.776.210.500.800', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.800', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.800'], ['A10.690.552.500.500.850', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.248.310.800'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.250.500', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.500.500', 'D12.776.157.530.813.250.500', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.500.500', 'D12.776.543.585.813.250.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

36963,Severe deficiency of VWF-cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) activity defines a distinct population of thrombotic microangiopathy patients.,"BACKGROUND: Severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity is a biologic risk factor for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). It was hypothesized that severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is associated with a distinct TMA subpopulation.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: ADAMTS13 activity before treatment was determined retrospectively in 107 adult TMA patients treated with plasma exchange. Patients were not clinically categorized, but divided between severely deficient (n = 50) and nonseverely deficient (n = 57) ADAMTS13 activity. Laboratory and clinical factors before treatment were compared between the groups.RESULTS: Median PLT counts were 44,000 per micro L in nonseverely deficient ADAMTS13 patients and 13,000 per micro L in severely deficient ADAMTS13 patients (p < 0.001). Median serum creatinine levels were 2.7 mg per dL in nonseverely deficient patients and 1.2 mg per dL in severely deficient patients (p < 0.001). In surviving patients, median plasma exchange procedures were 9 in nonseverely deficient patients and 14.5 in severely deficient patients (p < 0.01). Rates of relapse following remission were 4 of 47 in nonseverely deficient patients and 16 of 46 in severely deficient patients (p < 0.01). Among analyzed factors only mortality rates were not significantly different.CONCLUSION: In a heterogeneous population of TMA patients treated with plasma exchange, ADAMTS13 activity defined two subpopulations with distinct clinical and laboratory features. These results suggest that TMA with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is a distinct pathologic process.","['ADAM Proteins', 'ADAMTS13 Protein', 'Creatinine', 'Humans', 'Metalloendopeptidases', 'Plasma Exchange', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombosis']",14962303,"[['D08.811.277.656.675.374.102', 'D09.400.430.500', 'D12.776.395.033'], ['D08.811.277.656.675.374.102.500.813', 'D09.400.430.500.500.813', 'D12.776.395.033.500.813', 'D12.776.860.300.085.813'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374'], ['E02.095.135.750', 'E02.120.770.500', 'E02.912.715.500', 'E04.292.869.500'], ['E02.860'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C14.907.355.830']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
39391,Simulation of arrhythmogenic effect of rogue RyRs in failing heart by using a coupled model.,"Cardiac cells with heart failure are usually characterized by impairment of Ca(2+) handling with smaller SR Ca(2+) store and high risk of triggered activities. In this study, we developed a coupled model by integrating the spatiotemporal Ca(2+) reaction-diffusion system into the cellular electrophysiological model. With the coupled model, the subcellular Ca(2+) dynamics and global cellular electrophysiology could be simultaneously traced. The proposed coupled model was then applied to study the effects of rogue RyRs on Ca(2+) cycling and membrane potential in failing heart. The simulation results suggested that, in the presence of rogue RyRs, Ca(2+) dynamics is unstable and Ca(2+) waves are prone to be initiated spontaneously. These release events would elevate the membrane potential substantially which might induce delayed afterdepolarizations or triggered action potentials. Moreover, the variation of membrane potential depolarization is indicated to be dependent on the distribution density of rogue RyR channels. This study provides a new possible arrhythmogenic mechanism for heart failure from subcellular to cellular level.","['Action Potentials', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac', 'Calcium', 'Computer Simulation', 'Diffusion', 'Electrophysiology', 'Heart Failure', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Models, Statistical', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Muscle Cells', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Time Factors']",23056145,"[['G04.580.100', 'G07.265.675.100', 'G11.561.570.100'], ['C14.280.067', 'C23.550.073'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['L01.224.160'], ['G01.202', 'G02.196'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['C14.280.434'], ['A07.541.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.154.535', 'G04.580', 'G07.265.675', 'G11.561.570'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['E05.599'], ['A11.620'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.800', 'D12.776.210.500.800', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.800', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.800'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
46185,Osmotic water transport with glucose in GLUT2 and SGLT.,"Carrier-mediated water cotransport is currently a favored explanation for water movement against an osmotic gradient. The vestibule within the central pore of Na(+)-dependent cotransporters or GLUT2 provides the necessary precondition for an osmotic mechanism, explaining this phenomenon without carriers. Simulating equilibrative glucose inflow via the narrow external orifice of GLUT2 raises vestibular tonicity relative to the external solution. Vestibular hypertonicity causes osmotic water inflow, which raises vestibular hydrostatic pressure and forces water, salt, and glucose into the outer cytosolic layer via its wide endofacial exit. Glucose uptake via GLUT2 also raises oocyte tonicity. Glucose exit from preloaded cells depletes the vestibule of glucose, making it hypotonic and thereby inducing water efflux. Inhibiting glucose exit with phloretin reestablishes vestibular hypertonicity, as it reequilibrates with the cytosolic glucose and net water inflow recommences. Simulated Na(+)-glucose cotransport demonstrates that active glucose accumulation within the vestibule generates water flows simultaneously with the onset of glucose flow and before any flow external to the transporter caused by hypertonicity in the outer cytosolic layers. The molar ratio of water/glucose flow is seen now to relate to the ratio of hydraulic and glucose permeability rather than to water storage capacity of putative water carriers.","['Computer Simulation', 'Diffusion', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Transporter Type 2', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Pressure', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sodium-Glucose Transport Proteins', 'Water']",18234816,"[['L01.224.160'], ['G01.202', 'G02.196'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D12.776.157.530.500.500.750', 'D12.776.157.530.937.563.750', 'D12.776.543.585.500.500.750', 'D12.776.543.585.937.625.750'], ['E05.599.495'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G01.374.715.578', 'G02.640.249', 'G02.723.661'], ['G01.374.715'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['D12.776.157.530.450.625.437', 'D12.776.157.530.500.750', 'D12.776.543.585.450.625.562', 'D12.776.543.585.500.750'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5249,A proteasome inhibitor confers cardioprotection.,"OBJECTIVE: In several cell types, proteasome inhibitors like carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132) induce the 72 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp72) and exert cell protective effects. However, data in cardiomyocytes are currently lacking.METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effects of MG132 in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. MG132 time- and concentration-dependently induced Hsp72 and Hsp32 at mRNA and protein levels. Although Hsp60 mRNA was induced, Hsp60 protein levels were not altered. MG132 activated p38 MAP kinase already after 0.5 h. Hsp mRNA induction started after 2 h of MG132 treatment. Subsequently, Hsp72 and Hsp32 protein levels were increased after 4 h. SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, concentration-dependently attenuated MG132-induced Hsp72-and Hsp32-elevations (by 59% and 41%, respectively, at 1 microM SB202190). In contrast, herbimycin A, a known inductor of Hsp72 in cardiomyocytes, enhanced the MG132-induced Hsp72 and Hsp32 expression even further: additionally applied 2 microM herbimycin A induced Hsp72 and Hsp32 about 2-fold higher than 1 microM MG132 alone. MG132 (1 microM) decreased the hyperthermia- or hydrogen peroxide-induced release of lactate dehydrogenase by 45% and by 35%, respectively (P<0.05, n=5). MG132 (1 microM) prolonged the spontaneous beating time of cardiomyocytes at 46 degrees C from 5+/-2 min (control hyperthermia) to 28+/-5 min (P<0.05, n=4). Thus, inhibition of the proteasome function by MG132 protects cardiomyocytes against hyperthermic or oxidative injury. This protective effect and Hsp induction were abolished by 1 microM SB202190.CONCLUSION: Proteasome inhibition results in p38 MAP kinase-dependent induction of Hsp72 and Hsp32 and might be a novel cardioprotective modality.","['Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fever', 'HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', 'Imidazoles', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leupeptins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Myocardium', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Papillary Muscles', 'Pyridines', 'Quinones', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rifabutin', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",12062370,"[['B01.050'], ['D02.806.250'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A11.251'], ['D27.505.519.389.745.325'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['C23.888.119.344'], ['D12.776.580.216.375.202'], ['D12.776.580.216'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.410'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.410.500'], ['D03.383.129.308'], ['E05.481'], ['D02.065.589.327', 'D04.345.295'], ['D12.644.456.580'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567', 'D12.644.360.450', 'D12.776.476.450'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['A02.633.580.680', 'A07.541.510.619', 'A07.541.704.750'], ['D03.383.725'], ['D02.806'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D03.633.400.811.650', 'D04.345.295.750.650'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.843', 'D12.644.360.450.835', 'D12.776.476.450.835']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15682,Cannabis (medical marijuana) treatment for motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson disease: an open-label observational study.,"OBJECTIVE: The use of cannabis as a therapeutic agent for various medical conditions has been well documented. However, clinical trials in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) have yielded conflicting results. The aim of the present open-label observational study was to assess the clinical effect of cannabis on motor and non-motor symptoms of PD.METHODS: Twenty-two patients with PD attending the motor disorder clinic of a tertiary medical center in 2011 to 2012 were evaluated at baseline and 30 minutes after smoking cannabis using the following battery: Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, visual analog scale, present pain intensity scale, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, as well as Medical Cannabis Survey National Drug and Alcohol Research Center Questionnaire.RESULTS: Mean (SD) total score on the motor Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale score improved significantly from 33.1 (13.8) at baseline to 23.2 (10.5) after cannabis consumption (t = 5.9; P < 0.001). Analysis of specific motor symptoms revealed significant improvement after treatment in tremor (P < 0.001), rigidity (P = 0.004), and bradykinesia (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: There was also significant improvement of sleep and pain scores. No significant adverse effects of the drug were observed. The study suggests that cannabis might have a place in the therapeutic armamentarium of PD. Larger, controlled studies are needed to verify the results.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypokinesia', 'Male', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Rigidity', 'Pain Measurement', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sleep', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tremor']",24614667,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.597.350.400', 'C23.888.592.350.400'], ['D26.528'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05.651.504', 'C10.597.613.550.500', 'C23.888.592.608.550.500'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['C10.228.140.079.862.500', 'C10.228.662.600.400', 'C10.574.928.750'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['F02.830.855', 'G11.561.803'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['C10.597.350.850', 'C23.888.592.350.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

45955,Creating visual differences: Methamphetamine users perceptions of anti-meth campaigns.,"BACKGROUND: Because of increased law enforcement and subsequent media attention, methamphetamine users appear in the public's imagination as diseased, zombie-like White trash. We explore methamphetamine users' perceptions about whether the images, people, and situations in anti-methamphetamine campaigns reflect their own lives and experiences using meth.METHODS: To explore these perceptions, we used photo-elicitation interviews with 47 people who used methamphetamine (30 former and 17 active). Specifically, we presented participants with images from the Faces of Meth and the Montana Meth Project campaigns to stimulate discussion.RESULTS: We found that participants believed these ads did not reflect their personal experiences and consequently were ineffective at curtailing their own methamphetamine use. They believed that the ads represented a certain type of methamphetamine user, particularly those they defined as dysfunctional users. They created symbolic boundaries between themselves and those portrayed in the ads to show how they differed, which allowed them to believe that the ads were not relevant to their experiences.CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that there are unintended consequences to inauthentic/dramatic imagery. Participants did not believe they were like those in the ads-thus saw no reason to quit or seek help. Consequently, overly stigmatizing portraits of users may act as barriers to desistence. The findings have implications for designing anti-methamphetamine campaigns.","['Adult', 'Advertising', 'Drug Users', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methamphetamine', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",27768994,"[['M01.060.116'], ['J01.219.687.274', 'L01.143.050'], ['M01.169'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.092.471.683.152.619'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
38757,Risk factors for protracted postoperative length of stay after lower extremity bypass for critical limb ischemia.,"BACKGROUND: Compared with other common chronic conditions, admissions for management of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are associated with prolonged hospitalizations. Length of stay (LOS) is one of many metrics receiving increased attention in the current focus on efficient healthcare delivery. Our objective was to characterize LOS among patients with severe PAD, those undergoing surgical bypass for critical limb ischemia (CLI), and identify risk factors for protracted postoperative LOS.METHODS: Patient data from the 2007 to 2009 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were used to develop a database consisting of patients undergoing bypass surgery for CLI (n = 4,894). Protracted postoperative LOS was defined as the top quartile of days hospitalized from surgery to discharge. Preoperative risk factors with significant association (Pearson chi-squared test; P < 0.05) were used to develop a logistic regression model for protracted postoperative LOS.RESULTS: Average postoperative LOS was 7.5 days (median 6 days). The top quartile of postoperative LOS, >8 days, was used to define protracted LOS. Independent preoperative risk factors for protracted postoperative LOS included demographic characteristics (advanced age and non-Caucasian race), comorbidities, and medical history (e.g., obesity, dialysis dependence, severe cardiac and pulmonary disease, and bleeding disorders). Indicators of PAD severity (e.g., distal target sites, open wounds or gangrene, and prior arterial surgery) were also independent predictors of protracted LOS after surgery. The greatest predictors of extended postoperative LOS were prolonged preoperative hospitalization (OR 2.2 [95% CI: 1.8-2.6], P < 0.001) and preoperative dependent functional status (OR 2.0 [95% CI: 1.7-2.3], P < 0.001 for partial dependence; OR 2.8 [95% CI: 1.8-4.3], P < 0.001 for totally dependent status), where OR and CI stand for odds ratio and confidence interval.CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identify preoperative risk factors for protracted postoperative LOS after infrainguinal bypass for CLI. These findings provide an important evidence basis for ongoing efforts to reduce healthcare spending and facilitate provision of efficient health care. Future efforts will include prospective identification of patients at high risk for protracted postoperative LOS and targeted multidisciplinary efforts to reduce associated costs without sacrificing healthcare quality.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Critical Illness', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ischemia', 'Length of Stay', 'Logistic Models', 'Lower Extremity', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Discharge', 'Peripheral Arterial Disease', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'Vascular Grafting']",24517986,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['C23.550.291.625'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400', 'L01.470.750.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.513'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['A01.378.610'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['E02.760.169.125', 'E02.760.400.610', 'N02.421.585.169.125', 'N02.421.585.400.610', 'N04.590.233.727.210.125'], ['C14.907.137.126.307.500', 'C14.907.617.671'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['E04.100.814.868']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

In a specifically designed, shielded experimental chamber, the circularly polarized electromagnetic field applied was transmitted by an antenna positioned 10 cm behind the head of upright sitting test persons. The carrier frequency of 900 MHz was pulsed with 217 Hz (average power flux density 1 W/m2). In double blind trials, each test person underwent a total of 20 randomly allotted 4 hour periods of exposure and sham exposure, equally distributed at day and night.

35871,Assay Conditions Influence Affinities of Rat Organic Cation Transporter 1: Analysis of Mutagenesis in the Modeled Outward-Facing Cleft by Measuring Effects of Substrates and Inhibitors on Initial Uptake.,"The effects of mutations in the modeled outward-open cleft of rat organic cation transporter 1 (rOCT1) on affinities of substrates and inhibitors were investigated. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were stably transfected with rOCT1 or rOCT1 mutants, and uptake of the substrates 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium+ (MPP+) and tetraethylammonium+ (TEA+) or inhibition of MPP+ uptake by the nontransported inhibitors tetrabutylammonium+ (TBuA+), tetrapentylammonium+ (TPeA+), and corticosterone was measured. Uptake measurements were performed on confluent cell layers using a 2-minute incubation or in dissociated cells using incubation times of 1, 5, or 10 seconds. With both methods, different apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) values, different IC50 values, and varying effects of mutations were determined. In addition, varying IC50 values for the inhibition of MPP+ uptake and varying effects of mutations were obtained when different MPP+ concentrations far below the apparent Km value were used for uptake measurements. Eleven mutations were investigated by measuring initial uptake in dissociated cells and employing 0.1 µM MPP+ for uptake during inhibition experiments. Altered affinities for substrates and/or inhibitors were observed when Phe160, Trp218, Arg440, Leu447, and Asp475 were mutated. The mutations resulted in changes of apparent Km values for TEA+ and/or MPP+ Mutation of Trp218 and Asp475 led to altered IC50 values for TBuA+, TPeA+, and corticosterone, whereas the mutation of Phe160 and Leu447 changed the IC50 values for two inhibitors. Thereby amino acids in the outward-facing conformation of rOCT1 could be identified that interact with structurally different inhibitors and probably also with different substrates.","['1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium', 'Animals', 'Catecholamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds', 'Rats', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Xenopus laevis']",29339398,"[['D03.383.725.762.550'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.157.530.562.374.500', 'D12.776.543.585.562.374.500'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G05.558'], ['D01.625.062.500', 'D02.092.877', 'D02.675.276'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['G02.111.835'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.610.500.562']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3760,Recurrent Granulibacter bethesdensis infections and chronic granulomatous disease.,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by frequent infections, most of which are curable. Granulibacter bethesdensis is an emerging pathogen in patients with CGD that causes fever and necrotizing lymphadenitis. However, unlike typical CGD organisms, this organism can cause relapse after clinical quiescence. To better define whether infections were newly acquired or recrudesced, we use comparative bacterial genomic hybridization to characterize 11 isolates obtained from 5 patients with CGD from North and Central America. Genomic typing showed that 3 patients had recurrent infection months to years after apparent clinical cure.

24690,PPAR Agonists: II. Fenofibrate and Tesaglitazar Alter Behaviors Related to Voluntary Alcohol Consumption.,"BACKGROUND: In the accompanying article, we showed that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARá) signaling by fenofibrate and tesaglitazar decreases ethanol (EtOH) consumption in mice. In this study, we determined the role of these PPAR agonists in EtOH-related behaviors and other actions that may be important in regulating EtOH consumption.METHODS: The effects of fenofibrate (150 mg/kg) and tesaglitazar (1.5 mg/kg) were examined on the following responses in male and female C57BL/6J (B6) and B6 ? 129S4 mice: preference for saccharin, EtOH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), conditioned taste aversion (CTA), loss of righting reflex, and withdrawal, acoustic startle reflex, response to novelty, and EtOH clearance. Because the B6 inbred strain usually displays weak EtOH-induced CPP and weak EtOH-induced acute withdrawal, B6 ? 129S4 mice were also studied.RESULTS: Fenofibrate and tesaglitazar decreased the novelty response and increased acute EtOH withdrawal severity, and fenofibrate increased EtOH-induced CTA. Two important factors for EtOH consumption (saccharin preference and EtOH-induced CPP) were not altered by fenofibrate or tesaglitazar. EtOH clearance was increased by both fenofibrate and tesaglitazar. Response to novelty, acute withdrawal, and EtOH clearance show sex differences and could contribute to the reduced EtOH consumption following fenofibrate administration.CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate the complexity of EtOH-dependent and EtOH-independent behaviors that are altered by PPAR agonists and provide evidence for novel behavioral actions of these drugs that may contribute to PPAR-mediated effects on alcohol drinking.","['Alcohol Drinking', 'Alkanesulfonates', 'Animals', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Conditioning, Classical', 'Female', 'Fenofibrate', 'Locomotion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'PPAR alpha', 'Phenylpropionates', 'Reflex, Righting', 'Taste']",26857541,"[['F01.145.317.269'], ['D02.455.326.146.100.050', 'D02.886.645.600.055.050'], ['B01.050'], ['F02.463.425.097', 'F02.463.785.373.173'], ['F02.463.425.179.308'], ['D02.241.081.114.968.500.625', 'D02.355.726.305.625', 'D02.455.426.559.389.134.750', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.654.305.625', 'D02.522.223.750'], ['G07.568.500', 'G11.427.410.568'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.025', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.025', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500.025'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['D12.776.826.239.500'], ['D02.241.223.701'], ['E01.370.376.550.650.695', 'E01.370.600.550.650.695', 'G07.888.875', 'G11.561.731.745'], ['F02.830.816.724', 'G11.561.790.724']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24078,A novel method for amino starch preparation and its adsorption for Cu(II) and Cr(VI).,"A novel method was proposed to prepare amino starch by reacting ethylenediamine with previously synthesized dialdehyde starch. Different factors affecting the preparation, i.e., ethylenediamine concentration, ethylenediamine:dialdehyde starch molar ratio, pH, duration and temperature have been studied. The modified starch was characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The amino starch derivatives were evaluated as adsorbents. The adsorption activity for heavy metals such as Cu(II) and Cr(VI) by crosslinked amino starch was studied in terms of adsorption amount, kinetics and isotherm; and adsorbent reuse were also studied. Adsorption processes for Cu(II) and Cr(VI) on crosslinked amino starch fit a Langmuir isotherm, and adsorption for Cu(II) and Cr(VI) from aqueous solution was endothermic reactions. Crosslinked amino starch was very effective for the adsorption of Cu(II) and Cr(VI), and efficient in capacity, recycled.","['Adsorption', 'Amines', 'Chromium', 'Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Copper', 'Ethylenediamines', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Methods', 'Starch', 'Thermodynamics']",20605326,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['D02.092'], ['D01.268.556.175', 'D01.268.956.124', 'D01.552.544.175'], ['J01.256', 'N06.230.080'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['D02.092.782.258.368'], ['D01.268.556', 'D01.552.544'], ['E05.581'], ['D05.750.078.562.855', 'D09.301.915', 'D09.698.365.855'], ['G01.906']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
40142,Interactions between the oocyte and cumulus cells in the ovary of the B6.Y(TIR) sex-reversed female mouse.,"The XY (B6.Y(TIR)) sex-reversed female mouse is infertile, primarily because of the early death of its embryos. We have previously determined that the XY oocyte itself, not the surrounding somatic cells, is responsible for its failure in postfertilization development. In the present study, we assessed the ability of the XY oocyte to regulate granulosa cell differentiation and functions. Oocyte-cumulus complexes (OCC) were isolated from antral follicles and were cultured in the presence of FSH and testosterone. Microsurgical removal of oocytes prevented cumulus cell expansion and suppressed estradiol production while it promoted progesterone production. Coculture with denuded oocytes from either XX or XY ovaries restored cumulus expansion and the endocrine profile observed in intact OCC. Morphology of oocytes and OCC in the preantral and antral follicles in situ as well as after isolation was compared for XX and XY ovaries. The average area of XY oocytes was smaller by 20% only at the preantral stage, whereas the zona pellucida layer was thinner by 20% at all stages. Furthermore, the XY oocyte was found to be attached to fewer cumulus cells (60% of XX control) in antral follicles and isolated OCC. In conclusion, the XY oocyte develops the normal ability of regulating granulosa cell differentiation despite its inferiority with respect to some morphometric parameters when compared to the XX oocyte.","['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chimera', 'Disorders of Sex Development', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Granulosa Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Oocytes', 'Ovary', 'Progesterone', 'Sex Differentiation', 'Y Chromosome']",9283002,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.085'], ['G04.152'], ['B05.200'], ['C12.706.316', 'C13.351.875.253', 'C16.131.939.316', 'C19.391.119'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['G05.380'], ['A05.360.319.114.630.535.200', 'A06.300.312.497.535.300', 'A11.382.812', 'A11.436.329'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['A05.360.490.690.680', 'A11.497.497.600'], ['A05.360.319.114.630', 'A05.360.576.497', 'A06.300.312.497'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829', 'D06.472.334.734.623', 'D06.472.334.851.687.750'], ['G07.345.500.325.377.843', 'G07.345.750.500', 'G08.686.841.500'], ['A11.284.187.865.983', 'G05.360.162.865.983']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33932,"DTS-108, a novel peptidic prodrug of SN38: in vivo efficacy and toxicokinetic studies.","PURPOSE: Irinotecan is a prodrug converted to the active cytotoxic molecule SN38 predominantly by the action of liver carboxylesterases. The efficacy of irinotecan is limited by this hepatic activation that results in a low conversion rate, high interpatient variability, and dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel peptidic prodrug of SN38 (DTS-108) developed to bypass this hepatic activation and thus reduce the gastrointestinal toxicity and interpatient variability compared with irinotecan.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: SN38 was conjugated to a cationic peptide (Vectocell) via an esterase cleavable linker. The preclinical development plan consisted of toxicity and efficacy evaluation in a number of different models and species.RESULTS: The conjugate (DTS-108) is highly soluble, with a human plasma half-life of 400 minutes in vitro. Studies in the dog showed that DTS-108 liberates significantly higher levels of free SN38 than irinotecan without causing gastrointestinal toxicity. In addition, the ratio of the inactive SN38-glucuronide metabolite compared with the active SN38 metabolite is significantly lower following DTS-108 administration, compared with irinotecan, which is consistent with reduced hepatic metabolism. In vivo efficacy studies showed that DTS-108 has improved activity compared with irinotecan. A significant dose-dependent antitumoral efficacy was observed in all models tested and DTS-108 showed synergistic effects in combination with other clinically relevant therapeutic agents.CONCLUSIONS: DTS-108 is able to deliver significantly higher levels of SN38 than irinotecan, without the associated toxicity of irinotecan, resulting in an increased therapeutic window for DTS-108 in preclinical models. These encouraging data merit further preclinical and clinical investigation.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Camptothecin', 'Cations', 'Dogs', 'Drug Carriers', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Peptides', 'Prodrugs', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",18381956,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248.179'], ['D03.132.151'], ['D01.248.497.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['D26.255.260', 'E02.319.300.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.132.151.425'], ['C04.619', 'E05.598.500.496'], ['D12.644'], ['D26.675'], ['E05.337.550.200.900', 'E05.624.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
10754,A novel ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase from the hydrogen-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacterium Hydrogenobacter thermophilus TK-6.,"Glutamate synthases are classified according to their specificities for electron donors. Ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthases had been found only in plants and cyanobacteria, whereas many bacteria have NADPH-dependent glutamate synthases. In this study, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus, a hydrogen-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacterium, was shown to possess a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase like those of phototrophs. This is the first observation, to our knowledge, of a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase in a nonphotosynthetic organism. The purified enzyme from H. thermophilus was shown to be a monomer of a 168-kDa polypeptide homologous to ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthases from phototrophs. In contrast to known ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthases, the H. thermophilus glutamate synthase exhibited glutaminase activity. Furthermore, this glutamate synthase did not react with a plant-type ferredoxin (Fd3 from this bacterium) containing a [2Fe-2S] cluster but did react with bacterial ferredoxins (Fd1 and Fd2 from this bacterium) containing [4Fe-4S] clusters. Interestingly, the H. thermophilus glutamate synthase was activated by some of the organic acids in the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, the central carbon metabolic pathway of this organism. This type of activation has not been reported for any other glutamate synthases, and this property may enable the control of nitrogen assimilation by carbon metabolism.","['Bacteria', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'DNA Primers', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Ferredoxins', 'Glutamate Synthase', 'Hydrogen', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Spectrophotometry']",17237175,"[['B03'], ['D12.776.097'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['E05.196.867.519.274'], ['D12.776.097.350', 'D12.776.157.427.374.375.275', 'D12.776.556.579.374.375.275', 'D12.776.765.319'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.470', 'D08.811.913.477.700.470'], ['D01.268.406', 'D01.362.340'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['D12.776.828'], ['E05.196.712.726', 'E05.196.867.826']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
9275,Lenvatinib versus sorafenib in first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial.,"BACKGROUND: In a phase 2 trial, lenvatinib, an inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1-3, FGF receptors 1-4, PDGF receptor á, RET, and KIT, showed activity in hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to compare overall survival in patients treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.METHODS: This was an open-label, phase 3, multicentre, non-inferiority trial that recruited patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, who had not received treatment for advanced disease, at 154 sites in 20 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific, European, and North American regions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice-web response system-with region; macroscopic portal vein invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; and bodyweight as stratification factors-to receive oral lenvatinib (12 mg/day for bodyweight ?60 kg or 8 mg/day for bodyweight <60 kg) or sorafenib 400 mg twice-daily in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured from the date of randomisation until the date of death from any cause. The efficacy analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle, and only patients who received treatment were included in the safety analysis. The non-inferiority margin was set at 1·08. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01761266.FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2013 and July 30, 2015, 1492 patients were recruited. 954 eligible patients were randomly assigned to lenvatinib (n=478) or sorafenib (n=476). Median survival time for lenvatinib of 13·6 months (95% CI 12·1-14·9) was non-inferior to sorafenib (12·3 months, 10·4-13·9; hazard ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·06), meeting criteria for non-inferiority. The most common any-grade adverse events were hypertension (201 [42%]), diarrhoea (184 [39%]), decreased appetite (162 [34%]), and decreased weight (147 [31%]) for lenvatinib, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (249 [52%]), diarrhoea (220 [46%]), hypertension (144 [30%]), and decreased appetite (127 [27%]) for sorafenib.INTERPRETATION: Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The safety and tolerability profiles of lenvatinib were consistent with those previously observed.FUNDING: Eisai Inc.","['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Niacinamide', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Quinolines', 'Sorafenib', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",29433850,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.066.515.530', 'D03.383.725.547.530'], ['D02.065.950.681', 'D02.455.426.559.389.703'], ['D03.633.100.810'], ['D02.065.950.681.757', 'D02.455.426.559.389.703.757', 'D03.066.515.530.750', 'D03.383.725.547.530.750'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
38914,Lower-body determinants of running economy in male and female distance runners.,"A variety of training approaches have been shown to improve running economy in well-trained athletes. However, there is a paucity of data exploring lower-body determinants that may affect running economy and account for differences that may exist between genders. Sixty-three male and female distance runners were assessed in the laboratory for a range of metabolic, biomechanical, and neuromuscular measures potentially related to running economy (ml·kg(-1)·min(-1)) at a range of running speeds. At all common test velocities, women were more economical than men (effect size [ES] = 0.40); however, when compared in terms of relative intensity, men had better running economy (ES = 2.41). Leg stiffness (r = -0.80) and moment arm length (r = 0.90) were large-extremely largely correlated with running economy and each other (r = -0.82). Correlations between running economy and kinetic measures (peak force, peak power, and time to peak force) for both genders were unclear. The relationship in stride rate (r = -0.27 to -0.31) was in the opposite direction to that of stride length (r = 0.32-0.49), and the relationship in contact time (r = -0.21 to -0.54) was opposite of that of flight time (r = 0.06-0.74). Although both leg stiffness and moment arm length are highly related to running economy, it seems that no single lower-body measure can completely explain differences in running economy between individuals or genders. Running economy is therefore likely determined from the sum of influences from multiple lower-body attributes.","['Achilles Tendon', 'Adolescent', 'Arm', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Gait', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leg', 'Male', 'Movement', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Running', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",24126900,"[['A02.880.176'], ['M01.060.057'], ['A01.378.800.075'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['E01.370.600.250', 'G11.427.410.568.900.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A01.378.610.500'], ['G07.568', 'G11.427.410'], ['G03.680'], ['G11.427.410.568.610', 'G11.427.410.698.277.750', 'I03.350.750', 'I03.450.642.845.610'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
45558,Common variation at 6q16 within HACE1 and LIN28B influences susceptibility to neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for approximately 10% of all pediatric oncology deaths. Here, we report a genome-wide association study of 2,817 neuroblastoma cases and 7,473 controls. We identified two new associations at 6q16, the first within HACE1 (rs4336470; combined P=2.7?10(-11); odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.35) and the second within LIN28B (rs17065417; combined P=1.2?10(-8); odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.23-1.54). Expression of LIN28B and let-7 miRNA correlated with rs17065417 genotype in neuroblastoma cell lines, and we observed significant growth inhibition upon depletion of LIN28B, specifically in neuroblastoma cells that were homozygous for the risk allele. Low HACE1 and high LIN28B expression in diagnostic primary neuroblastomas were associated with worse overall survival (P=0.008 and 0.014, respectively). Taken together, these data show that common variants in HACE1 and LIN28B influence neuroblastoma susceptibility and indicate that both genes likely have a role in disease progression.","['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcriptome', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",22941191,"[['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.325.330', 'G05.360.162.520.300.325.330'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.330'], ['E05.393.335.500'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['E05.318.370.392', 'E05.318.416.249', 'E05.393.385.500', 'E05.393.522.500', 'E05.393.760.640.500', 'N06.850.520.445.392', 'N06.850.520.470.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['G05.348.500'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.590.650.550', 'C04.557.470.670.590.650.550', 'C04.557.580.625.600.590.650.550'], ['E05.393.661.640', 'E05.393.760.640', 'E05.588.570.660', 'E05.601.640'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['D12.776.157.725', 'D12.776.664.962'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['G02.111.873.750', 'G05.297.700.750', 'G05.360.920'], ['D08.811.464.938.750']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
11523,"Victimization, Suicidal Ideation, and Alcohol Use From Age 13 to 15 Years: Support for the Self-Medication Model.","PURPOSE: Recent years have seen increased coverage of adolescent victimization and suicide. Both adolescent peer victimization and substance use have been associated with suicidal ideation, with evidence suggesting that all three factors are interrelated. There are at least four models which can explain the associations between these factors (i.e., self-medication, secondary mental disorder, bidirectional, and common factor). However, none of them is being empirically supported as the dominant model because few longitudinal studies have explored the association between these factors.METHODS: The present study compared longitudinal paths of all four models simultaneously using a cross-lagged model. This was done using self-reported measures of peer victimization, suicidal ideation, and alcohol use at age 13, 14, and 15 years in a longitudinal sample of 238 adolescents.RESULTS: All three variables were moderately stable across time. Significant cross-lagged associations were found, showing that frequent peer victimization at age 13 years was associated with higher odds of having suicidal ideation at age 14 years (odds ratio, 1.82; p < .05). In turn, presence of suicidal ideation at age 14 years was significantly associated with higher alcohol use frequency at age 15 years (â = .13; p < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Results support previous literature suggesting that peer victimization predates alcohol use and extends it by showing clear directionality between suicidal ideation and alcohol use over 1 year, supporting the self-medication model. Clarifying the empirical basis of these underlying models could allow for earlier prevention strategies, by targeting the risk factor that appears the earliest in the model.","['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Bullying', 'Crime Victims', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Models, Psychological', 'Peer Group', 'Quebec', 'Self Medication', 'Self Report', 'Suicidal Ideation']",27914973,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.145.022'], ['F01.145.317.269'], ['F01.145.126.125.550', 'F01.145.813.213.500', 'I01.880.735.070'], ['M01.135'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['E05.599.695'], ['F01.829.316.483'], ['Z01.107.567.176.791'], ['E02.319.900', 'E02.900.900'], ['E05.318.308.980.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.500'], ['F01.145.126.980.875.149', 'I01.880.735.856.149']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
27253,Study of human epithelial cell detachment and damage: development of a model.,"Detachment of epithelial structures from underlying basement membrane (BM) represents an important component of a number of human disease processes e.g. airway and alveolar diseases, gastrointestinal ulceration, and retinal diseases. This study describes a method of evaluating human epithelial cell detachment from BM that is simple, rapid, inexpensive, quantifiable and which, because it utilizes BM rather than tissue culture plastic, more closely mimics the in vivo situation than other methods. In this model human amnionic epithelial cells attached to their underlying BM are isolated from fresh placentae and mounted in a multi-well chemotaxis assembly. These membranes can be studied with the epithelial cell monolayer intact. Protease-induced detachment of the epithelial cells from the underlying BM was readily quantifiable using light microscopy and spectroscopy. Following removal of the native amnionic epithelial cells, immunoperoxidase staining for the BM attachment proteins laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen demonstrated that these molecules remain intact. The BM could also be used as an attachment surface to reconstitute other epithelial cell monolayers. Cultured human amnionic cells and human respiratory epithelial cells were both able to attach to the denuded BM in the absence of serum (% attachment = 85 +/- 15% and 92 +/- 8% respectively, P = 0.8). Natural BM was a better substrate for epithelial cell attachment than tissue culture plastic in that, in the absence of serum, cultured epithelial cell attachment to tissue culture plastic was 20 +/- 4% of the value for BM (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, cells attached to plastic adhered less effectively than to BM in that trypsin concentrations required to induce 50% cell detachment were 0.72 +/- 0.4 for plastic and 62 +/- 13 BAEE U/ml for BM (P less than 0.001). In view of the complex protein interactions known to be involved in the anchorage of human epithelial cells to BM, it is likely this model will be a useful tool for evaluating the mechanisms underlying human epithelial cell attachment and detachment in a variety of normal and disease situations.","['Amnion', 'Basement Membrane', 'Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen', 'Epithelial Attachment', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Extraembryonic Membranes', 'Fibronectins', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Laminin', 'Models, Biological', 'Periodontium', 'Spectrophotometry']",2696726,"[['A10.615.284.277', 'A16.254.750.277'], ['A10.272.220', 'A10.615.179'], ['E01.370.225.500.195', 'E05.200.500.195', 'E05.242.195', 'G04.140'], ['A11.251'], ['D05.750.078.280', 'D12.776.860.300.250'], ['A14.549.167.646.374'], ['A11.436'], ['A10.272'], ['A10.615.284', 'A16.254.750'], ['D12.776.377.715.390', 'D12.776.395.550.350', 'D12.776.543.550.350', 'D12.776.860.300.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.350', 'E05.478.583.400', 'E05.601.470.350'], ['D12.776.395.550.530', 'D12.776.543.550.500', 'D12.776.860.300.675'], ['E05.599.395'], ['A14.549.167.646'], ['E05.196.712.726', 'E05.196.867.826']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33453,Mechanism of action of cholera toxin and the mobile receptor theory of hormone receptor-adenylate cyclase interactions.,"Rat liver membrane adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) that has been stimulated more than 10-fold by cholera toxin (choleragen) has a 3-fold greater sensitivity to stimulation by glucagon. Choleragen similarly increases the sensitivity of cyclase to other peptide (ACTH, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) and nonpeptide (catecholamines) hormones in this and other tissues. The rate of 125I-labeled glucagon-membrane dissociation is decreased about 2-fold in toxin-treated liver membranes. Toxin-activated cyclase activity of fat cell membranes is retained upon solubilization with Lubrol PX. Provided 125I-labeled choleragen is first incubated with cells under conditions resulting in enzyme activation, the solubilized cyclase activity migrates with a component of 125I-labeled choleragen on gel filtration chromatography. Agarose derivatives containing the ""active"" subunit (molecular weight 36,000) of the toxin can specifically adsorb solubilized adenylate cyclase. Toxin-stimulated cyclase can be immunoprecipitated with antitoxin or anti-""active"" subunit antibodies. There is a large excess of membrane receptors (ganglioside GM1) which, with the use of choleragenoid, can be shown to be functionally equivalent with respect to cyclase activation. Choleragenoid, an inactive competitive antagonist of toxin binding, can occupy and block a large proportion of toxin receptors without affecting toxin activity. A scheme of toxin action is proposed that involves lateral membrane diffusion of the initially inactive toxin-receptor complex with subsequent direct interaction with and modulation of adenylate cyclase. The basic features of this scheme may be pertinent to the mechanisms by which hormone receptors normally modulate adenylate cyclase.","['Adenylyl Cyclases', 'Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gangliosides', 'Glucagon', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Liver', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Toxins, Biological', 'Vibrio cholerae']",164020,"[['D08.811.520.650.200', 'D12.644.360.050', 'D12.776.476.050'], ['A10.165.114'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.284.149'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D09.400.410.420.025.475', 'D10.390.470.025.475', 'D10.570.877.360.025.475'], ['D06.472.699.587.730.500', 'D12.644.548.586.730.500'], ['D01.268.380.400.500.496', 'D01.496.448.496', 'D01.496.749.474'], ['A03.620'], ['E05.599.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['D23.946'], ['B03.440.450.900.859.225', 'B03.660.250.830.830.100']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
19840,Influence of CPITN partial recordings on estimates of prevalence and severity of various periodontal conditions in adults.,"This study compares the results of a full mouth examination with the results of examining only the CPITN selection of 10 index teeth 17/16, 11, 26/27, 47/46, 31 and 36/37 for estimates of prevalence and severity of the conditions assessed with the CPITN, i.e. gingival bleeding, dental calculus, pockets 4-5 mm deep and pockets 6+ mm deep. The mean number of sextants recorded with bleeding or with calculus was generally overestimated when examinations were based on the CPITN selection of index teeth, whereas the mean number of sextants with pockets, whether moderate or deep, were generally underestimated. Similarly, the prevalence of pockets, whether moderate or deep, was underestimated in virtually all age groups while the prevalence of calculus was overestimated in all age groups and the prevalence of bleeding was overestimated among persons below 30 yr of age. We conclude that the partial recording approach of the CPITN methodology is reasonably well suited for identifying persons who are relatively healthy according to the hierarchy of the CPITN parameters. There is, however, a considerable risk that persons presenting with the more severe conditions, i.e. pockets, will be overlooked if only partial recordings are performed.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Dental Calculus', 'Gingival Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Kenya', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Periodontal Index', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility of Results']",8306612,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C07.793.208.250', 'C23.300.175.350'], ['C07.465.625.446', 'C07.465.714.258.250', 'C23.550.414.922.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.058.290.120.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['C07.465.714'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.300.725', 'E06.208.720', 'E06.721.658', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.300.690', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.300.725', 'N06.890.160.215'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Racemic 6 and 11 did not substitute in (S)-amphetamine-trained rats. All of the test compounds were potent inhibitors of [3H]-5-HT uptake into synaptosomes in vitro, with the S enantiomer of 6 being most active. Rat brain monoamine levels were unaltered 1 week following a single high dose (10 or 20 mg/kg, sc) of 6 or 11, or two weeks following a subacute dosing regimen (20 mg/kg, sc, twice a day for 4 days). In addition, radioligand-binding parameters in rat brain homogenate with the 5-HT uptake inhibitor [3H]paroxetine were unchanged after subacute dosing with either racemic 6 or 11.

43484,Bilateral childhood visual impairment: child and parent concerns.,"PURPOSE: To identify specific health-related quality of life and visual function concerns affecting children with bilateral visual impairment as expressed by children or one of their parents (proxy) and concerns affecting the parents themselves.METHODS: A total of 37 children <16 years of age with visual impairment (visual acuity worse than 20/70 in the better eye) and one parent for each child were prospectively enrolled. Semistructured individual interviews were performed with children 5-15 years of age (n = 16) and with one parent for each child (ages 0-15 years, N = 37). Interview transcripts were analyzed using NVivo software. Categories of concern were identified from both child and parent interviews, from which broad themes were identified. The frequencies of the themes and specific categories of concerns were calculated.RESULTS: Regarding the child's experience, categories of concern were grouped into 6 themes: visual function (expressed by 13 of 16 children [81%] and 33 of 37 parents [89%]), treatment (63% and 54%), emotions (50% and 68%), social (50% and 70%), physical discomfort (50% and 22%), and worry (38% and 8%).

Mental retardation represents the highest proportion of subjects followed by Down's syndrome and then Autism Male subjects were found to consume higher nutrients than females at all ages except age under seven years. The intake of both gender was less than the recommended for energy, calcium, vitamin A, niacin and zinc. While the intake of protein and vitamin C was more than the RDA Iron intake was below the recommended for females at all ages and within the acceptable level for male. The results also showed that there is a relationship between nutrient intake and disability type. Down syndrome children were found to consume more nutrients than mentally retarded and autistic subjects.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Disabled Children', 'Egypt', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional Status', 'Urban Population']",16918148,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.150.200'], ['Z01.058.266.317'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.585', 'N05.715.360.300.560', 'N06.850.505.557', 'N06.850.520.308.585'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['N01.600.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
37873,Non-heparin hemodialysis with oral administration of newly developed antiplatelet agent.,"Non-heparin hemodialysis (HD) was successfully done in anuric dogs with the oral administration of a newly developed antiplatelet agent, 4-cyano-5,5-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-pentenoic acid, (E5510, Eisai Pharmaceutical Co., Japan). In the current study, the antithrombotic effect of E5510 during HD was investigated. Eleven mongrel dogs with bilateral ureteral ligation were given 0.1 mg/kg of E5510 orally 1 hr before undergoing 4 hr HD using hollow fiber dialyzers, (PMMA 5, regenerated cellulose 6) without heparin and under general anesthesia. Blood samples were taken before the administration of E5510 and before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after starting HD; blood counts, hematocrits, blood chemistries, and plasma thromboxane levels (TxB2) were examined. Platelet aggregation, activated clotting times (ACT), and activated partial thrombin times (APTT) were also measured, and sequential plasma E5510 concentrations were determined. In 10 of 11 anuric dogs, non-heparin HD was successfully done with minimal clotting in the dialyzer and drip chambers. The maximum aggregation rate was depressed to less than 20% of the initial value throughout HD. Plasma TxB2 concentration was depressed, and ACT and APTT were mildly, but not significantly prolonged. Neither hemorrhagic complications nor other side effects of E5510 were observed.","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated', 'Heparin', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Kidneys, Artificial', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors', 'Renal Dialysis']",2252660,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['D10.251.355.325'], ['D09.698.373.400'], ['C12.777.419.780.750.500', 'C13.351.968.419.780.750.500'], ['E07.858.082.585'], ['D27.505.954.502.780'], ['E02.870.300', 'E02.912.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3762,Serum microRNA-21 predicted treatment outcome and survival in HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of ser-miRNAs at different periods during treatment and analyze their relationship with therapeutic response and prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab (NCCT).METHODS: Venous blood was drawn from patients at different periods during NCCT. The expression of ser-miRNAs was assessed by qRT-PCR and their relation to treatment response and survival was analyzed.RESULTS: The results showed the expression of miR-10b, -21, -34a, -125b, -145, -155, and -373 in patients before the start of treatment was significantly higher, ser-miR-210 was lower, and ser-miR-122 was comparable to the levels in healthy controls. Changes in ser-miR-21 levels during NCCT were significantly correlated to clinical response and survival and, however, were not associated with pathology response. The expression levels of ser-miR-21 were decreased from the start of NCCT to the end of the second cycle and from the start to the end of NCCT in clinical responders; however, there was no significant difference in non-responders. The patients with decreased ser-miR-21 expression from the start to the end of the second cycle and from the start to the end of NCCT had better overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than those with elevated ser-miR-21 expression.CONCLUSION: These results showed that changes in ser-miR-21 levels were significantly related to NCCT clinical response and prognosis. Ser-miR-21 may serve as a non-invasive biomarker to predict NCCT response in HER2-positive breast cancer.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Survival Rate', 'Trastuzumab', 'Treatment Outcome']",31482230,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.248.384'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D13.150.650.319', 'D13.444.735.150.319', 'D13.444.735.790.552.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.186.450'], ['E01.789'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074.400', 'D12.776.624.664.700.642', 'D23.050.301.500.600.700', 'D23.050.705.552.600.550', 'D23.101.140.642'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.060.875', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.060.875', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.200.875'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
11534,Gait pattern differences in children with unilateral cerebral palsy.,"Children with cerebral palsy (CP) often have atypical body posture patterns and abnormal gait patterns resulting from functional strategies to compensate for primary anomalies that are directly attributable to damage to the central nervous system. Our previous study revealed two different postural patterns in children with unilateral CP: (1) a pattern with overloading of the affected body side and (2) a pattern with under-loading of the affected side. The purpose of present study was to test whether different gait patterns dependent on weight distribution between the affected and unaffected body sides could be detected in these children. The study included 45 outpatients with unilateral CP and 51 children with mild scoliosis (reference group). The examination consisted of two inter-related parts: paedobarographic measurements of the body mass distribution between the body sides and three-dimensional instrumented gait analysis. Using cluster analysis based on the Gillette Gait Index (GGI) values, three gait patterns were described: a scoliotic gait pattern and two hemiplegic gait patterns, corresponding to overloading/under-loading of the hemi-side, which are the pro-gravitational gait pattern (PGP) and the anti-gravitational gait pattern (AGP), respectively. The results of this study showed that subjects with AGP presented a higher degree of deviation from the normal gait than children with PGP. This proof that there are differences in the GGI between the AGP and PGP could be a starting point to identify kinematic differences between these gaits in a follow-up study.","['Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Hemiplegia', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Scoliosis', 'Weight-Bearing']",24946266,"[['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C10.228.140.140.254'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['C10.597.404', 'C23.888.592.413'], ['C10.597.622.295', 'C23.888.592.636.312'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C05.116.900.800.875'], ['G01.374.965']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
20131,Comparison of the 18-item and 6-item Lubben Social Network Scales with community-dwelling older adults in Mongolia.,"This study compares the psychometric properties of two versions of the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-18 and LSNS-6) with community dwelling older adults in Mongolia. We recruited 650 older adult in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar and the country's four rural regions. We used the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), the Short Form 12 (SF-12) physical and mental health functioning measures, and a multi-dimensional scale of social isolation for confirmatory factor analyses of the LSNS-18 and the LSNS-6. Both versions demonstrated excellent internal consistency and intraclass correlation and both correlated in expected directions with other study measures. Only the LSNS-6 provided a good fit to the data. The LSNS-6 is a viable instrument for assessing the social networks of older adults in Mongolia. The study adds to the sparse literature on measuring social and behavioral determinants of health in resource-constrained settings characterized by aging populations and high internal migration rates.","['Aged', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Humans', 'Independent Living', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Mongolia', 'Social Isolation', 'Social Networking']",30998800,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.308.225', 'I01.240.425.350', 'N01.224.425.350', 'N05.715.360.300.360', 'N06.850.505.400.425.350', 'N06.850.520.308.225'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I03.050.500', 'N01.224.791.550', 'N06.850.505.400.800.550'], ['F02.418', 'N01.400.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.252.474.651'], ['F01.145.813.781', 'I01.880.853.748'], ['L01.143.910']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
35773,The myosin motor in muscle generates a smaller and slower working stroke at higher load.,"Muscle contraction is driven by the motor protein myosin II, which binds transiently to an actin filament, generates a unitary filament displacement or 'working stroke', then detaches and repeats the cycle. The stroke size has been measured previously using isolated myosin II molecules at low load, with rather variable results, but not at the higher loads that the motor works against during muscle contraction. Here we used a novel X-ray-interference technique to measure the working stroke of myosin II at constant load in an intact muscle cell, preserving the native structure and function of the motor. We show that the stroke is smaller and slower at higher load. The stroke size at low load is likely to be set by a structural limit; at higher loads, the motor detaches from actin before reaching this limit. The load dependence of the myosin II stroke is the primary molecular determinant of the mechanical performance and efficiency of skeletal muscle.","['Animals', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Molecular Motor Proteins', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Myosin Type II', 'Ranidae', 'X-Rays']",15058307,"[['B01.050'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['G11.427.494.472'], ['D05.500.500', 'D08.811.277.040.025.193'], ['A10.690.552.500.500', 'A11.620.249'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['D05.750.078.730.475.475', 'D08.811.277.040.025.193.750.750', 'D12.776.210.500.600.470', 'D12.776.220.525.475.475'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.708'], ['G01.358.500.505.970', 'G01.750.250.970', 'G01.750.750.918']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
20805,Self-esteem and symptoms of depression in children with seizures: relationships with neuropsychological functioning and family variables over time.,"PURPOSE: To test over time the relationships of neuropsychological functioning to mental health in children following a first recognized seizure and, of primary importance, to determine if the strength of these relationships differs based on risk and protective factors.METHODS: In a larger prospective study, 135 children with a first seizure (ages 8-14 years) and 73 healthy sibling controls completed neuropsychological testing at baseline and 36 months. Structured telephone interviews were used to obtain data from children on mental health and family environment; major caregiving parents provided data on demographic and family variables. Data analyses included correlation coefficients and linear regression models.RESULTS: Children with seizures showed an overall trend for improvement in mental health. More children with seizures than siblings had declines in processing speed. Declines in neuropsychological functioning were correlated with worse mental health. With regard to risk and protective factors, higher parent education protected against decline in self-esteem related to decline in processing speed. Better family functioning and greater parental support protected against decline in self-esteem related to decrease in verbal memory and learning. Older child age protected against increase in depressive symptoms related to decline in processing speed.DISCUSSION: Seizure onset had a negative impact on mental health in children with declines in cognitive functioning except for older children and those with more family resources. Children should be assessed for declines in processing speed and, if found, those subgroups of children with less educated or more anxious parents and those in less supportive families should be targeted for interventions.","['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Depression', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Parents', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Seizures', 'Self Concept']",20412284,"[['M01.060.057'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['N05.715.350.075.100', 'N06.850.490.250.100'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['E05.318.740.400', 'N05.715.360.750.350', 'N06.850.520.830.400'], ['F01.829.263', 'I01.880.853.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.420', 'L01.399.250.520', 'N05.715.360.300.400', 'N06.850.520.308.420'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['F04.711.513'], ['F01.829.263.500.320', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340', 'M01.620'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['C10.597.742', 'C23.888.592.742'], ['F01.752.747.792']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0

Each strain of M. gallisepticum typed by PFGE and RAPD methods was genetically quite unique and RAPD and PFGE fingerprinting enabled strain characterization. Relationships between the M. gallisepticum and M. imitans strains were established and dendrograms were drawn from PFGE and RAPD patterns. PFGE group A and RAPD group D were significantly associated with M. imitans strains (P < 0.05). Three M. imitans strains shared the same PFGE and RAPD patterns. The two M. gallisepticum vaccine strains had singular PFGE and RAPD patterns. Thus, PFGE and RAPD can be used to investigate disease outbreaks in vaccinated flocks or for epidemiological tracking. For M. gallisepticum, the RAPD and PFGE discriminatory powers were superior to 0.95 and the in vitro, in ovo and in vivo reproducibility of RAPD and PFGE was 100%. The RAPD drawback was the inconsistent band intensity complicating the interpretation of patterns, while the PFGE limit was its low typeability (86%). Thus, these two molecular typing methods seemed complementary for M. gallisepticum epidemiological studies.","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Genetic Variation', 'Mycoplasma', 'Mycoplasma Infections', 'Poultry Diseases', 'Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Turkeys']",11765805,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['E05.196.401.220', 'E05.301.300.220'], ['G05.365'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.553'], ['C01.150.252.400.610.610'], ['C22.131.728'], ['E05.393.620.500.687', 'E05.601.700'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.800', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

23185,MOV10 interacts with Enterovirus 71 genomic 5'UTR and modulates viral replication.,"As a cytoplasmic parasite, RNA virus develops sophisticated mechanisms to counter host defense and utilize host proteins to facilitate its replication. Here we found Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10), a highly conserved cellular protein belonging to SF1 helicase family, played critical roles in EV71 infection. Silencing cellular MOV10 could restrict EV71 replication, while over-expressing MOV10 resulted in increased viral replication at low dosage and repressed viral replication at high dosage. Further investigation showed that MOV10 exhibited dual functions in EV71 regulation, its C-terminus positively regulated viral replication by binding to EV71 cloverleaf-like structure and the internal ribosome entry site while the N-terminus showed a potential antiviral activity when individually overexpressed. In addition, RNA-dependent interaction between MOV10 and HuR as well as the co-localization of MOV10 and processing bodies were also observed post infection. Taken together, our data indicate a crucial role of MOV10 in EV71 infection for the first time, providing new insights for its roles in EV71 infection.","[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'ELAV-Like Protein 1', 'Enterovirus A, Human', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genome, Viral', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Internal Ribosome Entry Sites', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Helicases', 'RNA, Viral', 'Virus Replication']",27666477,"[['D13.444.735.544.875.885', 'D13.444.735.790.878.885', 'G05.360.340.024.220.880.885', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.910.885'], ['D12.776.157.725.813.500.250', 'D12.776.664.962.813.500.250'], ['B04.820.578.750.284.180'], ['G05.308.203.374'], ['G05.360.340.358.840'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D13.444.735.790.878.942.250', 'G02.111.570.080.689.687.093', 'G05.360.080.689.687.093'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.750', 'G02.111.570.820.709.610.500'], ['D13.444.735'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.735.720'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['G06.920.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
16907,Cognitive fMRI and neuropsychological assessment in patients with secondarily generalized seizures.,"OBJECTIVES: Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent comorbid disorder in epilepsy which has been associated with high seizure frequency. We examined the effect of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (SGTCS) on cognitive dysfunction using neuropsychological assessment and fMRI.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with localization-related epilepsy of varying etiologies and SGTCS underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment. Functional MRI was performed probing the frontal and temporal lobes with two paradigms aimed at investigating speed of mental processing and working memory.RESULTS: A high number of total lifetime SGTCS was associated with lower intelligence scores. Moreover, a trend towards cognitive decline related to the number of SGTCS was observed. A relatively increased prefrontal activation related to the number of SGTCS was demonstrated, plus a trend towards a decreased activation in the frontotemporal areas.CONCLUSION: High numbers of SGTCS are associated with a drop in intelligence scores and altered prefrontal brain activation. A shift from frontotemporal to prefrontal activation seems to have occurred, suggesting that a functional reorganization of working memory is induced by a high number of SGTCS. It remains uncertain if this reorganization reflects a compensation mechanism, or the underlying pathological processes of cognitive dysfunction.","['Adult', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Linear Models', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Memory, Short-Term', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Problem Solving', 'Seizures', 'Temporal Lobe']",18339478,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['F03.615.250'], ['C10.228.140.490.375.290'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.711.141.493'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['F02.463.425.540.407'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.711.513'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270.700'], ['F02.463.425.725', 'F02.463.785.810'], ['C10.597.742', 'C23.888.592.742'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.863']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

5997,Pentachlorophenol treatment in vivo elevates point mutation rate in zebrafish p53 gene.,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP), a probable human carcinogen, has been heavily used as an aseptic and a biocide throughout the world, and is widely present in the environment. Recent survey in Germany revealed that the average PCP amount in the urine of general German populations was 1.04 microg/L while the peak concentration could reach up to 19.1 microg/L. PCP was reported to cause DNA damage, but whether it can be involved in inducing point mutations in genome is unknown. To determine the genotoxicity of PCP on vertebrate, we first performed acute toxicity test on zebrafish for the effect of PCP exposure. The LC50 values of zebrafish exposed to PCP at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h were determined to be 0.196, 0.130, 0.130 and 0.130 mg/L, respectively. We then treated zebrafish with PCP for 10 days at 0 (control), 0.5, 5 and 50 microg/L, respectively, to determine whether PCP could be involved in inducing point mutations. Employing denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and DNA sequencing, we demonstrated that exposure of PCP to zebrafish at a concentration as low as 5 microg/L for 10 days elevates point mutation rate in p53 gene in liver cells. This is the first direct evidence revealing that PCP can elevate point mutation rate in the vertebrate genomes. The result implies PCP might be involved in carcinogenesis by elevating point mutation rate in the somatic genomes.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fish Proteins', 'Insecticides', 'Liver', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pentachlorophenol', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute', 'Transition Temperature', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Zebrafish']",16904934,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D13.444.308'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D12.776.325'], ['D27.720.031.700.491', 'D27.888.723.491'], ['A03.620'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.190.633'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['E05.940.790'], ['G01.906.595.850'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.200.244.828']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
30979,Sedative effect of oral diazepam and chloral hydrate in the dental treatment of children.,"PURPOSE: The purpose was to evaluate two sedation protocols during dental sessions in anxious children.MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a randomized and double-blind study, with each individual being his/her own control within each protocol. Furthermore, the two protocols were compared. Twenty children (36 to 84 months old) who exhibited ""definitely negative"" behavior according to the Frankl scale were assigned to receive oral chloral hydrate (40 mg/kg) (Group I) or Diazepam (5 mg) (Group II). Behavior during local anesthesia, application of rubber dam, cavity preparation, restorative procedures was evaluated, considering the degree of sleep, body movement, crying and overall behavior. Vital signs were assessed at three different times. The Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Exact Fisher's and Spearman correlation tests were used to analyze the data.RESULTS: Group I presented higher scores for sleep during the CH session than placebo session during rubber dam application (P = 0.0431) and restoration (P = 0.0431). In Group II there was no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between sessions and groups in the evaluation of body movement, crying and vital signs. Overall behavior in the placebo session was better than in the CH session during local anesthesia, but there was no difference between the two drug regimens. There was influence of age during anesthesia and cavity preparation in Group I and during rubber dam application in Group II. It was concluded that oral diazepam and chloral hydrate had no influence on the behavior management for dental treatment with the studied sample.","['Administration, Oral', 'Age Factors', 'Anesthesia, Dental', 'Anesthesia, Local', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chloral Hydrate', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Crying', 'Dental Anxiety', 'Dental Care for Children', 'Dental Cavity Preparation', 'Dental Restoration, Permanent', 'Diazepam', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedatives', 'Movement', 'Placebos', 'Rubber Dams', 'Sleep']",17660640,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['E03.155.141', 'E06.045'], ['E03.155.086.231'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.145.179'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D02.033.455.250.130'], ['F01.145.813.115'], ['F01.145.209.530.258', 'F01.525.200.310.300'], ['F01.470.132.300'], ['E06.170.152', 'N02.421.240.190.215'], ['E06.931.325'], ['E06.323.428', 'E06.780.346.737', 'E07.695.190.190'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.070.216'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.696.277.350', 'D27.505.954.427.210.350'], ['G07.568', 'G11.427.410'], ['D26.660', 'E02.785'], ['E06.186.670', 'E07.222.670'], ['F02.830.855', 'G11.561.803']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
15511,Hypolipidemic activity of Anethum graveolens in rats.,"The aerial parts of Anethum graveolens (dillweed) are used in Iran as a hypolipidemic agent. The scientific basis for its use has yet to be established. In this study the hypolipidemic activity of dill powder and its essential oil (its most important fraction) were evaluated in male Wistar rats (180 +/- 20 g) fed a high cholesterol diet. Anethum graveolens essential oil (AGEO) was prepared by hydrodistillation and analysed using GC/MS. AGEO had a yield of 2% and GC/MS analysis showed that alpha-phellandrene (32%), limonene (28%) and carvone (28%) were its major components. Daily oral administration of AGEO to rats at doses of 45, 90 and 180 mg/kg for 2 weeks significantly and in a dose-dependent manner reduced total cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). AGEO also increased significantly high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Anethum graveolens powder when added to the diet of animals showed similar effects on serum lipids.

2509,[Expression and hypoxic regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in esophageal carcinoma].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the the expression and hypoxic regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9.METHODS: VEGF mRNA and MMP-9 mRNA were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 43 esophageal carcinoma specimens including 18 para-tumorous esophageal tissues. The expression of VEGF protein and mean microvessel density (MVD) in 56 specimens were examined by immunohistochemical stain. The effect of hypoxia on VEGF and MMP-9 expression in esophageal cancer cell lines was quantitatively determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).RESULTS: The VEGF expression in the tumorous tissue, being significantly correlated with MVD in the tumor, was remarkably higher than that in the para-tumorous tissue. VEGF and MVD expression in the tumor was significantly associated with stage and metastasis of esophageal carcinoma. The MMP-9 expression in the tumorous tissue, being uncorrelated with vessel count and clinicopathologic features in esophageal carcinoma, was significantly higher than that in the para-tumorous tissue. Hypoxia significantly increased the VEGF expression in esophageal cancer cell lines but did not affect the MMP-9 expression.CONCLUSIONS: The expression of VEGF plays an important role in the angiogenesis and metastasis of esophageal cancer, which is regulated by hypoxia. VEGF may serve as a predictor of progression in esophageal carcinoma and a potential target for antiangiogenic therapy of esophageal carcinoma.","['Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia', 'Lymphokines', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",11977637,"[['D12.644.276.390', 'D12.776.467.390', 'D23.529.390'], ['C04.588.274.476.205', 'C04.588.443.353', 'C06.301.371.205', 'C06.405.117.430', 'C06.405.249.205'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.852.079'], ['D12.644.276.374.480', 'D12.776.467.374.480', 'D23.529.374.480'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.205.360', 'D08.811.277.656.300.480.252.445', 'D08.811.277.656.300.480.525.700.350', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.205.360', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.252.445', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.525.700.350', 'D12.644.276.848.350', 'D12.776.467.836.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200'], ['D12.644.276.100.800', 'D12.776.467.100.800', 'D23.529.100.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
28535,Identification of a putative histidine kinase two-component phosphorelay gene (CaHK1) in Candida albicans.,"We have cloned and analysed the sequence of a putative histidine kinase, two-component gene (CaHK1) from Candida albicans. This gene encodes a 2471 amino acid protein (Cahk1p) with an estimated molecular mass of 281.8 kDa. A homology search of Cahk1p with other proteins in the databases showed that Cahk1p exhibits the greatest homology at its C-terminus with both the sensor and regulator components of prokaryotic and eukaryotic two-component histidine kinases. A further analysis of this homology showed that the Cahk1p possessed both sensor and regulator domains in the same polypeptide. Also, Cahk1p is likely to be a soluble protein. The sensor kinase domain of Cahk1p contains conserved motifs that are characteristic of all histidine kinase proteins, including the putative histidine which is believed to be autophosphorylated during activation, ATP binding motifs and others (F- and N-motifs), with unknown function. The Cahk1p regulator domain also contains conserved aspartate and lysine residues and the putative aspartate, which is secondarily phosphorylated by the autophosphorylated histidine. Finally, according to the codon usage frequency of the CaHK1 gene in comparison with other genes from C. albicans, there would appear to be a low level of expression of the gene.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Candida albicans', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Histidine Kinase', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinases', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",9639313,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.095', 'E05.301.300.074', 'E05.601.100'], ['E05.196.401.114', 'E05.301.300.087', 'E05.601.150'], ['B01.300.107.795.095.326', 'B01.300.381.147.326', 'B01.300.930.176.326'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['G05.360.325'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.364.500', 'G05.360.340.358.024.500', 'G05.360.340.358.365.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.424'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G05.360.600'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682'], ['E05.393.183.620.650', 'E05.393.712'], ['E05.393.760.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
40606,Introducing molecular testing of pyrazinamide susceptibility improves multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment outcomes: a prospective cohort study.,"The current treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) takes a lengthy period of 18-24 months and has a poor cure rate of 50-60%. A multicenter, prospective cohort study was conducted to assess the role of testing for molecular susceptibility to pyrazinamide (PZA) in optimising treatment for MDR-TB.We assigned 76 patients to an optimised molecular susceptibility group and 159 patients to a regular treatment group where PZA susceptibility was not determined. Of these patients, 152 were matched after propensity score matching (76 in the optimised group and 76 in the regular group). Treatment success rate was measured in the propensity-matched cohort as the primary outcome.Patients in the optimised group achieved a higher treatment success rate than those in the regular group (76.3% versus 55.3%, p=0.006). Of 51 patients with isolates that were susceptible to PZA and who were receiving a 12-month regimen, 42 (82.4%) were treated successfully. The optimised group showed faster culture conversion than the regular group (p=0.024). After exclusion of pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB), the treatment outcome in the optimised group was still better than the regular group (83.1% versus 62.1%, p=0.009).Introducing molecular susceptibility testing for PZA improved the treatment outcomes for MDR-TB without the use of new drugs. Introducing PZA for patients with PZA-susceptible (PZA-S) MDR-TB allows the current regimen to be shortened to 12 months with comparable success rates to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended shorter regimen.","['Adult', 'Amidohydrolases', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'China', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrazinamide', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant']",30578402,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D08.811.277.087'], ['D27.505.954.122.085.255'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['G06.099.225.812', 'G06.225.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.300.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['G05.365.590'], ['B03.510.024.962.500.702', 'B03.510.460.400.410.552.552.702'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D03.383.679.750'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846.775']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

PC-vaccine stimulated IgM and IgG2, but little IgG1, anti-PC -antibodies. No memory was induced and immunization in CFA produced tolerance. PC-KLH, on the other hand, stimulated IgM, IgG2, and IgG1 anti-PC antibodies with carrier-specific memory. Hapten inhibition of plaque formation showed uniform binding patterns with minor, but significant, differences between antiPC-vaccine and anti-PC-KLH antibodies. The antibodies were characterized by IEF and idiotypic analyses. Early after immunization with PC-vaccine, guinea pigs had restricted IEF patterns which in inbred, but not outbred animals were indistinguishable between individuals. These patterns remained restricted but more individualized with time after immunization. Anti-PC-KLH antibodies showed more heterogeneity and individuality.

A randomized, controlled clinical study].","Pharmacological prophylaxis is routinely applied after total hip replacement. Although it effectively reduces deep-vein thrombosis, side effects (bleeding, haematoma, swelling, thrombocytopenia) are not infrequent. Since in Germany use of foot pumps as only means of prophylaxis is unpopular, we investigated their efficacy and safety in a randomized study. 106 patients used either low molecular weight heparin (Fraxiparin, Sanofi-Synthelabo, Germany) or the foot-pump (A-V Impulse System, Orthofix, M?hltal, Germany), and were monitored for deep-vein thrombosis using serial duplex sonography on postoperative days 4, 12 and 45. Clinical observations included daily measurements of thigh circumference, recording of postoperative drainage amounts, and monitoring of wound healing. None of the 50 patients treated with the foot-pump developed deep-vein thrombosis, while 4 of the 50 patients (8 per cent) on pharmacological prophylaxis did so. Six patients stopped using the foot-pump during the study. One patient developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Patients on mechanical prophylaxis had smaller amounts of drainage (mean 247 ml vs. 272 ml, p = 0.485) and significantly less swelling of the thigh (10 mm compared with 15 mm, p or = < 0.001), The good results in terms of prevention of thromboembolic complications and soft tissue swelling favour the general use of foot pumps as mechanical prophylaxis.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticoagulants', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip', 'Bandages', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nadroparin', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Physical Therapy Modalities', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color', 'Venous Thrombosis']",12910861,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.502.119'], ['E04.555.110.110.110', 'E04.650.110.110', 'E04.680.101.110.110'], ['E07.101'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D09.698.373.400.300.600'], ['N04.761.559', 'N05.715.360.575'], ['E02.779', 'E02.831.535'], ['C23.550.767'], ['C08.381.746', 'C14.907.355.350.700'], ['C15.378.140.855'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.350.850.850.850.850'], ['C14.907.355.830.925']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
33122,Tumor budding and poorly-differentiated cluster in prognostication in Stage II colon cancer.,"Comparison between tumor budding (TB) and poorly-differentiated clusters (PDC) for prognostication in Stage II colon cancer was not extensively studied in literature. In this retrospective study, we assessed TB (according to the consensus statement in 2016) and PDC in 135 Stage II colon adenocarcinoma resection specimens. Counting of TB and PDC was performed on H&E slides. High-grade TB (Bd3 (?10 tumor buds in 0.785 mm2)) and high-grade PDC (Grade 3 (?10)) were found in 20% and 17% of cases respectively. High-grade TB was associated with pT4 (p = 0.008) and presence of lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.001). There was correlation between TB and PDC grades (p < 0.001), in which both grades were the same or one grade apart in majority of the cases (95%). Both TB and PDC correlated with 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) (DSS for TB: 89% (Bd1); 73% (Bd2); 52% (Bd3), p = 0.001) (DSS for PDC: 88% (Grade 1); 72% (Grade 2); 61% (Grade 3), p = 0.021). Survival curves of Stage II colon cancer could be further stratified by TB and PDC (log-rank tests: TB p < 0.001; PDC p = 0.009). Combining TB and PDC grades into single grading system (high-grade: Bd3 + G2, Bd2 + G3, Bd3 + G3; low-grade: other combinations) was found to have strong correlation with both 5-year DSS and OS (both p < 0.001). Our study has confirmed TB and PDC as independent prognostic factors in Stage II colon cancer, and might help selecting high-risk patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",29487008,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.612'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
7436,Occupational exposure to blood and other bodily fluids at a military hospital in Iraq.,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to bloodborne pathogens, namely HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, remains a risk for healthcare workers. Given the austere and challenging environments in a combat zone, it is unclear to what extent blood and other bodily fluid occupational exposures pose a risk of infection for military healthcare workers deployed to a level III military treatment facility in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.METHODS: This is a retrospective review of electronic infection control records at the Air Force Theater Hospital in Iraq in which blood and other bodily fluid occupational exposure data were available: October 1, 2005 through May 31, 2006 and January 15, 2007 through April 30, 2007.RESULTS: During the first study period, there were 46 exposures for an average monthly exposure of 5.8 (range, 2-16 per month). The majority of exposures were percutaneous fingersticks (74%), whereas the remainder were splashes (17%) or not documented (9%). During the second study period, there were 19 exposures with percutaneous device and splash exposure encompassing 68% and 32% of cases, respectively. The majority of occurrences were in the intensive care unit (53%) and primarily among nurses (37%). Overall, there were 65 exposures per 1,000 persons during the year review.CONCLUSIONS: During the time periods evaluated, a substantial number of blood and other bodily fluid exposures occurred in a combat zone military healthcare facility. This finding is comparable to US civilian institutions. Maintaining programs for preventing, tracking, and implementing postexposure prophylaxis remain a worthy and achievable goal at every military treatment facility, regardless of the austerity of the environment.","['Accidents, Occupational', 'Blood-Borne Pathogens', 'Hospitals, Military', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iraq War, 2003-2011', 'Needlestick Injuries', 'Personnel, Hospital', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trauma Centers']",19359972,"[['N06.850.135.240'], ['B05.155'], ['N02.278.421.510.180.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['I01.880.735.950.250.782', 'K01.400.504.984.249'], ['C26.986.950.500'], ['M01.526.485.740', 'N02.360.740'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.336.500', 'N02.421.297.195.480', 'N04.452.442.452.422.336.400']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

589,Can Abdominal Computed Tomography Imaging Help Accurately Identify a Dedifferentiated Component in a Well-Differentiated Liposarcoma?,"PURPOSE: To assess the ability of computed tomography (CT) to differentiate an atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) from a WDLPS with a dedifferentiated component (DDLPS) within it.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine untreated patients with abdominal atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas who had undergone contrast-enhanced CT were identified using an institutional database. Three radiologists who were blinded to the pathology findings evaluated all the images independently to determine whether a dedifferentiated component was present within the WDLPS. The CT images were evaluated for fat content (?25% or >25%); presence of ground-glass density, enhancing and/or necrotic nodules; presence of a capsule surrounding the mass; septations; and presence and pattern of calcifications. A multivariate logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations was used to correlate imaging features with pathology findings. Kappa statistics were calculated to assess agreement between the three radiologists.RESULTS: On the basis of pathological findings, 12 patients had been diagnosed with DDLPS within a WDLPS and 37 had been diagnosed with WDLPS. The presence of an enhancing or a centrally necrotic nodule within the atypical lipomatous tumor was associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (P = 0.02 and P = 0.0003, respectively). The three readers showed almost perfect agreement in overall diagnosis (ê r = 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.99).CONCLUSIONS: An enhancing or centrally necrotic nodule may be indicative of a dedifferentiated component in well-differentiated liposarcoma. Ground-glass density nodules may not be indicative of dedifferentiation.","['Abdominal Neoplasms', 'Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposarcoma', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Radiography, Abdominal', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",27454788,"[['C04.588.033'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.171'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.450.550.420', 'C04.557.450.795.465'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['E01.370.350.700.715'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
38607,The dynamics of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation predict relapse in patients with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia.,"BACKGROUND: The optimal monitoring schedules and cutoff minimal residual disease (MRD) levels for the accurate prediction of relapse at all time points after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remain unclear in patients with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).METHODS: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels were measured in bone marrow samples collected from 208 patients at scheduled time points after transplantation (1530 samples in total).RESULTS: A total of 92.3% of the requested samples were collected, and 74.0% of patients had complete sample collection. The 1-, 3-, and 6-month RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels could significantly discriminate between continuous complete remission and a hematologic relapse at 1.5-3, 4-6, and 7-12 months but not at >3, >6, and >12 months, respectively. Over 90% of the 175 patients who were in continuous complete remission had a ?3-log reduction in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels from the time of diagnosis at each time point after transplantation and a ?4-log reduction at ?12 months. A <3-log reduction within 12 months and/or a <4-log reduction at ?12 months was significantly related to a higher 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rate in both the entire cohort and the patients with no intervention after HSCT (58.4 vs. 2.2%, 76.5 vs. 2.0%; all P < 0.0001). Patients who had received a preemptive donor lymphocyte infusion when the increase in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts was ?1-log according to the above dual cutoff values had significantly lower 1-year CIR rate after intervention than the patients who had received an infusion when the increase was >1-log (0 vs. 55.0%, P = 0.015).CONCLUSIONS: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts with a <3-log reduction from diagnosis within 12 months and/or a <4-log reduction at ?12 months after allo-HSCT could accurately predict relapse and may prompt a timely intervention in patients with t(8;21) AML.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Neoplasm', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recurrence', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",28166825,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['A01.941.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.505.510', 'G05.360.162.520.300.505.510'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.325.340', 'G05.360.162.520.300.325.340'], ['D12.776.930.155.200.200'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['G05.308.370.500'], ['E02.095.147.500.500.500', 'E04.936.225.687.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.337.539.275'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.700', 'C23.550.727.700'], ['D12.776.602.500.500', 'D12.776.624.664.500'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D13.444.735.615'], ['D12.776.624.664.700.936', 'D12.776.930.780.625.575'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['C23.550.210.870', 'G05.365.590.175.870', 'G05.558.860'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
32262,Roles of insulin receptor substrate-1 and Shc on insulin-like growth factor I receptor signaling in early passages of cultured human fibroblasts.,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) improves glucose metabolism and growth in patients with leprechaunism. We investigated signal transduction through IGF-I receptor in comparison with epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in early passages of cultured skin fibroblasts from a normal subject and a patient with leprechaunism whose insulin receptor tyrosine kinase was almost nonexistent. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) became tyrosine-phosphorylated and bound growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) quickly by IGF-I. The association of Shc with GRB2 by IGF-I was detected by immunoblot with anti-Shc antibody but was hardly visible with antiphosphotyrosine antibody, which was in marked contrast to efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc by EGF. However, the potency of IGF-I for DNA synthesis was far stronger than EGF, which was not parallel with the potency of these growth factors to activate Shc or MAP kinase. Rather, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity, which was activated by IGF-I about 5- to 10-fold more strongly than EGF, appeared to correlate with mitogenesis. Signal transduction pathways following IGF-I receptor or EGF receptor activation were indistinguishable between the normal subject and the patient. Our results strongly suggest that in human skin fibroblasts, which represent a more physiological cell culture: 1) IRS-1, rather than Shc, is the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein binding GRB2 in initial phase of IGF-I signaling; 2) mitogenic potency of receptor tyrosine kinases such as IGF-I receptor and EGF receptor may not be determined solely by the amount of Shc-GRB2 complex or the activity of MAP kinase; and 3) in contrast to previous reports, IGF-I and EGF receptor signalings are not defective in leprechaunism.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Mitogens', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Proteins', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1', 'Receptor, Insulin', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1']",9003010,"[['D12.644.360.024', 'D12.776.157.057', 'D12.776.476.024'], ['D12.776.543.990.150'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.125', 'D12.644.360.100', 'D12.776.476.100'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D06.472.317.350', 'D12.644.276.382.500', 'D12.776.467.382.500', 'D23.529.382.500'], ['D12.644.276.624.120', 'D12.776.467.624.120', 'D23.529.624.120'], ['A11.329.228'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.380', 'E05.601.470.380'], ['D12.644.360.024.301', 'D12.776.157.057.045', 'D12.776.476.024.382'], ['D12.644.276.937.400', 'D12.776.124.862.400', 'D12.776.467.937.400', 'D23.529.937.400'], ['D27.505.519.593.624'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D12.776.744'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D12.125.072.050.875.750', 'D12.125.740.740'], ['D12.776'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.185', 'D12.776.543.750.630.468', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.780.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.200', 'D12.776.543.750.630.484', 'D12.776.543.750.750.580.300'], ['D12.644.360.024.330', 'D12.776.157.057.162', 'D12.776.476.024.424'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.644.360.024.330.500', 'D12.776.157.057.162.500', 'D12.776.476.024.424.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
161,"Social and racial inequalities in preterm births in Western Australia, 1984 to 2006.","Preterm birth is associated with a range of childhood morbidities and in industrialised societies is the primary cause of infant mortality. Social and racial inequalities in preterm birth have been reported in North America, UK, Europe and New Zealand. This study utilised population-level data to investigate social and racial inequalities in preterm birth among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants in Western Australia. All live, singleton births between 1984 and 2006 (n = 567 468) were included, and multilevel multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate relative differences in preterm infants between socio-economic groups. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants were analysed separately. The prevalence of preterm births increased from 7.1% in 1984-88 to 7.5% in 1999-2003, before decreasing to 7.2% in 2004-06. Inequalities in preterm births between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants increased over time, with the percentage of preterm births being almost twofold higher for Aboriginal infants (14.8%), compared with non-Aboriginal infants (7.6%). A significant portion of the disparity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants is attributable to parental socio-economic and demographic characteristics, though the disparity continues to persist even after adjustment for these factors. While the overall rates of preterm birth in Western Australia have remained fairly static over the last two decades, the disparity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants has increased and is now similar to inequalities seen 20 years ago. These findings highlight a major public health issue that should be of great concern, given the short- and long-term morbidities and complications associated with preterm birth.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oceanic Ancestry Group', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Western Australia', 'Young Adult']",20618725,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['M01.686.508.600'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['C13.703.420.491.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['Z01.639.100.996', 'Z01.678.100.373.996'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
39129,The influence of film processing temperature and time on mammographic image quality.,"High image quality and low radiation levels are essential in mammography. This study investigates the effect of changes in processor temperatures and developing times on sensitometric findings. These findings were matched with the changes in the image quality during similar changes in the developing parameters. Temperatures ranging between 35 degrees C and 40 degrees C and developing times from 20 s and 50 s were investigated. Higher developing temperatures and increased developing times resulted in an increase in film speed and film contrast. A definite pattern of change could be demonstrated in film speed and film contrast during sensitometry. The same pattern of change could, however, not be demonstrated in the quality of phantom images under similar circumstances. The base plus fog level was not adversely affected. Sensitometric findings of film speed can be effectively used as an indicator of radiation exposure to the patient, but cannot be used to establish the developing parameters that will give the best image quality. Both these methods should be used to determine which processing variables should be used to obtain a combination of the best image with radiation as low as possible. Recommendations for optimum processing parameters are made for the films and processing chemistry investigated.","['Female', 'Humans', 'Mammography', 'Models, Structural', 'Technology, Radiologic', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'X-Ray Film']",7719681,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.700.500'], ['J01.897.280.500.545', 'L01.178.820.090.545'], ['E05.920', 'H02.010.850', 'J01.897.891'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E07.960']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0

A 31-year-old man who had a family history of angioedema was admitted to our hospital with complaints of abdominal pain and swelling of extremities. Computed tomography scan and endoscopy carried out during this attack revealed transient gastrointestinal wall edema which, along with decreased levels of serum C4 and C1 inhibitor, confirmed the diagnosis of HAE with gastrointestinal involvement. During the attack, the gastric mucosa was erythematous and edematous, and parts of its surface bulged into the gastric lumen, resembling a submucosal tumor, as a result of massive submucosal edema. During the healing process, a number of small nodules and raised erosions developed over the entire gastric mucosal surface after healing of prominent gastric edema. Within 55 days, the gastric mucosa had returned to normal. The endoscopic findings for the stomach in HAE have not, to our knowledge, been previously described.","['Adult', 'Angioedema', 'Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins', 'Complement C4', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Male']",10376461,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C14.907.079', 'C17.800.862.945.066', 'C20.543.480.904.066'], ['D12.644.861.140', 'D12.776.124.486.274.920.250', 'D12.776.872.140'], ['D12.776.124.486.274.350'], ['E01.370.372.250.250', 'E01.370.388.250.250.250', 'E04.210.240.250', 'E04.502.250.250.250'], ['A03.556.875.875.440', 'A10.615.550.291'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

First, the A* channel in CIE LAB color space is extracted for contrast enhancement. Then, in order to effectively extract cytoplasm boundaries when image histograms present non-bimodal distribution, Otsu multiple thresholding is performed on the contrast enhanced image to generate initial segments, based on which the segments are refined by the multi-way graph cut method. We use 21 cervical cell images with non-ideal imaging condition to evaluate cytoplasm segmentation performance.

5299,"Heterotrimeric G protein betagamma subunits stimulate FLJ00018, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 and Cdc42.","We previously reported that Gbetagamma signaling regulates cell spreading or cell shape change through activation of a Rho family small GTPase, suggesting the existence of a Gbetagamma-regulated Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF). In this study we examined various RhoGEF clones, found FLJ00018 to beaGbetagamma-activated RhoGEF, and investigated the molecular mechanism of Gbetagamma-induced activation of Rho family GTPases. Co-expression of the genes for FLJ00018 and Gbetagamma enhanced serum response element-mediated gene transcription in HEK-293 cells. Combined expression of Gbetagamma and FLJ00018 significantly induced activation of Rac and Cdc42 but not RhoA. FLJ00018 also enhanced gene transcription induced by carbachol-stimulated m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and this enhancement was blocked by pertussis toxin. Furthermore, we demonstrated Gbetagamma to interact directly with the N-terminal region of FLJ00018 and the N-terminal fragment of this molecule to inhibit serum response element-dependent transcription induced by Gbetagamma/FLJ00018 and carbachol. In NIH3T3 cells, FLJ00018 enhanced lysophosphatidic acid-induced cell spreading, which was also blocked by the N-terminal fragment of FLJ00018. These results provide evidence for a signaling pathway by which G(i)-coupled receptor specifically induces Rac and Cdc42 activation through direct interaction of Gbetagamma with FLJ00018.","['Animals', 'Carbachol', 'Cell Shape', 'Cholinergic Agonists', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Lysophospholipids', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neuropeptides', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Receptor, Muscarinic M2', 'Serum Response Element', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein']",18045877,"[['B01.050'], ['D02.092.877.883.333.115', 'D02.675.276.232.115'], ['G04.320'], ['D27.505.519.625.120.140', 'D27.505.696.577.120.140'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['G05.297'], ['D12.644.360.325.300', 'D12.776.476.325.300'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.200', 'D12.644.360.360', 'D12.776.157.325.332', 'D12.776.476.375', 'D12.776.543.325'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D10.570.755.375.760.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A11.251.210.100.550', 'A11.329.228.100.550'], ['D12.644.400', 'D12.776.631.650'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.115.680', 'D23.946.123.946.690', 'D23.946.896.980.690'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.475.200', 'D12.776.543.750.720.360.500.200'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.330.700.800', 'G02.111.570.080.689.675.700.800', 'G05.360.080.689.330.700.800', 'G05.360.080.689.675.700.800', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.249.765.800', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680.765.800'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.700.050', 'D12.644.360.525.700.050', 'D12.776.157.325.515.700.050', 'D12.776.476.525.700.050'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.700.100', 'D12.644.360.525.700.100', 'D12.776.157.325.515.700.100', 'D12.776.476.525.700.100'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.700.100.500', 'D12.644.360.525.700.100.100', 'D12.776.157.325.515.700.100.100', 'D12.776.476.525.700.100.100'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.700', 'D12.644.360.525.700', 'D12.776.157.325.515.700', 'D12.776.476.525.700'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.700.200', 'D12.644.360.525.700.200', 'D12.776.157.325.515.700.200', 'D12.776.476.525.700.200']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6642,Autocrine growth factors for human tumor clonogenic cells.,"A human epithelial-derived cell line, SW-13, releases a soluble substance that functions as an autocrine growth factor. SW-13 cells, derived from a human adenocarcinoma of the adrenal cortex, form a few small colonies when suspended in soft agar at low densities. The number of colonies increased significantly when either viable SW-13 cells or serum-free medium conditioned by SW-13 cells (CM) was added to agar underlayers. CM increased colony formation in a dose-dependent fashion. Clonal growth at low cell densities was dependent on the presence of both horse serum and SW-13 CM. Neither activity alone was capable of sustaining growth. Even when cells were plated at high densities CM could not substitute for serum, but could reduce the threshold serum concentration. The results suggest that autocrine and serum-derived factors act in concert to maintain clonal growth of epithelial tumor cells in soft agar.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adrenal Gland Neoplasms', 'Agar', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Epithelium', 'Growth Substances', 'Humans']",4067361,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['C04.588.322.078', 'C19.053.347', 'C19.344.078'], ['D09.698.360.041'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['A10.272'], ['D27.505.696.377'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23386,Neurofibromatosis 2: clinical and DNA linkage studies of a large kindred.,"At least eight provisional categories of neurofibromatosis have been proposed. Among these, neurofibromatosis 1 (von Recklinghausen's disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis) and neurofibromatosis 2 (central or bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis) have been established as distinct disorders. We studied 15 affected male and 8 affected female members of one large kindred with neurofibromatosis 2. None of the patients met the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis 1. Between the ages of 15 and 53 years, the patients had multiple central nervous system tumors of various types--mainly, bilateral acoustic neuromas. Two or more tumors eventually developed in 20 of the patients; 9 had evidence of only bilateral acoustic neuromas. Meningiomas and ependymomas were more common among the young patients; those who initially presented with acoustic neuromas were nearly a decade older. Intracranial nontumoral calcifications were present in most patients and were also found in symptom-free children. The presence of such lesions is probably a prodromic feature of neurofibromatosis 2. Simultaneous analysis of D22S1 and IGLV DNA markers for coinheritance with neurofibromatosis 2 indicates that the locus for the disease is near the center of the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11.1----22q13.1). The eventual isolation of this disease gene may reveal a cause of the most common intracranial tumors in humans.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Ependymoma', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms', 'Meningioma', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neuroma, Acoustic', 'Pedigree']",3134615,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['C04.588.614.250.195', 'C10.228.140.211', 'C10.551.240.250'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.505.515', 'G05.360.162.520.300.505.515'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.380.290', 'C04.557.470.670.380.290', 'C04.557.580.625.600.380.290'], ['G05.348'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.614.250.580', 'C10.551.240.500'], ['C04.557.580.520', 'C04.557.645.520', 'C04.588.614.250.580.500', 'C10.551.240.500.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.557.580.600.580.590.650', 'C04.700.631.650', 'C10.562.600.500', 'C10.574.500.549.400', 'C10.668.829.675', 'C16.320.400.560.400', 'C16.320.700.633.650'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.595.610', 'C04.557.580.600.610.595.610', 'C04.557.580.625.650.595.610', 'C04.588.614.300.015', 'C04.588.614.596.240.015', 'C09.218.807.800.675', 'C09.647.675', 'C10.292.225.750', 'C10.292.910.600'], ['E05.393.673']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

We used strain Azotobacter chroococcum 7B, an effective producer of PHB, for biosynthesis of not only homopolymer and its main copolymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHB-HV), but also novel terpolymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PHB-HV-PEG), using sucrose as the primary carbon source and valeric acid and poly(ethylene glycol) 300 (PEG 300) as additional carbon sources. The chemical structure of PHB-HV-PEG was confirmed by (1)H nuclear-magnetic resonance analysis. The physico-chemical properties (molecular weight, crystallinity, hydrophilicity, surface energy) of produced biopolymer, the protein adsorption to the terpolymer, and cell growth on biopolymer films were studied. Despite of low EG-monomers content in bacterial-origin PHB-HV-PEG polymer, the terpolymer demonstrated significant improvement in biocompatibility in vitro in contrast to PHB and PHB-HV polymers, which may be coupled with increased protein adsorption, hydrophilicity and surface roughness of PEG-containing copolymer.","['Azotobacter', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biopolymers', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Molecular Weight']",23468935,"[['B03.440.400.425.625.050', 'B03.660.250.580.022'], ['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['D05.750.078', 'D25.720.099', 'J01.637.051.720.099'], ['E05.196.131.310', 'E05.196.370.310'], ['G04.022'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['E01.370.350.515.666.400', 'E05.595.666.400'], ['G02.494']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
41993,Redox Engineering by Ectopic Overexpression of NADH Kinase in Recombinant Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii,"High-level expression and secretion of heterologous proteins in yeast cause an increased energy demand, which may result in altered metabolic flux distributions. Moreover, recombinant protein overproduction often results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress, causing deviations from the optimal NAD(P)H regeneration balance. In this context, overexpression of genes encoding enzymes catalyzing endogenous NADPH-producing reactions, such as the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, has been previously shown to improve protein production in Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella spp.). In this study, we evaluate the overexpression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae POS5-encoded NADH kinase in a recombinant P. pastoris strain as an alternative approach to overcome such redox constraints. Specifically, POS5 was cooverexpressed in a strain secreting an antibody fragment, either by directing Pos5 to the cytosol or to the mitochondria. The physiology of the resulting strains was evaluated in continuous cultivations with glycerol or glucose as the sole carbon source, as well as under hypoxia (on glucose). Cytosolic targeting of Pos5 NADH kinase resulted in lower biomass-substrate yields but allowed for a 2-fold increase in product specific productivity. In contrast, Pos5 NADH kinase targeting to the mitochondria did not affect growth physiology and recombinant protein production significantly. Growth physiological parameters were in silico evaluated using the recent upgraded version (v3.0) of the P. pastoris consensus genome-scale metabolic model iMT1026, providing insights on the impact of POS5 overexpression on metabolic flux distributions.IMPORTANCE Recombinant protein overproduction often results in oxidative stress, causing deviations from the optimal redox cofactor regeneration balance. This becomes one of the limiting factors in obtaining high levels of heterologous protein production. Overexpression of redox-affecting enzymes has been explored in other organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a means to fine tune the cofactor regeneration balance in order to obtain higher protein titers. In the present work, this strategy is explored in P. pastoris In particular, one NADH kinase enzyme from S. cerevisiae (Pos5) is used, either in the cytosol or in mitochondria of P. pastoris, and its impact on the production of a model protein (antibody fragment) is evaluated. A significant improvement in the production of the model protein is observed when the kinase is directed to the cytosol. These results are significant in the field of heterologous protein production in general and in particular in the development of improved metabolic engineering strategies for P. pastoris.","['Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Metabolic Engineering', 'Microorganisms, Genetically-Modified', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)', 'Pichia', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins']",31757828,"[['G05.308.330'], ['E05.393.420.526', 'E05.481.500.311.249', 'J01.293.069.249.249'], ['B05.620.368'], ['D12.776.575'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D08.811.913.696.620'], ['B01.300.107.795.700', 'B01.300.930.600'], ['D12.776.828'], ['B01.300.107.795.785.800', 'B01.300.930.705.655'], ['D12.776.354.750']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

34228,Antiendothelial antibodies in sera of patients with infective endocarditis.,"Infective endocarditis is characterized by the colonization of endocardium by microorganisms. Except for Staphylococcus aureus, microorganisms are not able to adhere to and grow on endocardial cells; prior damage, e.g., by shear stress or other mechanical factors, is necessary. But other causes may well have a share. This study was, therefore, designed to identify immunological factors, especially antibodies against endothelial cells, which could contribute to the initiation of endocardial injury. Sera of patients with infective endocarditis and healthy controls were investigated for the presence of antibodies against endothelial antigen. As the antigen source human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used. Antibodies against endothelial cells were detected by indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA, immunoblotting, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and antibody mediated cytotoxicity. Antibodies against endothelial cells were found in seven out of fifteen patients. These antibodies were directed against cytoplasmic structures and only appeared in the course of the disease. A correlation between the presence of these antibodies and disease activity or the outcome of disease was not observed.

Mean basal LH was 7.7 +/- 1.0 mIU/ml, increased to a maximum of 120 +/- 22.7 mIU/ml, and then declined to levels between 28--34 mIU/ml for the last 30 hrs of infusion; FSH rose from 3.7 to 11.4 mIU/ml (p less than 0.05) at 16 hrs and then returned to baseline. Testosterone levels rose by 50% at 12 hrs, and remained elevated throughout with maximum values between 6.6 and 12 ng/ml. Estradiol-17beta levels were 26.2 +/- 4.7 pg/ml basally, rose to 104 +/- 8 pg/ml and while levels declined therafter, they were significantly above baseline throughout the 72 hrs. Plasma androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone levels also showed significant increases. By contrast, transient elevations in pregnenolone and 17-hydroxypregnenolone levels probably corresponded to the nomral morning rise in plasma levels of these steroids; 17-hydroxyprogesterone rose from 1.3 +/- 0.15 to 3.9 +/- 0.26 ng/ml at 12 hrs and remained elevated through the infusion. An increase in 17-hydroxyprogesterone:testosterone ratio was observed in all subjects. Thus, chronic LHRH infusion effected a persistent increase in endogenous LH with, in turn, prolonged stimulation of gonadal steroid secretion.","['17-alpha-Hydroxypregnenolone', 'Adult', 'Androgens', 'Androstenedione', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone', 'Estradiol', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Gonadotropins, Pituitary', 'Humans', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Male', 'Progesterone', 'Progestins', 'Testosterone']",156193,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
155,Restenosis after transluminal coronary angioplasty detected with exercise-gated radionuclide ventriculography.,"Forty-one patients were evaluated with exercise-gated radionuclide ventriculography before and within 4 days after successful transluminal coronary angioplasty and 4 to 12 months later. Patients were subgrouped according to the degree of restenosis demonstrated angiographically at 4 to 12 months (Group I [n = 23]: less than or equal to 20%; Group II [n = 10]: greater than 20% but less than 50%; Group III [n = 8]: greater than or equal to 50%). Patients with abnormal findings on gated radionuclide ventriculography (less than 5 point increase in ejection fraction or wall motion deterioration) early after angioplasty were eventually found to have a greater degree of restenosis than were patients with normal findings (41.2 +/- 30.3 versus 19.0 +/- 25.4% restenosis, p less than 0.0001). The accuracy of abnormal radionuclide ventriculography in predicting 50% or greater restenosis was 73% immediately after angioplasty and 77% at the time of follow-up angiography. Gated radionuclide ventriculographic results were abnormal in 5% of Group I patients compared with 75% of Group III patients (p less than 0.01) early after angioplasty; at late follow-up, they were abnormal in 27% of Group I patients compared with 88% of Group III patients (p less than 0.01). Group I patients had a greater increase in ejection fraction than did Group III patients at early (+11.3 +/- 7.5 versus + 3.5 +/- 6.5 points, p less than 0.01) and late (+11.8 +/- 7.8 versus -1.9 +/- 8.7 points, p less than 0.0005) follow-up. It is concluded that gated radionuclide ventriculography is useful in predicting coronary restenosis after transluminal coronary angioplasty.","['Aged', 'Angioplasty, Balloon', 'Constriction, Pathologic', 'Coronary Disease', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Physical Exertion', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Recurrence', 'Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m', 'Stroke Volume', 'Time Factors']",6094635,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E02.148.050.060', 'E04.100.814.529.124.060', 'E04.502.382.124.060', 'E05.157.016.060'], ['C23.300.287'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['A07.015.114.269', 'A07.015.908.194'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['A07.541'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G11.427.683'], ['E01.370.350.710', 'E01.370.384.730'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['D01.925.800'], ['E01.370.370.380.150.700', 'G09.330.380.124.882'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
27940,Acceleration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced neutrophilic nuclear lobulation by overexpression of Lyn tyrosine kinase.,"Stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) induces myeloid precursor cells to differentiate into neutrophils, and tyrosine phosphorylation of certain cellular proteins is crucial to this process. However, the signaling pathways for neutrophil differentiation are still obscure. As the Src-like tyrosine kinase, Lyn, has been reported to play a role in G-CSF-induced proliferation in avian lymphoid cells, we examined its involvement in G-CSF-induced signal transduction in mammalian cells. Expression plasmids for wild-type Lyn (Lyn) and kinase-negative Lyn (LynKN) were introduced into a murine granulocyte precursor cell line, GM-I62M, that can respond to G-CSF with neutrophil differentiation, and cell lines that overexpressed these molecules (GM-Lyn, GM-LynKN) were established. Upon G-CSF stimulation, both the GM-Lyn and GM-LynKN cells began to differentiate into neutrophils, showing early morphological changes within a few days, much more rapidly than did the parental cells, which started to exhibit nuclear lobulation about 10 days after the cells were transferred to G-CSF-containing medium. However, the time course of expression of the myeloperoxidase gene, another neutrophil differentiation marker, was not affected by the overexpression of Lyn or LynKN. Therefore, in normal cells, protein interactions with Lyn, but not its kinase activity, are important for the induction of G-CSF-induced neutrophilic nuclear lobulation in mammalian granulopoiesis.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils', 'Peroxidase', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tyrosine', 'src-Family Kinases']",11784333,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.152'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['D12.644.276.374.410.240.350', 'D12.776.395.240.200', 'D12.776.467.374.410.240.350', 'D23.529.374.410.240.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['D08.811.682.732.700'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D12.125.072.050.875'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
21621,Evaluation of melt granulation and ultrasonic spray congealing as techniques to enhance the dissolution of praziquantel.,"Praziquantel (PZQ), an anthelminthic drug widely used in developing countries, is classified in Class II in the Biopharmaceutics Classification Systems; this means that PZQ has very low water solubility and high permeability, thus the dissolution is the absorption rate-limiting factor. The aim of this work was to evaluate the suitability of melt granulation and ultrasonic spray congealing as techniques for enhancing the dissolution rate of PZQ. Granules in high shear mixer were prepared by melt granulation, using polyethylene glycol 4000 or poloxamer 188 as meltable binders and alpha-lactose monohydrate as a filler. Quite regularly shaped granules having main size fraction in the range 200-500 microm were obtained using both formulations; however, only poloxamer 188 granules demonstrated a significant (P=0.05) increase of the PZQ dissolution rate compared to pure drug. To evaluate the potential of ultrasonic spray congealing, Gelucire 50/13 microparticles having different drug to carrier ratios (5, 10, 20 and 30%, w/w) were then prepared. The results showed that all the microparticles had a significant higher dissolution rate (P=0.05) respect to pure PZQ. The increase of the PZQ content considerably decreased the dissolution rate of the drug: 5 and 10% PZQ loaded systems evidenced dissolution significantly enhanced compared to 20 and 30% PZQ microparticles. The microparticle's characterisation, performed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Hot Stage Microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and FT-Infrared analysis, evidenced the absence of both modifications of the solid state of PZQ and of significant interactions between the drug and the carrier. In conclusion, melt granulation and ultrasonic spray congealing could be proposed as solvent free, rapid and low expensive manufacturing methods to increase the in vitro dissolution rate of PZQ.","['Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Drug Compounding', 'Fats', 'Nanoparticles', 'Oils', 'Particle Size', 'Pharmaceutical Solutions', 'Poloxamer', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Powders', 'Praziquantel', 'Solubility', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Ultrasonics', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",16697539,"[['E05.196.131.310', 'E05.196.370.310'], ['H01.158.703.007', 'H01.181.466'], ['E05.916.270'], ['D10.212'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['D10.627'], ['G02.712'], ['D26.776.708', 'D27.505.954.578', 'D27.720.752'], ['D02.033.455.250.700.682', 'D05.750.741.667', 'D25.720.741.667', 'J01.637.051.720.741.667'], ['D02.033.455.250.700', 'D05.750.741', 'D25.720.741', 'J01.637.051.720.741'], ['D26.255.779'], ['D03.633.100.531.690'], ['G02.805'], ['E05.196.712.726.676.700', 'E05.196.867.826.676.700'], ['H01.671.031.849'], ['E05.196.309.742', 'E05.196.822.950', 'G01.867.950', 'G02.965']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

In the first season (September 1997-January 1998), eight male swimmers (age 19-25 years) of the Italian National Team participated, after 12 weeks of increased training volume, in a preparatory national competition (PWC) and then, after a further 6 weeks of specific training, in the World Championships (WC, both competitions in a 50-m pool), which represented the main competition at the end of the 18-week-long winter season. In the second season (September 1998-December 1998), a group of ten high-level male swimmers (18-22 years) participated, after 8 weeks of increased training volume, in a preparatory national competition (PIC) and then, after a further 6 weeks of specific training, in the Italian Championships (IC, both competitions in a 25-m pool), the main competition at the end of the 14-week-long winter season. A tapering period lasting 1-3 weeks was observed before the main competition in both seasons. All swimmers were competing at distances of up to 400 m; two of them participated in the study in both seasons. The swimming velocities and post-competition blood lactate concentrations were higher in the main competitions than in the preparatory competitions in both seasons. Pre-competition plasma cortisol (CORT) concentrations were higher than the initial values at the beginning of the season, reaching maximal values at the preparatory competitions and then decreasing before the main competitions in both seasons. The percentage increase in individual swimming velocity from the preparatory to the main competition was positively correlated with the corresponding increase in post-competition blood lactate (r = 0.63, P = 0.046) in the 1997 season (WC), and negatively correlated with the corresponding decrease in pre-competition CORT concentration (r = -0.66, P = 0.019) in the 1998 season (IC). Our results indicate that a decrease in pre-competition CORT could be a prerequisite for an improvement in swimming performance.","['Adult', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Lactic Acid', 'Male', 'Physical Fitness', 'Swimming']",10985589,"[['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['G11.427.685', 'I03.450.642.845.054.800', 'N01.400.545'], ['G11.427.410.568.800', 'G11.427.410.698.277.875', 'I03.350.875', 'I03.450.642.845.945.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
37276,Effect of exchange transfusion on elimination of antibiotics in premature infants.,"Although the use of exchange transfusion has become routine in intensive care nurseries, little information is available on drug loss resulting from exchange transfusion. The aim of this study was to review the effect of exchange transfusion on the elimination of some antibiotics in premature infants according to the recent pharmacokinetic data.

Our data suggest that exchange transfusion can significantly decrease the serum concentrations of antibiotics with smaller volumes of distribution, but the drug loss of antibiotics with larger volumes of distribution can be acceptable.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Exchange Transfusion, Whole Blood', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature']",8191611,"[['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['E02.095.135.469'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.429'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.703.520.520']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
3642,[Follow-up and counselling after pelvic inflammatory disease: CNGOF and SPILF Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases Guidelines].,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the procedures for follow-up and counselling of patients after pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).METHODS: A search in the Cochrane database, PubMed, and Google was performed using keywords related to follow-up and PID to identify reports published between 1990 and 2018. All studies published in French and English relevant to the areas of focus were included. A level of evidence (LE) based on the quality of the data available was applied for each area of focus and used for the guidelines.RESULTS: The rate of recurrent PID is 15 to 21%. They are related to a recurrent sexually transmitted infection (STI) in 20 to 34% of cases. Recurrence PID increase the risk of infertility and chronic pelvic pain (LE2). Follow-up is recommended after PID (grade C). The rate of patients lost to follow-up is around 40%. Follow-up is improved by personalized text message reminders (grade B). Vaginal sampling for detection of N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, (and M. genitalium) by nucleic acid amplification techniques is recommended 3 to 6 months after treatment of PID associated with STI to rule out possible reinfections (grade C). The use of condoms after PID associated with STI is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrences (grade C). The systematic use of contraceptive pills after PID is not recommended to prevent subsequent infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Vaginal sampling for microbiological diagnosis is recommended before the insertion of an intrauterine device (grade B). The risk of ectopic pregnancy is high in these women and must be kept in mind.CONCLUSION: Patient counselling and microbiological testing after PID decrease the risk of STI and thus the recurrence of PID.","['Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Condoms', 'Contraception', 'Counseling', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female', 'Mycoplasma genitalium', 'Neisseria gonorrhoeae', 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Vagina']",30878686,"[['B03.440.190.190.190.750'], ['E07.190.270.150'], ['E02.875.194'], ['F02.784.176', 'F04.408.413', 'N02.421.143.303', 'N02.421.461.363'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C13.351.500.365.700'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.553.355'], ['B03.440.400.425.550.550.474', 'B03.660.075.525.520.400'], ['C01.635.500', 'C13.351.500.056.750'], ['C23.888.592.612.944'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C01.221.812', 'C01.778', 'C12.294.668', 'C13.351.500.711', 'C23.550.291.531.937'], ['A05.360.319.779']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
10350,[Experience on the treatment of acute anorectal abscess with primary fistulotomy].,"From August 1985 to July 1989, 72 cases with initial attacks of acute cryptoglandular anorectal abscesses were hospitalized and treated in Kuang Tien General Hospital. Among them were 52 cases of the perianal type, 8 of the intersphincteric type, 11 of the ischiorectal type and one case involving the supralevator space. Included were 62 males and 10 females (sex ratio 6:1) with a mean age of 39 years (range, 18 to 63). The mean duration of the follow-up was 24 months. Most anorectal abscesses originate from a cryptoglandular infection and are usually treated initially by incision and drainage. However, a fistula operation may be required if a fistula develops weeks or months later. Several published papers from various hospitals have also pointed out that this disease condition can be successfully treated by a one-stage operation-primary fistulotomy. In order to determine the source of infection, careful examination was carried out in the operating room under adequate anesthesia. A definite or at least a highly suspected offending crypt was found in 57 cases, all of whom were treated by primary fistulotomy. The remaining 15 cases whose offending crypts were undetectable, were treated by incision and drainage. Of the 57 cases treated with primary fistulotomy, four cases developed recurrent abscesses or fistulas. In the incision and drainage group, five cases developed recurrences.

519,Impact of human immunodeficiency virus infection on the prevalence and severity of steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although steatosis is strongly associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, little is known about this finding in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence and severity of steatosis in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing liver biopsy were prospectively identified and were interviewed to obtain detailed demographic and clinical data. Steatosis was scored according to the percentage of hepatocytes involved: 0 (none), 1 (<33%), 2 (33-66%), or 3 (>66%); fibrosis was scored on a scale from 0 to 4.RESULTS: A total of 708 patients were enrolled, including 154 with HIV/HCV coinfection and 554 with HCV monoinfection. Steatosis of any grade (72.1 vs. 52.0%, P<0.001), grade 2/3 steatosis (48.1 vs. 20.2%, P<0.001), and stage 3/4 fibrosis (43.5 vs. 30.0%, P=0.002) were significantly more common in coinfected patients. Compared to HCV monoinfected subjects, HIV/HCV coinfection was associated with a significantly increased odds of steatosis of any grade (OR=3.21; 95% CI, 1.84-5.60) and grade 2/3 steatosis (OR=5.63; 95% CI, 3.05-10.36) after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Among coinfected patients, the fibrosis progression rate increased in a linear fashion with the grade of steatosis.CONCLUSIONS: Steatosis is more common and more severe in HIV/HCV coinfected patients than in those with HCV monoinfection.","['Fatty Liver', 'Female', 'HIV Infections', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'United States']",16618518,"[['C06.552.241'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['C01.221.250.750.120', 'C01.925.440.440.120', 'C01.925.782.350.350.120', 'C06.552.380.350.120', 'C06.552.380.705.440.120'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.552.630', 'C23.550.355.412'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
48212,Pseudo-rearrangement of the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23: a cautionary note on genotype analysis of leukaemia patients.,"AIMS: The MLL gene on chromosome 11q23 is frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations in association with haematological malignancies. Recently, a specific site within the 8.3 kb MLL break-point cluster region that is cleaved during the early stages of apoptosis has been identified. Because MLL gene rearrangements are used to identify patients with high risk leukaemia, it was the aim of this study to determine whether this DNA cleavage event could be triggered in diagnostic bone marrow samples solely through ex vivo incubation at room temperature.METHODS: Pretreatment bone marrow samples were collected from six paediatric leukaemia patients. Genomic DNA for Southern blot analysis of MLL gene rearrangements was isolated immediately after samples were obtained and compared to genomic DNA isolated after incubation of specimens for 24-60 hours at room temperature, simulating delays in processing that might occur when samples are delivered to reference laboratories. In addition, cryopreserved samples from 70 paediatric leukaemia patients were screened for evidence of site specific MLL cleavage.RESULTS: After ex vivo incubation of bone marrow samples, site specific MLL cleavage resulting in a pseudo-rearrangement of the MLL gene was detected in two of six patients. In addition, a third patient with a similar MLL pseudo-rearrangement in cryopreserved cells was identified.CONCLUSIONS: Pseudo-rearrangement of the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23 was caused by ex vivo incubation of bone marrow samples. This novel phenomenon, which could lead to misclassification of leukaemia patients, might also be of importance for genotype analysis by Southern blotting at other loci.","['Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cryopreservation', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Specimen Handling', 'Transcription Factors', 'Zinc Fingers']",9713591,"[['E05.196.401.114', 'E05.301.300.087', 'E05.601.150'], ['A15.382.216'], ['M01.060.406'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.325.355', 'G05.360.162.520.300.325.355'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.160', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.160', 'E02.792.156', 'E05.200.500.620.760.160', 'E05.200.750.600.760.160', 'E05.760.156'], ['E05.481.500'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G05.344'], ['D08.811.913.555.500.800.200.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['C04.557.337'], ['D12.776.260.560', 'D12.776.624.664.700.148', 'D12.776.930.483'], ['D12.776.624'], ['C04.557.337.428.600', 'C15.604.515.560.600', 'C20.683.515.528.600'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500.791'], ['E01.370.225.998', 'E05.200.998'], ['D12.776.930'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500.985']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
44493,Factors associated with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether menstrual abnormalities, multiple personal behaviors and some contraceptive methods, all of which have been described as potential causes of single episodes of bacterial vaginosis (BV), are associated with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (RBV).STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective, case-controlled study performed in an urban setting. Women with RBV and matched controls were mailed a survey that included multiple questions about potential risk factors for BV. Four-to-one matching of age groups was performed, with 28 RBV cases matched to 112 controls.RESULTS: Among multiple possible predisposing factors, only African American ethnicity (p < 0.001) and > 1 male sex partner in the previous 2 years (p = 0.007) were strongly associated with RBV. Abnormal uterine bleeding, frequent intercourse without a condom or withdrawal, anal intercourse, menstrual hygiene product use, tub baths, back-to-front wiping after using the toilet, smoking, choice of contraceptive method (including condoms, the combination oral contraceptive, injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate or an intrauterine device) and douching were not associated with RBV.CONCLUSION: Providers should counsel women with RBV to minimize their number of male sex partners. There are few data to support the recommendation of other behavioral changes.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Contraception', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Urban Population', 'Vaginosis, Bacterial', 'Young Adult']",20337209,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.686.508.100.100', 'M01.686.754.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E02.875.194'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['F01.145.488'], ['E05.318.308.980.438', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.802'], ['M01.778'], ['N01.600.900'], ['C01.150.252.954', 'C13.351.500.894.906.800'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

A sample of 352 persons, 179 men and 173 women randomly selected from the local community register, age 20-79 years underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. For men age < 50 daytime ambulatory blood pressure (median) was 125/79 mmHg and night time was 106/65 mmHg, for women the respective pressures were 113/77 mmHg and 97/64 mmHg. For men age > or = 50 daytime ambulatory blood pressure was 133/83 mmHg and night time was 124/86 mmHg, for women the respective pressures were 122/83 mmHg and 105/65 mmHg. Presently, we can only relate cardiovascular risk to clinic blood pressure. Therefore we have calculated corresponding ambulatory blood pressure values to WHO's upper limit 160/90 mmHg for normal blood pressure in the clinic and found 154/87 mmHg for daytime and 134/74 mmHg at night. For a clinic pressure of 95 mmHg the corresponding daytime value was 91 mmHg, for 100 mmHg it was 95 mmHg.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reference Values']",8999617,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.370.140.100', 'E01.370.520.500.100'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['Z01.542.816.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.978.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
11017,Relationship between corneal dellen and tearfilm breakup time.,"The BUT of 51 strabismus patients were measured before and after operation. The average pre-op BUT was 28.75 seconds (10.96""-91.80""). The post-op BUT in all operated eyes were reduced significantly, no matter what procedures had been performed and whether dellen appeared or not (P < 0.01). The BUT in the group complicated dellen reduced from 23.22"" (pre-op) to 8.61"" (post-op). The incidence of dellen was 22.54% in this study. The incidence of dellen after rectus resection procedure (47.75%) was much higher than that after rectus recession (5.13%) (P < 0.01). This study showed that dellen was closely related to the BUT and occurred more often in the eyes on which resection procedure was performed. It is considered that excessive lacrimation and elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva near the limbus may disturb the stability of the precornea tearfilm and cause the tearfilm break up earlier. Local corneal dehydration and dellen formation may be caused by reduced BUT. The incidence of dellen after operation may be higher if the cornea was carefully observed.","['Corneal Diseases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Strabismus', 'Tears', 'Time Factors']",1843130,"[['C11.204'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.767'], ['C10.292.562.887', 'C11.590.810'], ['A12.200.882'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In this study, the effect of three galanin antagonists were tested on the pressor response to an intravenous dose (6.3 nmol/kg) of porcine galanin in anaesthetised Cane toads, Bufo marinus. Antagonists were injected at either 20 or 50 times the molar dose (x MD) of galanin. The antagonist, C7 (Galanin 1-13-spantide) reduced the pressor effect of galanin by 32.2 +/- 6.0% when delivered at 20 x MD (n = 4) and by 42.9 +/- 15.7% when delivered at 50 x MD (n = 4) of galanin, the response recovering within 30 min. A second antagonist, M32a (Galanin 1-13-NPY 24-36) had no effect on the pressor response to galanin at 20 x MD (n = 4), but significantly reduced the pressor effect by 54.8 +/- 6.4% at 50 x MD (n = 5), which also recovered within 30 min. Administration of a third antagonist, galantide or M15 (Galanin 1-13-Substance P5-11), resulted in a profound drop in blood pressure, and did not affect the response to galanin at either dose.

1737,Risk factors in community-acquired chronic hepatitis C virus infection: a case-control study in Italy.,"AIMS/METHODS: A case-control study was carried out in Italy to assess the risk factors associated with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Five hundred consecutive chronic anti-hepatitis C virus positive cases and 500 sex and exactly age-matched anti-hepatitis C virus negative/HBsAg negative controls entered the study. Information was collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The adjusted Odds Ratios linking hepatitis C virus infection and risk factors were estimated by conditional multiple logistic regression. Demographic and socio-economic characteristics were similar in cases and controls. Seventy-five percent of patients were aged over 40: males were prominent in the group < or = 40, while the number of females increased with age.RESULTS: As expected, drug addiction and blood transfusion emerged as independent risk factors: blood transfusion in all ages and in both sexes, drug addiction only in subjects under 41 years and mostly in males. Other risk factors independently associated with hepatitis C virus infection were: previous use of non-disposable needles, previous tuberculosis, and prolonged hospitalization before 1970. A history of sexually-transmitted diseases was not associated.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the great spread of hepatitis C virus in Italy may have occurred several years ago through parenteral routes which are not now operating. Modern hygienic and sanitation measures have significantly controlled exposure to the infection, which in the younger generations is confined to high-risk groups such as drug addicts.","['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Female', 'Hepatitis C', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution']",8907564,"[['M01.060.116'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['C01.234'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.542.489'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['I01.240.800', 'N01.224.803', 'N06.850.505.400.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
1469,Spinal 2-chloroprocaine: a comparison with procaine in volunteers.,"Recent studies using preservative-free 2-chloroprocaine (2-CP) for spinal anesthesia have shown it to be a reliable short-acting drug that provides similar anesthesia to lidocaine. In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we compared the characteristics of spinal 2-CP (30 mg) with those of procaine (80 mg) in eight volunteers to determine whether either drug produces spinal anesthetic characteristics ideal for outpatient surgery. By using sensation to pinprick, transcutaneous electrical stimulation, tolerance to thigh tourniquet, and motor blockade as surrogates for surgical efficacy, 2-CP compared similarly to procaine. Peak block height (T9 [range, T6 to T12] versus T6 [T4 to T8]; P = 0.0796), time to two-segment regression (51 +/- 17 min versus 53 +/- 10 min; P = 0.7434), tourniquet time tolerance (37 +/- 16 versus 49 min +/- 17 min; P = 0.1755), and time to return of motor strength (Bromage scale: 54 +/- 23 min versus 55 +/- 44 min, P = 0.9366; return of 90% quadriceps strength: 78 +/- 9 min versus 98 +/- 30 min; P = 0.0721) were all similar. Procaine did produce overall longer sensory blockade (P = 0.0011) and motor blockade at the gastrocnemius (P = 0.0004) and quadriceps (P = 0.0146) muscles. Times until the resolution of sensory blockade (103 +/- 12 min versus 151 +/- 26 min; P = 0.0003), ambulation (103 +/- 12 min versus 151 +/- 26 min; P = 0.0003), and micturition (103 +/- 12 min versus 156 +/- 23 min; P < 0.0001) were all prolonged after procaine. In conclusion, at the doses tested, spinal 2-CP (30 mg) may be a better choice for short outpatient procedures because it provides anesthesia with similar efficacy as procaine (80 mg) but with more rapid fulfillment of discharge criteria.","['Adult', 'Anesthesia, Spinal', 'Anesthetics, Local', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Oximetry', 'Pain Measurement', 'Procaine', 'Prospective Studies', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Bladder']",15673896,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E03.155.086.331'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E05.723.402'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G11.427.494.472'], ['G11.427.494'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.100.600', 'E01.370.370.380.600', 'E01.370.386.700.100.600', 'E05.200.124.100.100.600'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['D02.241.223.100.050.500.906', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.020.937.906'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E01.370.350.850'], ['A05.810.890']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
12987,New mutation of the myelin P0 gene in a pedigree of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy 1.,"P0, the major structural protein of peripheral myelin, is a homophilic adhesion molecule with a single immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, which contains a single N-linked glycosylation site and two cysteines. We have previously reported four different mutations of the myelin P0 gene in four families of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1 (CMT1). In this study we found a new mutation of the myelin P0 gene in a small family of CMT1. The affected persons had an A - to - G substitution of nucleotide 245 of the myelin P0 gene in one allele, leading to a cysteine substitution for tyrosine82 in the extracellular Ig-domain. An additional cysteine in the extracellular domain may form a disulfide bond and cause an inappropriate change in the tertiary structure of the functional Ig-domain of P0.","['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myelin P0 Protein', 'Myelin Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",7505151,"[['M01.060.057'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.250', 'D12.776.543.550.200.250', 'D23.050.301.350.250'], ['C10.500.300.200', 'C10.574.500.495.200', 'C10.668.829.800.300.200', 'C16.131.666.300.200', 'C16.320.400.375.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.250.500', 'D12.776.395.570', 'D12.776.543.550.200.250.500', 'D12.776.543.620.570', 'D12.776.631.580.550', 'D23.050.301.350.250.500'], ['D12.776.543.620', 'D12.776.631.580'], ['E05.393.620.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
44814,Outside-in signaling from integrin alpha IIb beta 3 into platelets in the absence of agonist-induced signaling.,"Platelet agonists generate intracellular signals which lead to activation of the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (integrin alpha IIb beta 3). The resulting occupancy of alpha IIb beta 3 by ligands also generates signals into the cell (outside-in signaling). We reported previously that unlike platelet agonists, the F(ab')2 fragments of an anti-alpha IIb beta 3 monoclonal antibody, PMA4, induced fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3 without causing intracellular activation. In this study, in order to determine whether outside-in signaling occurs in the absence of agonist-induced intracellular signals, we used PMA4 F(ab')2 as an inducer of fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3. PMA4 F(ab')2-induced fibrinogen binding and subsequent platelet aggregation triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including pp72syk but not pp125FAK. No Ca2+ influx or mobilization, thromboxane B2 synthesis, phosphorylation of pleckstrin or the myosin light chain, cytoplasmic alkalinization, or platelet shape changes, were detected. These findings suggest that, in the absence of agonist-induced signaling, alpha IIb beta 3 occupied by soluble fibrinogen generates only a limited outside-in signal.","['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blood Platelets', 'Calcium', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Enzyme Precursors', 'Fibrinogen', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tyrosine']",9195778,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['A11.118.188', 'A15.145.229.188'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D12.776.395.550.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200', 'D23.050.301.350'], ['D08.622', 'D12.776.811.243'], ['D12.776.124.050.250', 'D12.776.124.125.500', 'D12.776.811.300', 'D23.119.490'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.049.500', 'D12.776.744.493'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.049', 'D12.644.360.287', 'D12.776.476.287'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.541.500.650', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650'], ['D12.644.360', 'D12.776.476'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G09.188.390.600'], ['D12.776.395.550.625.785', 'D12.776.543.550.625.785', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.460.700', 'D12.776.543.750.705.675.784'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.650', 'D12.644.360.900', 'D12.776.476.913'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.825.810', 'D10.251.355.310.166.971.810'], ['D12.125.072.050.875']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
22318,A microfluidic platform for pharmaceutical salt screening.,"We describe a microfluidic platform comprised of 48 wells to screen for pharmaceutical salts. Solutions of pharmaceutical parent compounds (PCs) and salt formers (SFs) are mixed on-chip in a combinatorial fashion in arrays of 87.5-nanolitre wells, which constitutes a drastic reduction of the volume of PC solution needed per condition screened compared to typical high throughput pharmaceutical screening approaches. Nucleation and growth of salt crystals is induced by diffusive and/or convective mixing of solutions containing, respectively, PCs and SFs in a variety of solvents. To enable long term experiments, solvent loss was minimized by reducing the thickness of the absorptive polymeric material, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and by using solvent impermeable top and bottom layers. Additionally, well isolation was enhanced via the incorporation of pneumatic valves that are closed at rest. Brightfield and polarized light microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used for on-chip analysis and crystal identification. Using a gold-coated glass substrate and minimizing the thickness of the PDMS control layer drastically improved the signal-to-noise ratio for Raman spectra. Two drugs, naproxen (acid) and ephedrine (base), were used for validation of the platform's ability to screen for salts. Each PC was mixed combinatorially with potential SFs in a variety of solvents. Crystals were visualized using brightfield polarized light microscopy. Subsequent on-chip analyses of the crystals with Raman spectroscopy identified four different naproxen salts and five different ephedrine salts.","['Dimethylpolysiloxanes', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Ephedrine', 'Equipment Design', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Naproxen', 'Optical Phenomena', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Salts', 'Solvents', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman']",21956673,"[['D02.756.650.700.150', 'D05.750.900.850.150', 'D25.720.900.850.150', 'J01.637.051.720.900.850.150'], ['E05.290.750', 'E05.337.550'], ['D02.033.100.624.302', 'D02.033.755.624.302', 'D02.092.063.624.302', 'D02.092.471.683.430'], ['E05.320'], ['E05.588.465'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.638.472.500', 'D04.615.638.472.450'], ['G01.590'], ['D26'], ['D01.786'], ['D27.720.844'], ['E05.196.822.860', 'E05.196.867.890']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
29077,The role of hyaluronan in mesothelium-induced motility of ovarian carcinoma cells.,"BACKGROUND: Ovarian carcinoma metastases occur when the malignant cells establish new colonies on the peritoneal surface. This study was undertaken to determine whether mesothelial cell hyaluronan affects tumor cell motility.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four ovarian carcinoma cell lines (UCI 101, UCI 107, OC 222 and NIH:OVCAR-3) were allowed to migrate toward cultures of mesothelial cells and different concentrations of hyaluronan. Mesothelial hyaluronan production in the presence of the ovarian carcinoma cells was assayed.RESULTS: The carcinoma lines showed greater motility toward mesothelial cells than controls, but the increased motility was abolished by hyaluronidase. Co-cultures of mesothelial cells and ovarian carcinoma cell lines produced up to twice as much hyaluronan as mesothelial cells alone. Purified hyaluronan induced dose-dependent and chemotactic motility in all carcinoma lines.CONCLUSION: These results are evidence that mesothelial hyaluronan is a potential paracrine motility factor for ovarian carcinoma. The presence of mesothelial cells on the peritoneal cavity may encourage the establishment of ovarian carcinoma metastases.","['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemotaxis', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronic Acid', 'Hyaluronoglucosaminidase', 'Ovarian Neoplasms']",14666707,"[['G04.022'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['F01.145.113.780.500', 'F01.145.875.439.500.500', 'G04.198.424', 'G07.568.500.590.500', 'G11.427.410.568.850.500'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['A11.436'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D09.698.373.475'], ['D08.811.277.450.529', 'D08.811.520.241.700.675'], ['C04.588.322.455', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705', 'C13.351.937.418.685', 'C19.344.410', 'C19.391.630.705']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41328,Effects of thyroid hormone on GLUT4 glucose transporter gene expression and NIDDM in rats.,"Previous studies have shown that T3 coordinately stimulates GLUT4-glucose transporter messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in mixed fiber-type skeletal muscle of the rat and produces a concomitant elevation in basal (noninsulin mediated) glucose uptake. The aim of the present study was to 1) determine the precise mechanism(s) for the T3-induced expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, and 2) investigate the potential benefits of T3 on noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Ten daily ip injections of T3 (100 micrograms/100 g BW) administered to hypothyroid male Sprague-Dawley rats, increased both GLUT4 mRNA and transcription approximately 70% (P < 0.05) in mixed fiber-type hindlimb skeletal muscle. Transcriptional induction was subsequently defined to be restricted to red (oxidative) muscle fibers (2.5-fold; P < 0.05), whereas GLUT4 protein was increased in both red and white (glycolytic) skeletal muscle. GLUT4 mRNA and protein expression were similarly inducible in the skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant Zucker rats. More importantly, T3 treatment totally ameliorated hyperinsulinemia in obese animals (P < 0.001), although their moderately elevated plasma glucose levels were not significantly altered. In conclusion, regulation of GLUT4 expression by T3 was shown to lie at the transcriptional level in red skeletal muscle, whereas in white muscle fiber types, it appears to operate via an alternative posttranscriptional mechanism. These data also support the potential of hormonally inducing glucose transporter expression in insulin-resistant muscle. However, high levels of T3 are associated with a number of adverse side-effects, in particular the stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Nevertheless, future studies may demonstrate, e.g. subthyrotoxic levels, to be similarly effective but without side effects, and thus perhaps find a clinical application in reducing both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in NIDDM.","['Animals', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Gene Expression', 'Glucose Transporter Type 4', 'Hindlimb', 'Hyperinsulinism', 'Male', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Obesity', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rats, Zucker', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Triiodothyronine']",9048628,"[['B01.050'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['G05.297'], ['D12.776.157.530.500.500.937', 'D12.776.157.530.937.563.937', 'D12.776.543.585.500.500.937', 'D12.776.543.585.937.625.937'], ['A13.473'], ['C18.452.394.968'], ['D12.776.157.530.500', 'D12.776.543.585.500'], ['A10.690.552.500.500', 'A11.620.249'], ['D12.776.210.500'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.550.700'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D06.472.931.740.385', 'D12.125.072.050.767.741.894']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15373,Intravenous magnesium sulfate for the treatment of acute asthma in the emergency department.,"Conventional nebulized beta-agonist therapy has met with disappointing results in an increasing number of moderate to severe asthmatics who may be characterized as ""poor responders."" Thirty-eight patients suffering from acute exacerbations of moderate to severe asthma were treated in an emergency department with an intravenous infusion of saline placebo or 1.2 g of magnesium sulfate after conventional beta-agonist therapy failed to produce significant improvement in peak expiratory flow rate. Nineteen patients were randomized into each of two groups in a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.

28099,A novel fiber composite ingredient incorporated into a beverage and bar blunts postprandial serum glucose and insulin responses: a randomized controlled trial.,"Previous research supports that consumption of resistant starch and guar gum independently influences insulin-mediated glucose responses to meals. This research assessed a novel co-processed fiber composite (FC) ingredient comprising whole-grain high-amylose maize flour and viscous guar gum on glucose and insulin responses to co-consumed and subsequent meals in humans. It was hypothesized that a smoothie-type beverage or a cold-pressed snack bar containing the FC would blunt and sustain serum glucose and insulin postprandial responses compared with maltodextrin (MD). The beverage and bar were assessed in 2 separate studies using identical protocols. Young, nondiabetic, nonobese adults participated in 2 testing days (randomized crossover design) separated by at least 1 week for both food forms. On each testing day, the FC or MD product was consumed with a low-fiber standardized breakfast followed by a low-fiber standardized lunch (with no FC or MD) 4 hours later. Blood samples were collected at baseline and incrementally throughout the 8-hour testing day. One-tailed paired t tests were performed to compare treatment areas under the curve, and a doubly repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to compare treatment responses at individual time points (P< .05, Bonferroni corrected). The FC blunted the postprandial glucose and insulin responses compared with MD, including a robust glucose and insulin response reduction after breakfast and a continued modest glycemic second-meal reduction after lunch in both the beverage and the bar. These findings support the use of this novel whole-grain FC ingredient in a beverage or bar for insulin-mediated glucose control in young healthy adults.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amylose', 'Beverages', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Flour', 'Galactans', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Male', 'Mannans', 'Meals', 'Plant Gums', 'Polysaccharides', 'Postprandial Period', 'Whole Grains', 'Young Adult', 'Zea mays']",26923512,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D09.301.915.361', 'D09.698.365.855.361'], ['G07.203.100', 'J02.200'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['D09.301.416', 'G07.203.300.400', 'J02.500.400'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['G07.203.300.484', 'J02.500.484'], ['D09.698.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['D09.698.550'], ['G07.203.300.590', 'J02.500.590'], ['D05.750.078.739', 'D09.698.700', 'D20.215.721.249'], ['D09.698'], ['G10.261.700'], ['G07.203.300.300.550.500', 'G07.203.300.775.500.500', 'J02.500.300.550.500', 'J02.500.775.500.500'], ['M01.060.116.815'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.966']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

These sequences are regulated in a cell-specific manner. (i) In NIH 3T3 cells, the CArG box of the c-fos promoter is sufficient to mediate activation by oncogenes. (ii) In contrast, in HeLa cells, additional flanking sequences are also required, including the outer arm of the serum response element and the FAP site. We also show that the serum response factor, which binds to the CArG box, activates transcription in vivo in NIH 3T3 cells but not in HeLa cells.

3081,A naturally occurring gamma globin gene mutation enhances SP1 binding activity.,"Transcription of the human fetal globin genes in erythroid cells is tightly regulated during different stages of development and differentiation. Two naturally occurring mutations 202 base pairs upstream of the duplicated gamma globin genes are associated with incorrectly regulated gamma globin gene gene expression; elevated levels of fetal globin are synthesized during adult life. A C-to-G base substitution upstream of the G gamma-globin gene is highly correlated with a dramatic increase in gene expression. It increases the similarity of the region to the consensus Sp1 recognition site. We determined that the mutated DNA had a 5- to 10-fold-higher affinity for Sp1 than did normal gamma globin gene sequence. We also observed a reduction in normal factor-binding activity. A different substitution at -202, C to T, upstream of the A gamma-globin gene was associated with a more moderate increase in fetal globin expression. This mutation decreased the similarity of the sequence to an Sp1 recognition site. We determined that it did not result in enhanced Sp1 binding but did alter normal factor binding. We suggest that these changes in nuclear protein-binding properties detected in vitro are responsible for the enhanced gamma globin gene expression found in -202 G gamma beta + patients with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.","['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian virus 40', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1688466,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['D12.776.260'], ['D12.776.124.400.303', 'D12.776.422.316.762.320'], ['G05.308'], ['D12.776.422.316'], ['C15.378.420', 'C16.320.365'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D13.444.600.601', 'D27.505.259.750.600.650', 'D27.720.470.530.600.650'], ['G02.111.570.080.689', 'G05.360.080.689'], ['B04.280.210.700.615.700', 'B04.613.204.670.615.700'], ['D12.776.260.522.750.249', 'D12.776.930.375.750.249'], ['D12.776.930'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

12297,Mutational analysis of bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase: role of motif IV in ligation catalysis.,"The bacterial DNA ligase as a multiple domain protein is involved in DNA replication, repair and recombination. Its catalysis of ligation can be divided into three steps. To delineate the roles of amino acid residues in motif IV in ligation catalysis, site-directed mutants were constructed in a bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase from Thermus sp. TAK16D. It was shown that four conserved residues (D286, G287, V289 and K291) in motif IV had significant roles on the overall ligation. Under single turnover conditions, the observed apparent rates of D286E, G287A, V289I and K291R mutants were clearly reduced compared with that of WT ligase on both match and mismatch nicked substrates. The effects of D286E mutation on overall ligation may not only be ascribed to the third step. The G287A mutation has a major effect on the second step. The effects of V289I and K291R mutation on overall ligation are not on the third step, perhaps other aspects, such as conformation change of ligase protein in ligation catalysis, are involved. Moreover, the amino acid substitutions of above four residues were more sensitive on mismatch nicked substrate, indicating an enhanced ligation fidelity.","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Pair Mismatch', 'Base Sequence', 'Catalysis', 'DNA Ligases', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli', 'Kinetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thermus', 'Transformation, Genetic']",17687496,"[['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500', 'G02.111.570.820.709.600.500'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G05.365.590.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.130'], ['D08.811.074.500', 'D08.811.464.754.600'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['G02.111.835'], ['B03.440.400.425.875'], ['G05.728.865']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
3516,Mental action simulation synchronizes action-observation circuits across individuals.,"A frontoparietal action-observation network (AON) has been proposed to support understanding others' actions and goals. We show that the AON ""ticks together"" in human subjects who are sharing a third person's feelings. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 20 volunteers watched movies depicting boxing matches passively or while simulating a prespecified boxer's feelings. Instantaneous intersubject phase synchronization (ISPS) was computed to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity of hemodynamic activity and inter-area functional connectivity. During passive viewing, subjects' brain activity was synchronized in sensory projection and posterior temporal cortices. Simulation induced widespread increase of ISPS in the AON (premotor, posterior parietal, and superior temporal cortices), primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, and the dorsal attention circuits (frontal eye fields, intraparietal sulcus). Moreover, interconnectivity of these regions strengthened during simulation. We propose that sharing a third person's feelings synchronizes the observer's own brain mechanisms supporting sensations and motor planning, thereby likely promoting mutual understanding.","['Adult', 'Brain', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Individuality', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mental Processes', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Net', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Young Adult']",24431433,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A08.186.211'], ['F01.470'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.488'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['F02.463'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A08.511'], ['E05.318.372.250.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.500'], ['E05.723.729'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
41833,"Divergence in nonspecific hydrophobic packing interactions in the apo state, and its possible role in functional specialization of mitochondrial and microsomal cytochrome b5.","The outer mitochondrial membrane isoform of mammalian cytochrome b(5) (OM b(5)) is distinguished from the microsomal isoform (Mc b(5)) by its considerably greater stability. In contrast, OM and Mc apocytochrome b(5) (apo-b(5)) exhibit similar thermodynamic stability. Contributing substantially to the greater stability of OM b(5) relative to that of Mc b(5) is the presence of Leu at position 71. Replacing Leu-71 in OM b(5) with the corresponding Mc b(5) residue (Ser) not only diminishes holoprotein stability but also markedly compromises apoprotein stability. The studies reported herein were undertaken to clarify the role played by Leu-71 in stabilizing OM b(5)s relative to Mc b(5)s, and were motivated by the possibility that stability is related to other differences in OM and Mc b(5) properties that are important for their specialized subcellular roles. The results of these studies show that Leu-71 plays an essential role in maintaining the structural integrity of the heme-independent folding core of OM apo-b(5) (core 2), despite its location in the disordered empty heme-binding pocket (core 1). The conformational integrity of core 2 in Mc apo-b(5)s is not similarly dependent on the presence of a hydrophobic residue at position 71, providing new evidence for evolution of compensating structural features not present in OM b(5)s. We propose that Leu-71 achieves its effect on OM apo-b(5) core 2 structure by participating in a nonspecific hydrophobic collapse of disordered core 1, templated by more conformationally restricted side chains of residues in the beta-sheet that separates the two cores. We hypothesize that this has the added effect of maintaining core 1 of OM apo-b(5)s in a state more compact than that which occurs in Mc apo-b(5)s, possibly contributing to stronger heme binding by limiting the number of non-native conformations that the empty heme-binding pocket can populate.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Cytochromes b5', 'Microsomes', 'Mitochondria', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment']",16262260,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.196.309.742.225'], ['D08.244.187.500', 'D12.776.422.220.187.500'], ['A11.284.835.540'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G01.154.651.750.500', 'G02.111.688.750.500'], ['D12.776.800'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.600'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.776.828'], ['E05.393.751']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
14110,Adolescent bisphenol-A exposure decreases dendritic spine density: role of sex and age.,"Bisphenol-A (BPA), a common environmental endocrine disruptor, modulates estrogenic, androgenic, and antiandrogenic effects throughout the lifespan. We recently showed that low dose BPA exposure during adolescence increases anxiety and impairs spatial memory independent of sex. In this study, six week old Sprague Dawley rats (n=24 males, n=24 females) received daily subcutaneous injections (40 µg/kg bodyweight) of BPA or vehicle for one week. Serum corticosterone levels in response to a 1 h restraint stress and spine density were examined at age 7 (cohort 1) and 11 (cohort 2) weeks. Adolescent BPA exposure did not alter stress dependent corticosterone responses but decreased spine density on apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal CA1 region (CA1). Sex differences in spine density were observed on basal dendrites of the mPFC and CA1 with females having greater spine density than males. This sex difference was further augmented by both age and treatment, with results indicating that BPA-dependent decreases in spine density were more pronounced in males than females on mPFC basal dendrites. Importantly, the robust neuronal alterations were observed in animals exposed to BPA levels below the current U.S.E.P.A. recommended safe daily limit. These results are the first demonstrating that BPA given during adolescence leads to enduring effects on neural morphology at adulthood. Given that humans are routinely exposed to low levels of BPA through a variety of sources, the decreased spine density reported in both male and female rats after BPA exposure warrants further investigation.","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Benzhydryl Compounds', 'CA1 Region, Hippocampal', 'Corticosterone', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Female', 'Male', 'Phenols', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sex Factors']",24975924,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.115'], ['A08.186.211.180.405.099', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.345.099'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.237', 'D06.472.040.585.353.237'], ['A08.675.256.200', 'A11.284.180.225.169', 'A11.671.240.169'], ['D27.505.696.353', 'D27.888.141'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270.700'], ['A08.675.790', 'A11.671.790'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
21054,Validity and reliability of a quality-of-life instrument: the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire.,"A pilot study was done to evaluate criterion-related validity and test-retest reliability of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ examines how chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) effects quality of life, and evaluates four dimensions: dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, and mastery. The pilot study did not establish validity. One of the dimensions, mastery, did not correlate with any of the criterion instruments. Reliability was demonstrated when the instrument was retested after 9 days. The recommendation, based on this research, is that the CRQ may be useful in clinical settings, but not for research.","['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internal-External Control', 'Lung Diseases, Obstructive', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",8173519,"[['E02.760.169.063.500.067', 'E02.831.067', 'I03.050', 'N02.421.784.110'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.379'], ['C08.381.495'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

The data represent a valuable baseline from which to assess the effects of the environmental factors in the deep-underground on human physiology, psychology, and pathology.The air pressure, relative humidity, temperature, total ã radiation dose-rate, and oxygen concentration in the CJEM in the aisles in goafs at 4 depths below ground were measured. Study subjects were administered a study-specific questionnaire that included items that targeted factors with potential to affect respondents' health and wellbeing and included the symptom checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R).Air pressure, relative humidity, and temperature rose, total ã radiation dose-rate decreased, and there was no change in oxygen concentration with increasing depth below ground. Most (97.2%) respondents had a negative impression of the ambient conditions in the deep-underground space. The most commonly perceived adverse factors included moisture (74.9%), heat (33.5%), and poor ventilation (32.4%). 93.29% of respondents associated ?1 self-reported negative physical symptom with working in the deep-underground space; the most frequent symptoms were being easily tired (48.7%), tinnitus (47.5%), and hearing loss (44.1%).

We randomly sampled 12,000 veterans with heart failure diagnosed in 2010. The topic modeling method was applied to identify frailty-related topics from the clinical notes in the electronic medical records. The frailty topics were classified into five deficit areas including physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), general health (GH), social functioning (SF), and mental health (MH). We experimented with different covariates and four different frailty measures: individual frailty topics, number of distinct frailty topics, a dichotomous deficit category, and the number of distinct deficits, respectively. A total of 8,531 (71.1%) patients had at least one frailty topic. The prevalence of GH, PF, MH, SF, and RP deficits were 89.0%, 61.3%, 56.9%, 40.6%, and 9.5%, respectively. PF deficits (yes/no) and the number of distinct deficits were the most consistent, significant predictors of adverse outcomes of rehosptalization or death.","['Aged', 'Frail Elderly', 'Frailty', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Heart Failure', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Prevalence']",29295109,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.540'], ['C23.550.359'], ['E05.318.308.225', 'I01.240.425.350', 'N01.224.425.350', 'N05.715.360.300.360', 'N06.850.505.400.425.350', 'N06.850.520.308.225'], ['C14.280.434'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.418', 'N01.400.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
22337,Uric Acid Levels Correlate with Sensory Nerve Function in Healthy Subjects.,"BACKGROUND: High levels of uric acid (UA) are associated with various peripheral neuropathies. Furthermore, uric acid levels have been found to correlate with both the clinical and electrophysiological severity of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy, mainly with sensory functions.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether higher UA levels are associated negatively with nerve function in healthy subjects.METHODS: A total of 126 healthy subjects recruited prospectively for another study were included. We extracted demographic data, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score (TCNS), electrophysiological findings, vibration perception thresholds (VPT), and laboratory test results including UA, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and lipid levels.RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 56 ± 17 years with 56% females. Males had higher UA values compared with females. Univariate beta regression coefficient analysis between UA levels and demographic, clinical, electrophysiological, and laboratory findings showed significant positive correlations with male gender, components of the metabolic syndrome, and with VPT, while an inverse correlation was found with electrophysiological sensory parameters. A multivariate regression model showed positive correlations only with BMI, finger VPT, and triglycerides.CONCLUSION: Higher UA levels correlate with lower sensory nerve function in healthy subjects, expanding the evidence of possible negative influence of UA on peripheral nerves, although a causative role has not yet established.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Sensation', 'Sensory Thresholds', 'Uric Acid']",30880660,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.774.500', 'M01.955.236'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A08.800.800'], ['F02.830.816', 'G11.561.790'], ['F02.463.593.710'], ['D03.132.960.877', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824.877']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
6191,Cost-utility analysis comparing meropenem with imipenem plus cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in intensive care.,"This study compared the cost-effectiveness of meropenem with that of imipenem plus cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in hospital intensive care in the UK. A Markov model was constructed to model lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of using meropenem and imipenem plus cilastatin for the treatment of severe infections in intensive care. Estimates of effectiveness, utility weights and costs were obtained from the published literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Estimated treatment costs for the patient cohort were pound 14,938 with meropenem and pound 15,585 with imipenem plus cilastatin. QALYs gained were 7,495 with meropenem and 7,413 with imipenem plus cilastatin. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed meropenem to be significantly less costly (-pound 636.47, 95% CI -pound 132.33 to -pound 1,140.62) and more effective (0.084, 95% CI 0.023 to 0.144).

15707,Bridging across length scales: multi-scale ordering of supported lipid bilayers via lipoprotein self-assembly and surface patterning.,"We show that a two-step process, involving spontaneous self-assembly of lipids and apolipoproteins and surface patterning, produces single, supported lipid bilayers over two discrete and independently adjustable length scales. Specifically, an aqueous phase incubation of DMPC vesicles with purified apolipoprotein A-I results in the reconstitution of high density lipoprotein (rHDL), wherein nanoscale clusters of single lipid bilayers are corralled by the protein. Adsorption of these discoidal particles to clean hydrophilic glass (or silicon) followed by direct exposure to a spatial pattern of short-wavelength UV radiation directly produces microscopic patterns of nanostructured bilayers. Alternatively, simple incubation of aqueous phase rHDL with a chemically patterned hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface produces a novel compositional pattern, caused by an increased affinity for adsorption onto hydrophilic regions relative to the surrounding hydrophobic regions. Further, by simple chemical denaturation of the boundary protein, nanoscale compartmentalization can be selectively erased, thus producing patterns of laterally fluid, lipid bilayers structured solely at the mesoscopic length scale. Since these aqueous phase microarrays of nanostructured lipid bilayers allow for membrane proteins to be embedded within single nanoscale bilayer compartments, they present a viable means of generating high-density membrane protein arrays. Such a system would permit in-depth elucidation of membrane protein structure-function relationships and the consequences of membrane compartmentalization on lipid dynamics.","['Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Lipoproteins', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nanostructures', 'Particle Size', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Surface Properties', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Water']",18642906,"[['D10.570.755.375.760.400.800.200'], ['D10.570.510', 'J01.637.087.500.510'], ['D10.532', 'D12.776.521'], ['E05.599.595'], ['J01.637.512'], ['G02.712'], ['E05.588.570.700', 'E05.601.680'], ['G02.860'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
4809,Implementation of an HACCP model in foot and mouth disease control programmes.,"The organisation and structure of the official Veterinary Services (OVS) are designed to meet a specific aim--the health certification of animal health, welfare and food safety in the production and processing stage. Disease prevention and control calls for programmes and projects that, depending on the characteristics of each disease, may involve any branch of the OVS, from the laboratory to field activities. For the purpose of this work, the model used is that of a country that is 'free from foot and mouth disease with vaccination' in accordance with the conditions stipulated in Chapter 8.8. of the World Organisation for Animal Health Terrestrial Animal Health Code. These conditions state that, to maintain this health status, a programme of monitoring and continuous control of the relevant variables must be implemented. This is achieved by applying good practice and identifying the critical control points in all processes, using a checklist that simplifies the task.

The effect of MRP1 G1666A and GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphisms on blood and urinary arsenic levels were determined in 95 Turkish smelter workers. Blood and urinary arsenic concentrations were measured by GF-AAS with Zeeman correction and gene polymorphisms were investigated by PCR-RFLP method. The mean blood and urinary arsenic levels were 21.60±12.28ìg/L and 5.58±4.37ìg/L, respectively. A significant association between MRP1 1666A allele and urinary arsenic levels was found (p=0.001). GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism was detected not to be associated with either blood or urinary arsenic levels (p=0.384, p=0.440, respectively). Significant association was also detected between MRP1A(-)/GSTP1Val(-) genotypes and urinary arsenic levels (p=0.001). This study suggested that MRP1 G1666A alone and, also, combined with GSTP1 Ile105Val were associated with inter-individual variations in urinary arsenic levels, but not with blood arsenic levels.","['Adult', 'Arsenic', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Humans', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Turkey']",26970057,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D01.268.513.249'], ['D08.811.913.225.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.157.530.100.304', 'D12.776.157.530.450.074.500.500.500', 'D12.776.543.585.100.304', 'D12.776.543.585.450.074.500.500.500'], ['N06.850.460.350.600'], ['G05.365.795'], ['Z01.252.245.500.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
25605,[Positron emission tomography/computed tomography for lung cancer staging].,"BACKGROUND: PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography) is widely used in nodal and metastatic staging of lung cancer patients.AIM: To analyze PET/CT detection of metastatic disease in patients with lung cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively F18Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT scans performed between December 2008 and December 2013. We selected 143 patients aged 30 to 92 years (63% males) with confirmed lung cancer referred for staging, with no previous treatment. We reviewed whole body PET/CT and brain magnetic resonance images. SUVmax (Standardized Uptake Value maximum) of primary pulmonary lesion, hilar/mediastinal nodes, and distant metastases were calculated.RESULTS: Histological types encountered were adenocarcinoma in 55%, squamous-cell in 15%, small-cell in 8%, large-cell in 6% and adeno-squamous in 2%. In 22 cases (15%) histology was not available. Nodal involvement was observed in 60% of patients (44% hilar and 48% mediastinal). Skip metastases (mediastinal involvement without hilum involvement) were encountered in 17% of cases, and were significantly more common among high uptake lung tumors (p < 0.01). Best SUVmax cut-off for node involvement was 4.4 for hilum and 4.0 for mediastinum (sensibility: 86.4%, specificity: 99.8%). Sixty six patients (46.2%) showed distant metastases on PET/CT. The most common metastases were osseous in 22%, adrenal in 16%, hepatic in14%, pulmonary in 14% and cerebral in 12%. PET/CT detected a second unexpected synchronic cancer in eight patients (6%).CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT is accurate for nodal staging using an uptake index as SUVmax. Distant metastases are common, especially in bone, adrenal glands and liver.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Adenosquamous', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",25860265,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.557.435.250', 'C04.557.470.200.150'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['D09.254.229.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.567'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.370.350.350.800.700', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800.399', 'E01.370.350.710.800.399', 'E01.370.350.825.800.399', 'E01.370.384.730.800.399'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['D27.505.259.843', 'D27.505.519.871', 'D27.720.470.410.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
44247,Dynamic gray matter volume changes in pediatric multiple sclerosis: A 3.5 year MRI study.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess, using MRI, the spatial patterns of gray matter (GM) atrophy in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), their dynamic changes over time, and their clinical relevance.METHODS: Sixty-eight pediatric patients with MS (30 with a clinical and MRI follow-up after 3.5 years) and 26 healthy controls (HC) underwent clinical and MRI evaluation. To overcome difficulties in obtaining longitudinal scans in pediatric HC, a group of 317 pediatric HC from an NIH-funded MRI Study of Normal Brain Development was used to estimate GM developmental trajectories. In pediatric patients with MS, deviations from normative GM volume values at the voxel level were assessed at baseline and during the follow-up, using linear mixed-effects models. Correlations between GM volume deviations and disability, IQ, and white matter (WM) lesion volumes (LV) were estimated.RESULTS: Pediatric patients with MS showed failures in GM development in several cortical and subcortical regions, as well as GM atrophy progression in most of these regions, which were only partially related to focal WM LV. Significant correlations were found between regional GM atrophy (particularly of deep GM regions) and disability, whereas higher IQ was associated with reduced deviations from age-expected GM volumes of specific GM regions at baseline and during the follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Impaired GM maturation occurs in pediatric patients with MS, which is only partially driven by WM inflammation, suggesting that early neurodegenerative phenomena contribute to disability. High IQ, a measure of reserve, may offer protection by promoting remodeling of GM pruning in this young age.","['Adolescent', 'Atrophy', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gray Matter', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Young Adult']",30867274,"[['M01.060.057'], ['C23.300.070'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['A08.186.211.168', 'A08.186.854.348'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.711.141.493'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['C10.114.375.500', 'C10.314.350.500', 'C20.111.258.250.500'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Studied were a total of thirty-two dead and slaughtered animals. Bacteriologically, the disease was shown to be caused by types A, D, and C of Clostridium perfringens. Types C and D proved pathogenic for guinea pigs, while type A did not. Isolated was a strain of Clostridium perfringens, which had high toxigenicity. It was found that calves were fairly often affected with the disease. Most severe were the infections caused by type C of Cl. perfringens, with most pronounced morphologic lesions. There were differences in the changes caused by all three types of the organism in calves, which made it possible to distinguish them as causative agents. Type A induced slight icterus and slightly manifested hemosiderosis of the liver, kidneys, and spleen; type D was responsible for severe injury and hyalin dystrophy of the kidneys; and type C caused necrotic enteritis, pronounced hemorrhagic diathesis, degenerative changes in the ganglial cells, and demyelinization of the brain.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases', 'Clostridium Infections', 'Clostridium perfringens', 'Enterotoxins', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Mice']",2876542,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['C22.196'], ['C01.150.252.410.222'], ['B03.300.390.400.200.575', 'B03.353.625.375.500.575', 'B03.510.415.400.200.575'], ['D23.946.330'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18807,Growth rates and life histories in twenty-two small-scale societies.,"This study investigates variation in body growth (cross-sectional height and weight velocity) among a sample of 22 small-scale societies. Considerable variation in growth exists among hunter-gatherers that overlaps heavily with growth trajectories present in groups focusing more on horticulture. Intergroup variation tends to track environmental conditions, with societies under more favorable conditions displaying faster growth and earlier puberty. In addition, faster/earlier development in females is correlated with higher mortality. For example, African ""Pygmies,"" Philippine ""Negritos,"" and the Hiwi of Venezuela are characterized by relatively fast child-juvenile growth for their adult body size (used as a proxy for energetic availability). In these societies, subadult survival is low, and puberty, menarche, and first reproduction are relatively early (given their adult body size), suggesting selective pressure for accelerated development in the face of higher mortality. In sum, the origin and maintenance of different human ontogenies may require explanations invoking both environmental constraints and selective pressures.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Height', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnology', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",16634027,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160.100', 'E05.041.124.160.500', 'G07.100.100.160.100', 'G07.345.249.314.100'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['I01.076.201.450.457'], ['C23.550.393'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

Careful removal of potential ectoparasites and delicate lip or manual placement on leaves followed by intense visual examination characterised this behaviour. It appears to be done to judge whether either ingestion or discarding is most appropriate, the former occurring in most cases. This behaviour may represent a third variant of ectoparasite handling, different from those described at Tai and Gombe, yet sharing features with the latter.

2378,Endoplasmic reticulum stress and glycogen synthase kinase-3â activation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mouse models of accelerated atherosclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling and the contribution of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3â activation in hyperglycemic, hyperhomocysteinemic, and high-fat-fed apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mouse models of accelerated atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS: Female apoE(-/-) mice received multiple low-dose injections of streptozotocin (40 ìg/kg) to induce hyperglycemia, methionine-supplemented drinking water (0.5% wt/vol) to induce hyperhomocysteinemia, or a high-fat (21% milk fat+0.2% cholesterol) diet to induce relative dyslipidemia. A subset of mice from each group was supplemented with sodium valproate (625 mg/kg), a compound with GSK3 inhibitory activity. At 15 and 24 weeks of age, markers of ER stress, lipid accumulation, GSK3â phosphorylation, and GSK3â activity were analyzed in liver and aorta. Atherosclerotic lesions were examined and quantified. Hyperglycemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, and high-fat diet significantly enhanced GSK3â activity and also increased hepatic steatosis and atherosclerotic lesion volume compared with controls. Valproate supplementation blocked GSK3â activation and attenuated the development of atherosclerosis and the accumulation of hepatic lipids in each of the models examined. The mechanism by which GSK3â activity is regulated in these models likely involves alterations in phosphorylation at serine 9 and tyrosine 216.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the existence of a common mechanism of accelerated atherosclerosis involving ER stress signaling through activation of GSK3â. Furthermore, our results suggest that atherosclerosis can be attenuated by modulating GSK3â phosphorylation.","['Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apolipoproteins E', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fatty Liver', 'Female', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperhomocysteinemia', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Liver', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Valproic Acid']",21998135,"[['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114.056'], ['D10.532.091.500', 'D12.776.070.400.500', 'D12.776.521.120.500'], ['C14.907.137.126.307'], ['G07.203.650.240.267'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['G04.434'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['C06.552.241'], ['D05.500.117.875', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.429.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.625', 'D12.644.360.300.500', 'D12.776.476.081.875', 'D12.776.476.300.500'], ['D05.500.117.875.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.429.500.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.625.500', 'D12.644.360.300.500.500', 'D12.776.476.081.875.500', 'D12.776.476.300.500.500'], ['A11.251.860.180.432', 'A11.436.348.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452.394.952'], ['C16.320.565.100.480', 'C18.452.603.378', 'C18.452.648.100.480', 'C18.654.521.500.133.699.418'], ['G03.458'], ['A03.620'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D02.241.081.944.509.900', 'D10.251.400.895.593.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
39233,Do songbirds in wetlands show higher mercury bioaccumulation relative to conspecifics in non-wetland habitats?,"Environmental conditions in wetlands facilitate favorable biogeochemical conditions for the conversion of inorganic mercury into methylmercury. For this reason, wetlands are increasingly classified as mercury hotspots, places where biota exhibit elevated mercury concentrations. While it is clear that wetlands play an important role in methylmercury production, factors such as geographic variation in mercury deposition, wetland type, and trophic dynamics can cause variation in mercury dynamics and bioaccumulation in biota occupying wetlands or connected to wetland trophic systems. Here, we use songbirds as bioindicators in a two-pronged approach aimed at evaluating the state of our understanding of mercury bioaccumulation by songbirds in wetland ecosystems. First, we use a case study in southeast Missouri to compare blood mercury concentrations in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) occupying wetland and non-wetland habitats to test the hypothesis that songbirds in wetlands will have higher mercury bioaccumulation than those in non-wetlands. Adult tree swallows in wetlands had significantly higher blood mercury concentrations than those in non-wetlands; however, no difference between ecosystems was detected in eastern bluebirds. Second, we present a review of the current literature on mercury in songbirds in wetland ecosystems across North America. Mercury concentrations in songbirds varied among wetland types and with geographic location, often in an unpredictable manner. Mercury concentrations in songbird blood varied 3-10 fold at locations separated only by ~10 to several hundred kilometers. This magnitude of difference in blood mercury concentrations among wetlands exceeds documented differences between wetland and non-wetland ecosystems. Therefore, we caution against the automatic assumption that songbirds occupying wetlands will have higher mercury bioaccumulation than conspecifics living in other habitats.","['Animals', 'Ecosystem', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Food Chain', 'Mercury', 'Songbirds', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Wetlands']",31942663,"[['B01.050'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['G16.500.275.157.250', 'N06.230.124.250'], ['D01.268.556.504', 'D01.268.956.437', 'D01.552.544.504'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.620.750'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['G16.500.275.157.812', 'N06.230.124.625']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
2557,Nonisotopic single strand conformation analysis of the 5 alpha-reductase type 2 gene for the diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency.,"5 alpha-Reductase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of defective virilization in karyotypic males due to reduced conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. The gene encoding the affected 5 alpha-reductase type 2 enzyme has recently been cloned, and mutations within the coding region have been discovered as the cause of this disease. We address the possibility of a rapid nonradioactive molecular genetic screening technique for initial diagnosis and report different point mutations in this gene in eight unrelated patients with clinical features of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. For molecular genetic analysis, DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes was studied. The coding region of the 5 alpha-reductase type 2 gene was characterized by exon-specific PCR amplification, nonradioactive single strand conformation analysis, and direct sequencing. In seven patients, homozygous point mutations were identified (Leu55-Gln, delta Met157, Gly196-Ser, Arg227-Gln, Ala228-Thr, and His231-Arg). One individual was a compound heterozygote carrier of two mutations (Ile112-Asn and Gln126-Arg). We conclude that molecular genetic characterization of point mutations in the 5 alpha-reductase type 2 gene may be used as an additional valuable procedure for the diagnosis of this disorder.","['3-Oxo-5-alpha-Steroid 4-Dehydrogenase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Consanguinity', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukocytes', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",8784107,"[['D08.811.682.660.465'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.090.403.180', 'G05.180'], ['D13.444.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['A11.118.637', 'A15.145.229.637', 'A15.382.490'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['G05.365.795.600']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
41482,Quantification of morphologic and hemodynamic severity of coarctation of the aorta by magnetic resonance imaging.,"OBJECTIVE: As the morpholgic severity of coarctation of the aorta is difficult to assess, especially after previous repair, the value of the technique of multiplanar reconstruction of magnetic resonance imaging data to achieve a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the aortic arch was evaluated and compared to hemodynamic measurements.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed 30 examinations in 27 patients aged from 6 to 54 years, with a mean of 21 years, by magnetic resonance imaging using a 1.5Tesla scanner with a standard body coil. Measurements of flow across the coarctation were performed using phase shift velocity mapping, and peak velocity was calculated at the site of stenosis. Aortic cross-sectional area before, at, and beyond the stenosis was reconstructed 3-dimensionally to calculate a percentage degree of stenosis. Morphologic severity of stenosis was correlated to invasively assessed hemodynamic gradients and morphologic data from biplane angiography in 23 patients. Among the 30 examinations, 24 patients had been previously treated by either surgery, in 17 patients, or balloon dilation, while 6 had native coarctation. 3-dimensional reconstruction was possible in all and better delineated the anatomy concerning the hemodynamic relevance of stenoses even as compared with biplane angiography. The correlation between severity of narrowing assessed by diameter measurements in the biplane angiography and 2-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging was r = 0.94, and multiplanar reformation with 2-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging was r = 0.87 with a tendency of higher grading with the 3-dimensional technique (p = 0.0001). The correlation of 2-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging with invasively measured hemodynamic gradients was r = 0.67 versus r = 0.74 for the areas assessed by multiplanar reformation, indicating that the hemodynamic relevance of a morphological approach to evaluate the degree of a stenosis should better be assessed 3-dimensionally.CONCLUSIONS: The 3-dimensional reconstruction of the morphologic severity of coarctation offers additional information over conventional imaging especially in patients with kinking, complex geometry, or collaterals, in whom hemodynamic measurements can become unreliable.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Angiography', 'Aortic Coarctation', 'Child', 'Collateral Circulation', 'Female', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Linear Models', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pressure', 'Severity of Illness Index']",11727906,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.350.700.060', 'E01.370.370.050'], ['C14.240.400.090', 'C14.280.400.090', 'C16.131.240.400.090'], ['M01.060.406'], ['G09.330.100.248'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E01.370.350.400', 'L01.224.308.410'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G01.374.715'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

16021,"Stepwise abnormality of sex steroid hormone receptors, tumor suppressor gene products (p53 and Rb), and cyclin E in uterine endometrioid carcinoma.","BACKGROUND: In the normal cell cycle, the appropriate interaction of factors such as tumor suppressor gene products (retinoblastoma susceptibility [Rb], p53) and cyclins is essential. Abnormalities in the interaction of these factors may result in malignant transformation of the cell. Malignant transformation of the endometrium, which is believed to be a sex steroid-dependent tumor, probably involves a process of uncoupling of these factors and sex steroid hormone receptors. This study is designed to test this hypothesis.METHODS: Fifty-six patients whose pathology slides contained either normal or hyperplastic endometrium adjacent to endometrial carcinoma were selected. Immunohistochemical staining of serial paraffin sections was performed using antibodies to estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), p53, and Rb, as well as cyclin E.RESULTS: The normal and hyperplastic endometria adjacent to carcinoma showed positive staining for ER and PR and negative staining for p53. Of 56 carcinomas, 39 (69.6%) showed homogeneous positive staining for ER and PR and negative staining for p53, whereas the remaining 17 carcinomas (30.4%) contained varied distributions of ER- and PR-negative cells, and p53-positive cells (6 were negative or focally positive for ER/PR and diffusely-positive for p53, 4 were regionally-positive for ER/PR and regionally-positive for p53, and 7 were diffusely positive for ER/PR and focally-positive for p53). The p53-positive cells corresponded to those that stained negatively for ER/PR: This topographic inverse relationship between ER/PR expression and p53 expression also correlated with the staining intensities. Furthermore, the cells with weak or negative staining for p53 had a tendency to stain positively for Rb and weakly positive for cyclin E, whereas the cancer cells with definite positivity for p53 tended to stain either weakly or negatively for Rb and definitely positive for cyclin E. The cells showing diffusely positive for p53 were present significantly in clinical Stage III and pathologic Grade G3.CONCLUSIONS: In the development of endometrial carcinoma, stepwise abnormalities of sex steroid receptors, tumor suppressor gene products, and cyclins apparently exist, and may correlate with the progression of the malignant process.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Endometrioid', 'Cyclins', 'Endometrial Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Menopause', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Receptors, Progesterone', 'Receptors, Steroid', 'Retinoblastoma Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",8625241,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.240', 'C04.588.945.418.948.585.124', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705.331', 'C13.351.937.418.685.331', 'C13.351.937.418.875.200.124', 'C19.391.630.705.331'], ['D12.644.360.262', 'D12.776.167.218', 'D12.776.476.262'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.585', 'C13.351.500.852.762.200', 'C13.351.937.418.875.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.350', 'E05.478.583.400', 'E05.601.470.350'], ['G08.686.157.500', 'G08.686.841.249.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D12.776.826.750.350', 'D12.776.930.778.350'], ['D12.776.826.750.765'], ['D12.776.826.750', 'D12.776.930.778'], ['D12.776.260.704', 'D12.776.624.776.745', 'D12.776.660.807', 'D12.776.744.770'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
39346,Structure and genomic organization of immunoglobulin light chain in the channel catfish. An unusual genomic organizational pattern of segmental genes.,"Channel catfish L chain cDNA was obtained through a PCR strategy and used to isolate multiple L chain clones from cDNA and genomic libraries. Sequence analysis of full-length cDNA indicates that the V region is preceded by a leader peptide, and represented by framework and CDR regions. Both VL and CL domains contain the invariant cysteines and tryptophans as well as other phylogenetically conserved L chain residues. The sequence similarity of the catfish L chain with higher vertebrate kappa- and lambda-chains, however, does not readily allow the catfish L chain to be classified. Eight cDNA clones isolated from a cDNA library were shown to represent different processed derivatives of sterile L chain transcripts. These transcripts share a similar upstream sequence region and extend downstream to include a CL or alternatively a JL segment in partial germ-line configuration that has been spliced into a CL. Sequence comparisons indicate that these transcripts represent the product of different L chain loci. Genomic Southern blot analyses with VL and CL probes indicate that there are at least 30 VL segments and at least 15 CL segments. The analysis of 17 genomic L chain clones showed that each hybridized with VL-, JL-, and CL-specific probes. Characterization of the gene segments in three of these clones indicates a previously undescribed pattern of segmental gene organization. Gene segments are found in clusters with VL, JL, and CL segments in each cluster. Within a cluster VL segments reside upstream of single copies of closely linked JL and CL segments. The proximity of VL segments downstream from JL-CL segments suggests that individual clusters may be closely linked. The VL segments are located in opposite transcriptional polarity relative to the JL and CL gene segments, which indicates that VL segments are likely rearranged to JL-CL segments by inversion rather than deletion events.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Ictaluridae', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vertebrates']",8258698,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.335', 'G12.500.299'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.080.148'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.705.750', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.750', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.750'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200'], ['G02.111.810.550', 'G05.810.550'], ['G16.824'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['B01.050.150.900']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
37045,Ultrasound-assisted activation of zero-valent magnesium for nitrate denitrification: identification of reaction by-products and pathways.,"Zero-valent magnesium (Mg(0)) was activated by ultrasound (US) in an aim to promote its potential use in water treatment without pH control. In this context, nitrate reduction was studied at batch conditions using various doses of magnesium powder and ultrasound power. While neither ultrasound nor zero-valent magnesium alone was effective for reducing nitrate in water, their combination removed up to 90% of 50 mg/L NO3-N within 60 min. The rate of nitrate reduction by US/Mg(0) enhanced with increasing ultrasonic power and magnesium dose. Nitrogen gas (N2) and nitrite (NO2(-)) were detected as the major reduction by-products, while magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)2 and hydroxide ions (OH(-)) were identified as the main oxidation products. The results from SEM-EDS measurements revealed that the surface oxide level decreased significantly when the samples of Mg(0) particles were exposed to ultrasonic treatment. The surface passivation of magnesium particles was successfully minimized by mechanical forces of ultrasound, which in turn paved the way to sustain the catalyst activity toward nitrate reduction.","['Denitrification', 'Magnesium', 'Nitrates', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Ultrasonics']",25781370,"[['G02.111.587.250', 'G02.607.560.250', 'G16.500.768.249'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['D01.248.497.158.606', 'D01.625.525.550', 'D02.583'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['H01.671.031.849']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Horizontal rightward and leftward saccades were recorded binocularly, while subjects looked at LED targets placed at ±5°, 10° and 15° eccentricities. No differences in saccade amplitudes, peak velocities or durations were observed between controls and patients. More specifically, for 5° saccades, patients had a mean peak velocity of 146°/s with duration of 76ms. For 10° and 15° saccades these values were 258°/s, 86ms and 324°/s, 101ms respectively, thereby lying well within one standard deviation of the mean of normal data. Moreover, saccadic amplitude accuracy was also unimpaired. These results indicate that patients with late onset Pompe disease perform fast and accurate horizontal saccades without evidence of muscle paresis or other ocular motor abnormalities. Reported histological abnormalities of extraocular muscles do not appear to have a phenotypic impact.","['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Eye Movement Measurements', 'Female', 'Glycogen Storage Disease Type II', 'Humans', 'Infrared Rays', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oculomotor Muscles', 'Saccades', 'Severity of Illness Index']",25260626,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075.100', 'N06.850.490.250.100'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.380.230', 'E01.370.405.245.787'], ['C10.228.140.163.100.435.340', 'C16.320.565.189.435.340', 'C16.320.565.202.449.500', 'C16.320.565.595.554.340', 'C18.452.132.100.435.340', 'C18.452.648.189.435.340', 'C18.452.648.202.449.500', 'C18.452.648.595.554.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.552', 'G01.590.540.552', 'G01.750.250.650.552', 'G01.750.770.578.552', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.400', 'G16.500.750.775.525.400', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A02.633.567.700'], ['G14.350.500'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40056,The design of a low literacy decision aid about rheumatoid arthritis medications developed in three languages for use during the clinical encounter.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) care is a priority among policy makers, clinicians and patients both nationally and internationally. Demands on patients to have basic knowledge of RA, treatment options, and details of risk and benefit when making medication decisions with clinicians can be overwhelming, especially for those with limited literacy or limited English language proficiency. The objective of this study is to describe the development of a medication choice decision aid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in three languages using low literacy principles.METHODS: Based on the development of a diabetes decision aid, the RA decision aid (RA Choice) was developed through a collaborative process involving patients, clinicians, designers, decision-aid and health literacy experts. A combination of evidence synthesis and direct observation of clinician-patient interactions generated content and guided an iterative process of prototype development.RESULTS: Three iterations of RA Choice were developed and field-tested before completion. The final tool organized data using icons and plain language for 12 RA medications across 5 issues: frequency of administration, time to onset, cost, side effects, and special considerations. The tool successfully created a conversation between clinician and patient, and garnered high acceptability from clinicians.CONCLUSIONS: The process of collaboratively developing an RA decision aid designed to promote shared decision making resulted in a graphically-enhanced, low literacy tool. The use of RA Choice in the clinical encounter has the potential to enhance communication for RA patients, including those with limited health literacy and limited English language proficiency.","['Adult', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Health Literacy', 'Humans']",25649726,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C05.550.114.154', 'C05.799.114', 'C17.300.775.099', 'C20.111.199'], ['F02.463.785.373'], ['E05.245', 'L01.313.500.750.190'], ['I02.233.332.186.500', 'L01.143.450.500', 'N02.421.726.407.229.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0

33687,Nucleoside-amino acid conjugates: An alternative route to the design of ribonuclease A inhibitors.,Nucleoside-amino acid conjugates have been employed to inhibit the ribonucleolytic activity of ribonuclease A (RNase A) and affect the protonation/deprotonation equilibrium of its active site histidine residues. Agarose gel and precipitation assays indicate inhibition of RNase A activity by these molecules with a possible role of the polar side chains of the amino acids in RNase A inhibition. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that the mode of inhibition is competitive in nature with inhibition constants (K(i)) in the micromolar range. The nucleoside-serine conjugate occupies the active site of RNase A and preferential perturbs the pK(a) value of His-119 by its 'free amino group' as found from (1)H NMR studies. Docking studies revealed that the free amino groups of the most active compounds are within hydrogen bonding distance of His-119 in inhibitor-RNase A complexes.,"['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nucleosides', 'Pancreas', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic']",19540766,"[['D12.125'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['G02.282'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.599.595'], ['D09.408.595', 'D13.570'], ['A03.734'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['D08.811.277.352.355.350.715', 'D08.811.277.352.700.350.715']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

13515,Evaluation of serum granulocyte colony stimulating factor levels in infants of preeclamptic mothers.,"In this study we aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) in infants of preeclamptic mothers. The study group consisted of 31 infants of preeclamptic mothers while the control group consisted of 24 gestational age-adjusted infants of normotensive mothers. G-CSF levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mean G-CSF level was 981.8 +/- 1682.5 (25.7-5924) pg/ml in the study group and 770.8 +/- 1779 (18-8526) pg/ml in control group (p > 0.05). There was no correlation between G-CSF levels and absolute or total neutrophil counts on the 1st, 2nd and 7th days in infants of preeclamptic mothers. There were positive correlations between G-CSF levels and ANC on the 1st and 7th days of life in infants of normotensive mothers. Neutropenia developed in 42.3% of the study group and in 21.7% of the control group on the 1st day of life (p > 0.05). On the 2nd day, neutropenia was observed in 61.5% of the study group and 26.1% of the control group (p = 0.013). Serum G-CSF levels were not low in neutropenic babies of preeclamptic mothers. In contrast, higher G-CSF levels in neutropenic infants suggest impaired G-CSF response in infants of preeclamptic mothers.","['Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Very Low Birth Weight', 'Male', 'Neutropenia', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy']",17479645,"[['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['D12.644.276.374.410.240.350', 'D12.776.395.240.200', 'D12.776.467.374.410.240.350', 'D23.529.374.410.240.350'], ['D12.644.276.374.410.240.375', 'D12.776.395.240.300', 'D12.776.467.374.410.240.375', 'D23.529.374.410.240.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.703.520.460.600'], ['C15.378.553.546.184.564'], ['C13.703.395.249'], ['G08.686.784.769']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
38867,Silent versus symptomatic myocardial ischemia during exercise testing: a comparison with coronary angiographic findings.,"Two-hundred-and-eighty individuals with anginal complaints, without prior myocardial infarction and with a positive exercise stress test were divided into a group (n = 67) with exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia and another group (n = 213) with exercise-induced angina pectoris. Both underwent coronary angiography and were compared with each other with respect to various exercise and angiographic parameters. Patients with exercise-induced silent ischemia attained a longer mean exercise duration (P less than 0.001), a higher peak exercise heart rate (P less than 0.0001) and a higher peak exercise rate pressure product (P less than 0.001) than patients with exercise-induced angina pectoris. In the latter group, more patients showed exercise-induced ST-segment depression greater than 2 mm (P less than 0.05). The group of patients with silent ischemia encompassed more individuals with normal coronary arteries (P less than 0.0001). More patients with exercise-induced angina pectoris had three-vessel disease (P less than 0.0001). The exclusion of patients with normal coronary arteries (23% in those with silent ischemia group and 6% in those with exercise-induced angina had no influence on the level of significance for peak heart rate, mean exercise duration and exercise duration greater than 10 min. Thus, in this population, exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia is associated with better exercise performance and less extensive coronary arterial pathology than in exercise-induced angina pectoris.","['Adult', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Disease', 'Electrocardiography', 'Exercise Test', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stress, Physiological']",2335411,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C14.280.647.187', 'C14.907.585.187', 'C23.888.592.612.233.500'], ['E01.370.350.130.625', 'E01.370.350.700.060.200', 'E01.370.370.050.200', 'E01.370.370.380.200'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G07.775']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
30836,[A retrospective analysis of clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of gastric stump cancer].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of gastric stump cancer(GSC).METHODS: The clinical data of 138 patients with GSC treated from January 1992 to July 2008 were reviewed and analyzed. The patients included 122 males and 16 females with a mean age of 61.5 years, and the mean interval between the initial operation and second diagnosis was 21.9 years.RESULTS: The endoscopy and pathological examination showed Borrmann III/IV in 127 (92.7%) patients and undifferentiated carcinoma in 115 (83.3%) patients. The resectability and radical resectability rate were 72.4% and 59.4%. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates was 59.2%, 30.1% and 14.2%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 19.4 months. Univariate Log-rank test indicated that Borrmann type, histological type, tumor diameter, TNM stage, depth of invasion, number of metastatic lymph node, distant metastasis and option of treatment were significant prognostic factors for GSC. While TNM stage, depth of invasion, distant metastasis and option of treatment were prognostic factors on multivariable analysis. The median survival time of patients underwent radical resection was significantly longer (36 months) than that of patients received palliative resection (8 months, P < 0.05) and chemotherapy only (5 months, P < 0.05). Among patients with a tumor of T4 stage, the median survival time was statistically prolonged by combined evisceration (18.6 months) when compared with the patients received palliative surgery.CONCLUSIONS: TNM stage, depth of invasion, distant metastasis and option of treatment are independent prognostic factors for GSC. Early diagnosis and radical resection may play an important role in improving the prognosis of GSC.","['Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastric Stump', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stomach Neoplasms']",21609561,"[['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['A03.556.875.875.578'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C04.588.274.476.767', 'C06.301.371.767', 'C06.405.249.767', 'C06.405.748.789']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40745,Removal of nonionic surfactants from wastewater using a constructed wetland.,"Removal of nonionic surfactants from municipal wastewater using a constructed wetland with a horizontal subsurface flow was studied in 2009 and 2010. Extraction spectrophotometry with 3',3″,5',5″-tetrabromophenolphthalein ethyl ester and KCl served to determine the analyte concentrations. Triton(®)  X-100 was used as a standard to express the nonionic-surfactant concentrations. Anionic and cationic surfactants were shown not to interfere during the determination. Nonionic surfactants were degraded (to products undeterminable by the method) with a high average efficiency that reached 98.1% in 2009 and 99.1% in 2010, respectively. The average concentration of nonionic surfactants at the inflow was 0.978 mg/l, while it was close to the limit of quantification at the outflow (0.014 mg/l). A significant fraction of nonionic surfactants (38.7%) was already degraded during the pretreatment, and only 14.0% of the nonionic surfactants remained in the interstitial H(2) O taken in the vegetation bed at a distance of 1 m from the inflow zone at a 50-cm depth.

A quantitative chromatographic analysis of tear glucose was used and the values correlated to blood glucose values. Diabetic and nondiabetic tear glucose mean values were 0.35 +/- 0.04 mmol/L and 0.16 +/- 0.03 mmol/L, respectively. Significant differences were observed among the subject groups in both the tear and capillary blood glucose values. A correlation between tear glucose and capillary blood glucose was observed. The concentration of glucose in the tear fluid changes proportionately with respect to capillary blood glucose after a carbohydrate challenge. Although it is possible to determine the diabetic status of a subject using tear glucose values alone, in the clinical setting this may not prove to be practical due to technical limitations.","['Blood Glucose', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Glucose', 'Humans', 'Monitoring, Ambulatory', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tears']",17114114,"[['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['C18.452.394.750', 'C19.246'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.520.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['A12.200.882']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
46669,"Multi-exposure and clustering of adverse childhood experiences, socioeconomic differences and psychotropic medication in young adults.","PURPOSE: Stressful childhood experiences have negative long-term health consequences. The present study examines the association between adverse childhood experiences, socioeconomic position, and risk of psychotropic medication in young adulthood.METHODS: This register-based cohort study comprises the birth cohorts between 1985 and 1988 in Sweden. We followed 362 663 individuals for use of psychotropic medication from January 2006 until December 2008. Adverse childhood experiences were severe criminality among parents, parental alcohol or drug abuse, social assistance recipiency, parental separation or single household, child welfare intervention before the age of 12, mentally ill or suicidal parents, familial death, and number of changes in place of residency. Estimates of risk of psychotropic medication were calculated as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Adverse childhood experiences were associated with increased risks of psychotropic medication. The OR for more than three adverse childhood experiences and risk of psychotropic medication was for women 2.4 (95% CI 2.3-2.5) and for men 3.1 (95% CI 2.9-3.2). The risk of psychotropic medication increased with a higher rate of adverse childhood experiences, a relationship similar in all socioeconomic groups.CONCLUSIONS: Accumulation of adverse childhood experiences increases the risk of psychotropic medication in young adults. Parental educational level is of less importance when adjusting for adverse childhood experiences. The higher risk for future mental health problems among children from lower socioeconomic groups, compared to peers from more advantaged backgrounds, seems to be linked to a higher rate of exposure to adverse childhood experiences.","['Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sweden', 'Young Adult']",23341951,"[['M01.060.406'], ['I01.198.240.856.350.250', 'I01.880.735.900.350.250'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['N01.824.196'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['D27.505.954.427.700'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['Z01.542.816.500'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
20700,An effect of trauma on human cardiovascular control: baroreflex suppression.,"Survival from injury depends on the interaction between the patient's own homeostatic responses and treatment given. The function of the principal homeostatic reflex of the cardiovascular system, the arterial baroreflex, was studied in 22 healthy controls and in 21 moderately injured patients (ISS range, 9 to 17; median, 9) using suction stimulation of the carotid sinus baroreceptors. When compared to controls, marked baroreflex suppression was evident 3 hours after injury (p less than 0.05), at 3 days after injury (p less than 0.001), and even 15 days after injury (p less than 0.05, all Wilcoxon rank sum test). Partial recovery of baroreflex function occurred between 3 and 15 days after injury (p less than 0.005, all Wilcoxon signed rank test) and was complete by 5 months after injury. The suppression of baroreflex activity was accompanied by a ""fixed"" rise in heart rate and a rise in systolic blood pressure. This study has shown that moderate injury results in a profound and prolonged suppression of baroreflex function. Further advances in the resuscitation and critical care of the injured may need to take account of such derangements of cardiovascular physiology.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular System', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neck', 'Pressoreceptors', 'Suction', 'Wounds and Injuries']",2388307,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['A07'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.875.500', 'E05.944.600', 'N04.452.859.564.800.500', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.800.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A01.598'], ['A08.675.650.915.750.750', 'A08.800.050.800.900.700', 'A08.800.950.750.750', 'A11.671.650.915.750.750'], ['E04.237.890'], ['C26']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
39734,Thyrotropin-releasing hormone and lysine-bradykinin stimulate arachidonate liberation from rat anterior pituitary cells through different mechanisms.,"TRH and lysine-bradykinin (Lys-bradykinin) increase PRL release and arachidonate liberation from anterior pituitary cells. We investigated whether the arachidonate liberation stimulated by TRH and Lys-bradykinin originates in pituitary lactotropes and whether these events are accomplished through similar mechanisms. Lys-bradykinin and TRH rapidly (0.5 min) increased the intracellular [3H]arachidonate content of rat anterior pituitary cells. Lys-bradykinin also increased [3H]arachidonate liberation and PRL release from lactotrope-enriched pituitary cells, but not from a pituitary cell preparation with a diminished number of lactotropes. In contrast, TRH increased [3H]arachidonate liberation from both lactotrope-enriched and lactotrope-diminished preparations; this increased [3H]arachidonate liberation stimulated by TRH in the lactotrope-diminished cells may originate in the thyrotropes. The effects of TRH and Lys-bradykinin on [3H]arachidonate and [14C]stearate liberation in perfused pituitary cells also were determined. Both secretagogues increased arachidonate and stearate liberation in a biphasic manner, characterized by a transient spike, followed by a lower magnitude wave of fatty acid release. The spike phase produced by Lys-bradykinin was more pronounced than that produced by TRH. The calcium dependence of TRH- and Lys-bradykinin-stimulated arachidonate liberation also was investigated. Cobalt and the low calcium medium containing ionomycin were used to block the secretagogue-induced increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. These conditions blocked TRH-stimulated arachidonate liberation, but only marginally decreased Lys-bradykinin-stimulated arachidonate liberation, indicating that the two peptides act through different mechanisms. Therefore, TRH stimulation of arachidonate liberation is linked to an increase in intracellular calcium. In contrast, Lys-bradykinin increases arachidonate liberation through a calcium-independent intracellular mediator. This calcium-independent increase in arachidonate liberation may involve the bradykinin receptor being coupled directly to a phospholipase, a G-protein that provides a link between the bradykinin receptor and the phospholipases that liberate arachidonate, or bradykinin-induced activation of a protein kinase-C that activates the phospholipases and subsequently liberates arachidonate.","['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Kallidin', 'Kinetics', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior', 'Prolactin', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Stearic Acids', 'Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium']",1505463,"[['B01.050'], ['D10.251.355.255.100', 'D10.251.355.310.166'], ['A11.251'], ['D12.644.276.812.169.400', 'D12.644.456.193.400', 'D12.776.467.812.169.400', 'D23.469.050.375.110.400', 'D23.529.812.169.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A06.300.747.500', 'A06.688.357.750.500', 'A08.186.211.180.497.352.435.500.500', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.352.435.500.500', 'A08.713.357.750.500'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.773', 'D06.472.699.631.525.525', 'D12.644.548.691.525.525'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D10.251.882'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.880', 'D12.644.400.400.740.880', 'D12.644.456.837', 'D12.644.548.365.740.880', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.880', 'D12.776.631.650.810'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D01.268.406.875', 'D01.362.340.875', 'D01.496.749.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
36630,"Ondansetron, an antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors, in the treatment of antineoplastic drug-induced nausea and vomiting in children.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ondansetron, an antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (serotonin 3) (5-HT3) receptors, in controlling nausea and vomiting induced by antineoplastic therapy in children affected by cancer. Six patients affected by nausea and vomiting due to antineoplastic drugs were treated with ondansetron (4 mg/m2). Urinary samples for the assay of serotonin and 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were collected 24 hr before antineoplastic drug treatment, 24 hours after the start of antineoplastic therapy and, 24 hr after the start of ondansetron therapy. All patients were affected by nausea and vomiting within two to four hr after the antineoplastic treatment. Urinary concentrations of serotonin and 5-HIAA were higher and statistically significant (P < 0.01) with respect to basal values. Treatment with ondansetron significantly reduced the number of episodes of nausea and vomiting, as well as the urinary values for serotonin and 5-HIAA.","['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid', 'Nausea', 'Neoplasms', 'Ondansetron', 'Serotonin', 'Serotonin Antagonists', 'Vomiting']",7691978,"[['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.066.288.478', 'D03.633.100.473.404.478'], ['C23.888.821.712'], ['C04'], ['D03.383.129.308.690', 'D03.633.100.473.144.500', 'D03.633.300.148.500'], ['D02.092.211.215.801.852', 'D03.633.100.473.914.814', 'D23.469.050.650'], ['D27.505.519.625.850.850', 'D27.505.696.577.850.850'], ['C23.888.821.937']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
17064,Spectrum of genetic changes in patients with non-syndromic hearing impairment and extremely high carrier frequency of 35delG GJB2 mutation in Belarus.,The genetic nature of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has so far been studied for many ethnic groups in various parts of the world. The single-nucleotide guanine deletion (35delG) of the GJB2 gene coding for connexin 26 was shown to be the main genetic cause of autosomal recessive deafness among Europeans. Here we present the results of the first study of GJB2 and three mitochondrial mutations among two groups of Belarusian inhabitants: native people with normal hearing (757 persons) and 391 young patients with non-syndromic SNHL. We have found an extremely high carrier frequency of 35delG GJB2 mutation in Belarus -5.7%. This point deletion has also been detected in 53% of the patients with SNHL. The 312del14 GJB2 was the second most common mutation in the Belarus patient cohort. Mitochondrial A1555G mt-RNR1 substitution was found in two SNHL patients (0.55%) but none were found in the population cohort. No individuals carried the A7445G mutation of mitochondrial mt-TS1. G7444A as well as T961G substitutions were detected in mitochondrial mt-RNR1 at a rate of about 1% both in the patient and population cohorts. A possible reason for Belarusians having the highest mutation carrier frequency in Europe 35delG is discussed.,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Connexins', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hearing Loss', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Republic of Belarus', 'Young Adult']",22567152,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D12.776.543.585.250'], ['D13.444.308.283.225'], ['G05.380'], ['C09.218.458.341', 'C10.597.751.418.341', 'C23.888.592.763.393.341'], ['C09.218.458.341.887', 'C10.597.751.418.341.887', 'C23.888.592.763.393.341.887'], ['G05.380.383'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['G05.365.590'], ['Z01.542.248.700'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
26532,Anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory effect of a herbal nanoparticle mouthwash: a randomized crossover trial.,"Laboratory evidence has demonstrated the antimicrobial effect of Melaleuca alternifolia (MEL) against oral microorganisms. This randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial, compared the anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory effects of MEL nanoparticles with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) on biofilm-free (BF) and biofilm-covered (BC) surfaces. Before each experimental period, the participants refrained from all oral hygiene practices for 72 hours. The 60 participants were randomly assigned to professional prophylaxis in two quadrants (Q1-Q3 or Q2-Q4), and rinsed with MEL or CHX for four days. The Quigley & Hein plaque index (QHPI), gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) volume, and participants' perceptions were assessed. CHX showed significantly lower mean QHPI on BF (2.65 ± 0.34 vs. 3.34 ± 0.33, p < 0.05) and BC surfaces (2.84 ± 0.37 vs. 3.37 ± 0.33, p < 0.05). Intragroup comparisons indicated reductions in GCF in all the groups, with significant differences only for CHX on BF surfaces (p < 0.05). Intergroup comparisons revealed no significant differences (p > 0.05). Based on individual perceptions, CHX had better taste and biofilm control, but resulted in a greater change in taste. Nevertheless, MEL demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects similar to those of CHX. Further clinical trials testing different protocols, concentrations and follow-up periods are required to establish its clinical application.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Biofilms', 'Chlorhexidine', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dental Plaque', 'Dental Plaque Index', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Gingival Crevicular Fluid', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melaleuca', 'Mouthwashes', 'Nanoparticles', 'Oral Hygiene', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Surface Properties', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Visual Analog Scale', 'Young Adult']",31859706,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.158'], ['A20.593', 'G06.120'], ['D02.078.370.141.100'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['C07.793.208.377'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.300.300', 'E06.208.250', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.300.325', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.300.300', 'N06.890.160.090'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['A12.383.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.773.745'], ['D25.583', 'D27.720.102.583', 'D27.720.269.583', 'J01.637.051.583'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['E02.547.600', 'E06.761.726'], ['C07.465.714'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['G02.860'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['E01.370.928'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
4769,Outcome of the perioperative use of percutaneous cardiopulmonary support for adult cardiac surgery: factors affecting hospital mortality.,"Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support (PCPS) has become a widespread standard modality for the treatment of circulatory collapse; however, its clinical use for postcardiotomy low cardiac output syndrome (LOS) has been reported to be unsatisfactory. We reviewed the clinical outcomes of twenty-three patients undergoing cardiac surgery and treated with PCPS. Solitary coronary artery grafting was undertaken for nine patients, while three had concomitant procedures. The remaining patients underwent valvular surgery. The indications for PCPS were preoperative shock in two patients and postcardiotomy LOS or shock in twenty-one patients. All patients except one underwent an intraaortic balloon pump. Sixteen of the twenty-three patients (69.6%) were weaned from PCPS and twelve patients (52.2%) reached hospital discharge. A univariate analysis revealed that risk factors for hospital mortality were age older than seventy years (P = 0.05), PCPS running time (P = 0.017), low cardiac function at the institution of PCPS (P = 0.004), and urine output within the initial 24 h (P = 0.041). The cardiac index (CI) in survivors was improved within 24 h, and eleven of the twelve survivors were weaned off PCPS within 48 h, whereas ten of the twelve nonsurvivors required PCPS for more than 48 h (P = 0.0006). There is little possibility of weaning patients from PCPS who do not show any signs of hemodynamic recovery within 48 h after its institution. Limited use of PCPS within 48 h may be applicable for postcardiotomy patients, but other cardiopulmonary support, such as a left ventricular assist device, may be required when hemodynamic recovery is not obtained within 48 h.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Assisted Circulation', 'Cardiac Output', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart-Lung Machine', 'Hemodynamics', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Perioperative Care', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Urine']",14961959,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E04.050'], ['E01.370.370.380.150', 'G09.330.380.124'], ['C14.280'], ['E07.858.082.458'], ['G09.330.380'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.400', 'N01.224.935.698.400', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.400', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N04.761.559', 'N05.715.360.575'], ['E02.760.731', 'E04.604', 'N02.421.585.722'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['G01.910.857'], ['A12.207.927']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
2015,Relationship between hyperacute blood pressure and outcome after ischemic stroke: data from the VISTA collaboration.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High blood pressure (BP) is associated independently with poor outcome after acute ischemic stroke, although in most analyses ""baseline"" BP was measured 24 hours or more postictus, and not during the hyperacute period.METHODS: Analyses included 1722 patients in hyperacute trials (recruitment <8 hours) from the Virtual Stroke International Stroke Trial Archive (VISTA) Collaboration. Data on BP at enrollment and after 1, 2, 16, 24, 48, and 72 hours, neurological impairment at 7 days (NIHSS), and functional outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin scale) were assessed using logistic regression models, adjusted for confounding variables; results are for 10-mm Hg change in BP.RESULTS: Mean time to enrollment was 3.7 hours (range 1.0 to 7.9). High systolic BP (SBP) was significantly associated with increased neurological impairment (odds ratio, OR 1.06, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.12), and poor functional outcome; odds ratios for both increased with later BP measurements made at up to 24 hours poststroke. Smaller (versus larger) declines in SBP over the first 24 hours were significantly associated with poor NIHSS scores (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.27) and functional outcome (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.34). A large variability in SBP was also associated with poor functional outcome.CONCLUSIONS: High SBP and large variability in SBP in the hyperacute stages of ischemic stroke are associated with increased neurological impairment and poor functional outcome, as are small falls in SBP over the first 24 hours.","['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Nervous System Diseases', 'Odds Ratio', 'Stroke', 'Treatment Outcome']",19359649,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.411.162'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['C10.228.140.300.150', 'C14.907.253.092'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['C10'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
28273,Estimating costs associated with a community outbreak of meningococcal disease in a colombian Caribbean city.,"Meningococcal disease is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection that is caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis), and it can cause meningitis, meningococcaemia outbreaks and epidemics. The disease is fatal in 9-12% of cases and with a death rate of up to 40% among patients with meningococcaemia. The objective of this study was to estimate the costs of a meningococcal outbreak that occurred in a Caribbean city of Colombia. We contacted experts involved in the outbreak and asked them specific questions about the diagnosis and treatment for meningococcal cases during the outbreak. Estimates of costs of the outbreak were also based on extensive review of medical records available during the outbreak. The costs associated with the outbreak were divided into the cost of the disease response phase and the cost of the disease surveillance phase. The costs associated with the outbreak control and surveillance were expressed in US$ (2011) as cost per 1,000 inhabitants. The average age of patients was 4.6 years (SD 3.5); 50% of the cases died; 50% of the cases were reported to have meningitis (3/6); 33% were diagnosed with meningococcaemia and myocarditis (2/6); 50% of the cases had bacteraemia (3/6); 66% of the cases had a culture specimen positive for Neisseria meningitidis; 5 of the 6 cases had RT-PCR positive for N. meningitidis. All N. meningitidis were serogroup B; 50 doses of ceftriaxone were administered as prophylaxis. Vaccine was not available at the time. The costs associated with control of the outbreak were estimated at US$ 0.8 per 1,000 inhabitants, disease surveillance at US$ 4.1 per 1,000 inhabitants, and healthcare costs at US$ 5.1 per 1,000 inhabitants. The costs associated with meningococcal outbreaks are substantial, and the outbreaks should be prevented. The mass chemoprophylaxis implemented helped control the outbreak.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colombia', 'Cost of Illness', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meningococcal Infections', 'Neisseria meningitidis', 'Sentinel Surveillance']",25395916,"[['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['E02.319.162.150', 'E02.319.703.150'], ['D02.065.589.099.249.190.190.155', 'D02.886.665.074.190.190.155', 'D03.633.100.300.249.190.190.155'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['Z01.107.757.284'], ['N03.219.151.165', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.182', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.046'], ['N06.850.290'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C01.150.252.400.625.549'], ['B03.440.400.425.550.550.641', 'B03.660.075.525.520.500'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700.650', 'E05.318.650', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625.650', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700.650', 'N06.850.520.699', 'N06.850.780.675.650']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
33367,Rapid detection of the Chlamydiaceae and other families in the order Chlamydiales: three PCR tests.,"Few identification methods will rapidly or specifically detect all bacteria in the order Chlamydiales, family Chlamydiaceae. In this study, three PCR tests based on sequence data from over 48 chlamydial strains were developed for identification of these bacteria. Two tests exclusively recognized the Chlamydiaceae: a multiplex test targeting the ompA gene and the rRNA intergenic spacer and a TaqMan test targeting the 23S ribosomal DNA. The multiplex test was able to detect as few as 200 inclusion-forming units (IFU), while the TaqMan test could detect 2 IFU. The amplicons produced in these tests ranged from 132 to 320 bp in length. The third test, targeting the 23S rRNA gene, produced a 600-bp amplicon from strains belonging to several families in the order Chlamydiales. Direct sequence analysis of this amplicon has facilitated the identification of new chlamydial strains. These three tests permit ready identification of chlamydiae for diagnostic and epidemiologic study. The specificity of these tests indicates that they might also be used to identify chlamydiae without culture or isolation.","['Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins', 'Chlamydiaceae', 'Chlamydiaceae Infections', 'Chlamydiales', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Ribosomal', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Bacterial', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 23S', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",9986815,"[['D12.776.097.120', 'D12.776.543.100'], ['B03.440.190.190'], ['C01.150.252.400.210'], ['B03.440.190'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['D13.444.308.475'], ['C01.150.252.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G05.360.340.024.220.400', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.515'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D13.444.735.473'], ['D13.444.735.686.680'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

5529,Lactoperoxidase activity in milk is correlated with somatic cell count in dairy cows.,"Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a milk protein with antimicrobial function. The present study was undertaken to examine the correlation between LPO activity and somatic cell count (SCC) in milk to use LPO activity as an indicator of mastitis. Composite milk of 36 cows and quarter milk of 3 cows were collected once per week from 0 to 300 d postpartum and twice per day for 1 wk, respectively. For the measurement of LPO activity, milk was mixed with tetramethylbenzidine solution and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, followed by the measurement of optical density. When only milk with low SCC (132±12?10(3) cells/mL) was used, a significant decrease in LPO activity was detected in primiparous cows from 0 to 4 mo postpartum. Lactoperoxidase activities of primiparous cows in mo 1, 2, and 3 postpartum were significantly higher than those in multiparous cows. When composite milk was divided based on LPO activity, the SCC was significantly higher in the groups with LPO activity >5 and from 3 to 3.9 U/mL in the second- and fourth-parity cows, respectively, compared with the group with LPO activity <2U/mL. Extremely high SCC were found in the ?fifth-parity cows, even in low-LPO activity groups. In the case of quarter milk, higher LPO activity was associated with increased SCC in all 3 cows. The percentage of quarter milk samples with high SCC (4,062±415?10(3) cells/mL) increased with an increase in the LPO activity. The percentage of quarter milk samples with high SCC was 50.0 to 100% in the milk with LPO activity ?5 U/mL. These results indicate that the correlation of LPO activity to the SCC in bovine milk may point to the potential use of the former as an indicator of SCC.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Lactoperoxidase', 'Milk', 'Parity']",21787923,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['E01.370.225.500.195', 'E05.200.500.195', 'E05.242.195', 'G04.140'], ['D08.811.682.732.550'], ['A12.200.455', 'A12.790', 'G07.203.100.700', 'G07.203.300.350.525', 'J02.200.700', 'J02.500.350.525'], ['G08.686.677', 'G08.686.784.769.472', 'N06.850.490.812.600']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

Eighteen transition pathways, each connecting one random coil configuration with an ideal alpha-helical configuration, were computed and analyzed. The transition pathway energetics and mechanism were analyzed in terms of the progression of the peptide nonbonded contact formation, helicity, end-to-end distance and energetics. It was found that (1) localized turns characterized by i, i + 3 hydrogen bonds form in the early stages of the coil-to-helix transition, (2) the peptide first collapses and then becomes somewhat more extended in the final stage of helix formation, and (3) 310-helix formation does not appear to be a necessary step in the transition from coil to helix.

44049,Elevated BIS and Entropy values after sugammadex or neostigmine: an electroencephalographic or electromyographic phenomenon?,"BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is designed to antagonize neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by rocuronium or vecuronium. In clinical practice, we have noticed a rise in the numerical values of bispectral index (BIS) and Entropy, two electroencephalogram (EEG) - based depth of anesthesia monitors, during the reversal of the NMB with sugammadex. The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was to test this impression and to compare the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on the BIS and Entropy values during the reversal of the NMB.METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing gynecological operations were studied. Patients were anesthetized with target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil, and rocuronium was used to induce NMB. After operation, during light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, NMB was antagonized with sugammadex or neostigmine. During the following 5 min, the numerical values of BIS, BIS electromyographic (BIS EMG) and Entropy were recorded on a laptop computer, as well as the biosignal recorded by the Entropy strip. The Entropy biosignal was studied off-line both in time and frequency domain to see if NMB reversal causes changes in EEG.RESULTS: In some patients, administration of sugammadex or neostigmine caused a significant rise in the numerical values of BIS, BIS EMG and Entropy. This phenomenon was most likely caused by increased electromyographic (EMG) activity. The administration of sugammadex or neostigmine appeared to have only minimal effect on EEG.CONCLUSION: The EMG contamination of EEG causes BIS and Entropy values to rise during reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB in light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.","['Adult', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Entropy', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neostigmine', 'Neuromuscular Blockade', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sugammadex', 'gamma-Cyclodextrins']",22289106,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A07.035', 'A08.186.211.035'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['G01.906.345'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.092.877.674.666', 'D02.675.276.602'], ['E03.706', 'E05.635'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D04.345.103.444.500', 'D09.698.365.855.400.375.444.500'], ['D04.345.103.444', 'D09.301.915.400.375.444', 'D09.698.365.855.400.375.444']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
38677,Dentin-predentin complex and its permeability: physiologic overview.,"The major channels for solute diffusion across dentin are the dentinal tubules. Since dentin permeation is proportional to the product of tubule number and diameter, both of which increase as the tubules converge on the pulp, we find that dentin permeability increases rapidly as the pulp chamber is approached. The presence of a smear layer of cutting debris on top of cut dentin decreases dentin permeability, especially when permeability is measured by fluid filtration. Further, intratubular material--such as mineral deposits, collagen fibrils, proteoglycan linings, bacteria, etc.--can greatly reduce dentin permeability. Although the presence of irregular or irritation dentin has been thought to greatly reduce dentin permeability, recent in vivo experiments in dogs indicate that the dentin permeability of freshly cut cavities prepared in sound dentin falls very rapidly (i.e., 50-60% in the first six hours) before any histologic changes can be detected, either in the pulp or the dentin.

16967,Selective versus non-selective antiarrhythmic approach for prevention of atrial fibrillation after coronary surgery: is there a need for pre-operative risk stratification? A prospective placebo-controlled study using low-dose sotalol.,"AIM: This study evaluated the advantages of 'selective' over 'non-selective' antiarrhythmic prevention of atrial fibrillation after coronary surgery based on a new risk prediction algorithm.METHODS AND RESULTS: In a retrospective analysis of a prospective randomized trial, a model for risk prediction was determined based on clinical data of the control group (A; n = 107) and tested in a test group (B; n = 107, treated with low dose sotalol). Using this algorithm, the effect of a 'selective' antiarrhythmic approach in high-risk patients was compared to a 'non-selective' approach, where all patients were treated. In total, 75 (35%) patients developed atrial fibrillation and 14 (7%) side-effects led to discontinuation of study medication. Based on the risk prediction algorithm, 36% of group A patients were classified as high-risk patients with an incidence of atrial fibrillation of 76% compared to 26% in low-risk patients (P < 0.0001). The selective approach, i.e. treatment of high-risk patients only reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation from 76% to 50% (P = 0.0295) compared to a reduction from 44% to 26% (P = 0.0065) when all patients were treated. More importantly, with the non-selective approach 100% of patients were exposed to the possible side-effects of sotalol and costs compared to 24% only with the selective approach (P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Thus, a selective approach based on a clinical risk prediction algorithm should improve the cost-effectiveness and safety of low-dose sotalol in the prevention of atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sotalol']",9717015,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['D27.505.954.411.097'], ['C14.280.067.198', 'C23.550.073.198'], ['E04.100.376.719.332', 'E04.100.814.868.750', 'E04.928.220.520.220'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['D02.033.100.291.805', 'D02.092.063.291.805']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
368,Effects of nitric oxide on detrusor relaxation.,"PURPOSE: Recently we (1994) reported the photo-induced adequate nitric oxide (PIANO) system, in which an NO- or NO2-carrying molecule which has been photoactivated to release NO, could be exploited to investigate the role of NO in various smooth muscle functions. This study was designed to characterize the effect of nitric oxide (NO) exploiting PIANO on rat detrusor relaxation by isometric tension recording and measuring changes in cGMP content.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exposure to ultraviolet light was used (1 to 60 seconds) to evoke PIANO in the presence of streptozotocin, an NO-carrier, and N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), an NO2-carrier. During relaxation the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content was measured by radioimmunoassay.RESULTS: Rat detrusor strips were reversibly relaxed upon NO generation via PIANO. Pyrogallol, an O2 generator, significantly (p < 0.01) diminished PIANO-mediated relaxation. During PIANO-mediated relaxation, the tissue level of cyclic GMP significantly (p < 0.05) increased over that of the control. Furthermore, methylene blue, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited both the relaxation and the increase of cGMP.CONCLUSION: We concluded that rat detrusor muscle was capable of responding to NO, and these findings might lead to a treatment for bladder instability and detrusor hyperreflexia, by the use of intravesical instillation of NO donors.","['Animals', 'Arginine', 'Cyclic GMP', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Male', 'Methylene Blue', 'Muscle, Smooth', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Nitroarginine', 'Pyrogallol', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Streptozocin', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Urinary Bladder']",8618342,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.125.068.050', 'D12.125.095.104', 'D12.125.142.087'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.454.160', 'D13.695.462.275', 'D13.695.667.454.160', 'D13.695.827.426.160'], ['E05.481'], ['G11.427.494.472'], ['D02.886.369.517', 'D03.633.300.783.517'], ['A02.633.570', 'A10.690.467'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772'], ['D12.125.068.050.587', 'D12.125.095.104.587'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.800'], ['E01.370.384.700', 'E05.478.566.639', 'E05.601.470.639'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D02.065.950.594.768', 'D02.654.692.768', 'D09.408.051.900'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600'], ['A05.810.890']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
22766,"Plasma membrane Pdia3 and VDR interact to elicit rapid responses to 1á,25(OH)(2)D(3).","1á,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1á,25(OH)2D3) regulates osteoblasts through genomic and rapid membrane-mediated responses. Here we examined the interaction of protein disulfide isomerase family A, member 3 (Pdia3) and the traditional vitamin D receptor (VDR) in plasma membrane-associated responses to 1á,25(OH)2D3. We found that Pdia3 co-localized with VDR and the caveolae scaffolding protein, caveolin-1 on the surface of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Immunoprecipitation showed that both Pdia3 and VDR interacted with caveolin-1. Pdia3 further interacted with phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAA), whereas VDR interacted with c-Src. 1á,25(OH)2D3 changed the interactions and transport of the two receptors and rapidly activated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and c-Src. Silencing either receptor or caveolin-1 inhibited both PLA2 and c-Src, indicating that the two receptors function interdependently. These two receptor dependent rapid responses to 1á,25(OH)2D3 regulated gene expression, proliferation and apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells.

6772,High frequency of concomitant mastocytosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia exhibiting the transforming KIT mutation D816V.,"The KIT mutation D816V is associated with autonomous growth of mast cells (MC) and is detectable in most patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM), including cases with associated hematologic non-MC-lineage disease (AHNMD). Recently, KIT D816V was reported to be expressed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, it was not clarified whether these patients have co-existing occult SM. We investigated neoplastic cells in 101 patients with AML for expression of KIT D816V. In 7/101 patients (6.9%), KIT D816V was detectable. After a thorough histologic, molecular, and biochemical analysis, all 7 cases were found to have an associated SM, leading to the final diagnosis SM-AML. Microdissected tryptase+ MC displayed KIT D816V in all patients tested, whereas CD34+ blasts exhibited KIT D816V in only 2/4 patients. In one AML patient, SM without KIT D816V was detected. In all other patients, no associated SM was found, and leukemic blasts were negative for KIT D816V. In summary, our data show that KIT D816V in AML is highly associated with co-existing SM (SM-AML). Moreover, our data show that AML blasts may lack this transforming target-mutant, which may be important when considering the use of KIT D816V-targeting drugs for treatment of patients with KIT D816V-positive AML.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Mast Cells', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tryptases', 'Young Adult']",20471335,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['C04.557.337.539.275'], ['A11.329.427', 'A15.382.652'], ['C04.557.450.565.465.750', 'C20.543.520.350.750'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G05.365.795.595'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.050', 'D12.776.543.750.630.124', 'D12.776.543.750.705.852.150.100', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.200.170', 'D12.776.624.664.700.183'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.902', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.902'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
7421,Combined liver-kidney transplantation versus liver transplant alone based on KDIGO stratification of estimated glomerular filtration rate: data from the United Kingdom Transplant registry - a retrospective cohort study.,"Patient selection for combined liver-kidney transplantation (CLKT) is a current issue on the background of organ shortage. This study aimed to compare outcomes and post-transplant renal function for patients receiving CLKT and liver transplantation alone (LTA) based on native renal function using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) stratification. Using the UK National transplant database (NHSBT) 6035 patients receiving a LTA (N = 5912; 98%) or CLKT (N = 123; 2%) [2001-2013] were analysed, and stratified by KDIGO stages of eGFR at transplant (eGFR group-strata). There was no difference in patient/graft survival between LTA and CLKT in eGFR group-strata (P > 0.05). Of 377 patients undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) at time of transplantation, 305 (81%) and 72 (19%) patients received LTA and CLKT respectively. A significantly greater proportion of CLKT patients had severe end-stage renal disease (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) at 1 year post-transplant compared to LTA (9.5% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). Patient and graft survival benefit for patients on RRT at transplantation was favouring CLKT versus LTA (P = 0.038 and P = 0.018, respectively) but the renal function of the long-term survivors was not superior following CLKT. The data does not support CLKT approach based on eGFR alone, and the advantage of CLKT appear to benefit only those who are on established RRT at the time of transplant.","['Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom']",30793378,"[['E01.370.390.400.300', 'G08.852.357'], ['G12.875.545.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.870.500', 'E04.936.450.485', 'E04.950.774.400'], ['E02.095.147.725.490', 'E04.210.650', 'E04.936.450.490', 'E04.936.580.490'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Thirty-six patients had been pretreated with anthracyclines and 8 were resistant. The combination of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and vinorelbine (25 mg/m2) was administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks, for a total of 6 cycles.RESULTS: A total of 344 cycles of chemotherapy were administered (median 4 cycles per patient). Partial responses were observed in 31 patients (36.0%; 95% CI: 23-56). The median duration of response was 7 months (range 3-11 months) and the median overall survival was 14 months (range 6-21). The scheme was well tolerated.CONCLUSION: The combination of vinorelbine and gemcitabine is an active scheme in pretreated MBC, demonstrating an acceptable toxicity profile, and may well represent a valuable therapeutic choice after anthracycline/taxane regimens.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Deoxycytidine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Vinblastine', 'Vinorelbine']",16739318,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500', 'D13.570.230.329', 'D13.570.685.245.500'], ['E02.319.283'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.132.436.681.827.650', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.827.650', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.827.650'], ['D03.132.436.681.827.915', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.827.915', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.827.915']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
15248,Light-mediated activation reveals a key role for Rac in collective guidance of cell movement in vivo.,"The small GTPase Rac induces actin polymerization, membrane ruffling and focal contact formation in cultured single cells but can either repress or stimulate motility in epithelial cells depending on the conditions. The role of Rac in collective epithelial cell movements in vivo, which are important for both morphogenesis and metastasis, is therefore difficult to predict. Recently, photoactivatable analogues of Rac (PA-Rac) have been developed, allowing rapid and reversible activation or inactivation of Rac using light. In cultured single cells, light-activated Rac leads to focal membrane ruffling, protrusion and migration. Here we show that focal activation of Rac is also sufficient to polarize an entire group of cells in vivo, specifically the border cells of the Drosophila ovary. Moreover, activation or inactivation of Rac in one cell of the cluster caused a dramatic response in the other cells, suggesting that the cells sense direction as a group according to relative levels of Rac activity. Communication between cells of the cluster required Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) but not guidance receptor signalling. These studies further show that photoactivatable proteins are effective tools in vivo.","['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Surface Extensions', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Drosophila', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Proteins']",20473296,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['A11.284.180'], ['A11.251'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.750.310.250'], ['A11.436'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
14996,Stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 heals rectovaginal fistula in rats.,"AIM: Rectovaginal fistula is a devastating condition providing more than 99% of patients for surgical treatment. We hypothesized that rectovaginal fistula may be healed by therapy with stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, in consistence with its initial clinical application and effect on external fistulas.MAIN METHODS: BPC 157 (10ìg/kg or 10ng/kg) was given perorally, in drinking water (0.16ìg/ml or 0.16ng/ml, 12ml/rat/day) till sacrifice, or alternatively, intraperitoneally, first application at 30min after surgery, last at 24h before sacrifice. Controls simultaneously received an equivolume of saline (5.0ml/kg ip) or water only (12ml/rat/day). The assessment (i.e., rectal and vaginal defect, fistula leakage, defecation through the fistula, adhesions and intestinal obstruction as healing processes) was at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21.KEY FINDINGS: Regularly, rectovaginal fistulas exhibited poor healing, with both of the defects persisting, continuous fistula leakage, defecation through the fistula, advanced adhesion formation and intestinal obstruction. By contrast, BPC 157 given perorally or intraperitoneally, in ìg- and ng-regimens rapidly improved the whole presentation, with both rectal and vaginal defects simultaneously ameliorated and eventually healed. The maximal instilled volume was continuously raised till the values of healthy rats were achieved, there were no signs of defecation through the fistula. A counteraction of advanced adhesion formation and intestinal obstruction was achieved. Microscopic improvement was along with macroscopic findings.SIGNIFICANCE: BPC 157 effects appear to be suited to induce a full healing of rectovaginal fistulas in rats.","['Animals', 'Anti-Ulcer Agents', 'Female', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Rectovaginal Fistula', 'Wound Healing']",26872976,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.483.203'], ['D12.644.541'], ['D12.776'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['C06.267.550.600.650', 'C06.405.469.471.600.650', 'C06.405.469.860.752.650', 'C13.351.500.894.767.249', 'C23.300.575.185.550.600.650', 'C23.300.575.925.558'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23752,Induction of cytoplasmic factors that bind to the 3' AU-rich region of human interferon beta mRNA during early development of Xenopus laevis.,"Certain endogenous Xenopus mRNAs, carrying a destabilizing 3' AU-rich sequence, are unusually very stable in oocytes and become unstable only after fertilization. In addition, heterologous short lived mRNA, containing 3' AU-rich sequences, appear to be very stable when injected into Xenopus oocytes. In the present study, a human interferon beta (hu-IFN beta) mRNA, carrying the destabilizing 3' AU-rich element, was used as a probe to identify Xenopus proteins that specifically bind to the 3' AU-rich element as well as to study their relative levels during early embryonic development. While three major proteins that specifically bind to the 3' AU-rich element were detected in human SV80 cells, that naturally express hu-IFN beta (proteins termed AU-F1, F2 and F3), only two proteins, migrating similarly to the SV80 AU-F1 and AU-F3, were detected in cytoplasmic extracts from Xenopus oocytes or eggs. Following fertilization, the intensity of the Xenopus AU-F1 and AU-F3 proteins increased considerably and a new protein, corresponding to SV80 AU-F2, was also detected. Cyclohexamide applied either at the morula or at the early blastula stages reduced the intensity of the AU-binding factors, while actinomycin D did not, indicating that the levels of these factors during these stages are regulated posttranscriptionally. In contrast, application of each of these metabolic inhibitors at the late blastula stage increased the intensity of the AU-binding proteins. The possible function of these AU-binding factors in regulating the expression and half life of AU-rich mRNAs is discussed.","['Adenine', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Blastocyst', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm', 'Egg Proteins', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta', 'Morula', 'Oocytes', 'Ovum', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Uracil', 'Xenopus laevis']",8282101,"[['D03.633.100.759.138'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['A16.254.500'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A11.284.430.214'], ['D12.776.290'], ['A13.350', 'A16.331'], ['G08.686.784.277'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.275', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.275', 'D23.529.374.440.890.275'], ['A16.615'], ['A05.360.490.690.680', 'A11.497.497.600'], ['A05.360.490.690', 'A11.497.497', 'A16.690'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D12.776.157.725', 'D12.776.664.962'], ['D03.383.742.698.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.610.500.562']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
