45536,Determinants of antenatal care utilisation in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the determinants of antenatal care (ANC) utilisation in sub-Saharan Africa.DESIGN: Systematic review.DATA SOURCES: Databases searched were PubMed, OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science.ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Primary studies reporting on determinants of ANC utilisation following multivariate analysis, conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and published in English language between 2008 and 2018.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A data extraction form was used to extract the following information: name of first author, year of publication, study location, study design, study subjects, sample size and determinants. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist for reporting a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol was used to guide the screening and eligibility of the studies. The Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies was used to assess the quality of the studies while the Andersen framework was used to report findings.RESULTS: 74 studies that met the inclusion criteria were fully assessed. Most studies identified socioeconomic status, urban residence, older/increasing age, low parity, being educated and having an educated partner, being employed, being married and Christian religion as predictors of ANC attendance and timeliness. Awareness of danger signs, timing and adequate number of antenatal visits, exposure to mass media and good attitude towards ANC utilisation made attendance and initiation of ANC in first trimester more likely. Having an unplanned pregnancy, previous pregnancy complications, poor autonomy, lack of husband's support, increased distance to health facility, not having health insurance and high cost of services negatively impacted the overall uptake, timing and frequency of antenatal visits.CONCLUSION: A variety of predisposing, enabling and need factors affect ANC utilisation in sub-Saharan Africa. Intersectoral collaboration to promote female education and empowerment, improve geographical access and strengthened implementation of ANC policies with active community participation are recommended.","['Africa South of the Sahara', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Care', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",31594900,"[['Z01.058.290'], ['N04.590.374.350', 'N05.300.430'], ['N03.349.380.420', 'N05.300.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.100.150.750.500', 'F01.145.488.887.500', 'N05.300.150.800.500'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E02.760.786', 'N02.421.143.620.704', 'N02.421.585.786'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
46038,"Effects of HSPA8, an evolutionarily conserved oviductal protein, on boar and bull spermatozoa.","Previous studies have shown that a soluble protein fraction derived from preparations of apical plasma membrane (APM) of the oviductal epithelium enhances the in vitro survival of mammalian spermatozoa. Here, we show that the survival enhancing property of the soluble protein fraction seems to depend significantly upon heat shock 70 kDa protein 8 (HSPA8 previously known as HSPA10). The following findings in the present study enabled us to draw this conclusion: first, using proteomic analysis, we identified a subset of 70 kDa oviductal surface proteins that bound to spermatozoa, one of which was HSPA8. Second, pre-treatment of the soluble protein fraction with anti-HSPA8 antibody reduced the 24 h (at 39 degrees C) sperm survival enhancement effect normally induced by the presence of 200 microg/ml soluble APM proteins. Third, complementary experiments showed that substituting the soluble protein fraction with bovine recombinant HSPA8 (0.5-2 microg/ml) also elicited the sperm survival effect. Finally, we also tested the effect of bovine recombinant HSPA8 on bull spermatozoa and found similar, dose-responsive, sperm survival promoting effects. The conserved nature of HSPA8 between mammalian species suggests that this protein may represent a common biological mechanism for the maintenance of sperm survival in the oviduct.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelium', 'Fallopian Tubes', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Spermatozoa', 'Swine']",18996976,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A11.284.149'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['A10.272'], ['A05.360.319.114.373', 'A13.706.500'], ['E02.875.800.750', 'E05.820.800.750'], ['D12.776.580.216.375.200'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['D12.776.828'], ['A05.360.490.890', 'A11.497.760'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33493,Dlx5 drives Runx2 expression and osteogenic differentiation in developing cranial suture mesenchyme.,"Craniofacial bones derive from cephalic neural crest, by endochondral or intramembranous ossification. Here, we address the role of the homeobox transcription factor Dlx5 during the initial steps of calvaria membranous differentiation and we show that Dlx5 elicits Runx2 induction and full osteoblast differentiation in embryonic suture mesenchyme grown ""in vitro"". First, we compare Dlx5 expression to bone-related gene expression in the developing skull and mandibular bones. We classify genes into three groups related to consecutive steps of ossification. Secondly, we study Dlx5 activity in osteoblast precursors, by transfecting Dlx5 into skull mesenchyme dissected prior to the onset of either Dlx5 and Runx2 expression or osteogenesis. We find that Dlx5 does not modify the proliferation rate or the expression of suture markers in the immature calvaria cells. Rather, Dlx5 initiates a complete osteogenic differentiation in these early primary cells, by triggering Runx2, osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and other gene expression according to the sequential temporal sequence observed during skull osteogenesis ""in vivo"". Thirdly, we show that BMP signaling activates Dlx5, Runx2, and alkaline phosphatase in those primary cultures and that a dominant-negative Dlx factor interferes with the ability of the BMP pathway to activate Runx2 expression. Together, these data suggest a pivotal role of Dlx5 and related Dlx factors in the onset of differentiation of chick calvaria osteoblasts.","['Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Cranial Sutures', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Mesoderm', 'Osteogenesis', 'Osteopontin', 'Transcription Factors']",17335796,"[['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.050.301.264', 'D23.101.100'], ['G04.152'], ['A11.251'], ['A13.350.150', 'A16.331.200'], ['D12.776.930.155.200.100'], ['A02.835.232.781.200'], ['D12.776.260.400'], ['A16.504.660'], ['G07.345.500.325.377.625.050.500.729', 'G11.427.578.050.500.729'], ['D12.644.276.374.625', 'D12.776.395.700.837', 'D12.776.467.374.625', 'D12.776.860.300.762', 'D23.529.374.625'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33031,"Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein gene expression, steroid-hormone secretion and proliferative activity of adrenocortical cells in the presence of proteasome inhibitors: in vivo studies on the regenerating rat adrenal cortex.","Previous studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors promote the accumulation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) in cultured rat adrenocortical cells. Unexpectedly, this response was associated with a moderate lowering in the corticosterone secretion and proliferation rate of cultured cells. Hence, we studied the effects of proteasome inhibitors MG115 and MG132 on the secretion and proliferative activity of the regenerating adrenal cortex in rats 5 days after surgery. Animals were given two subcutaneous injections of 0.15 or 1.5 nmol/100 g of inhibitors 24 and 12 h before decapitation. Real-time PCR and Western blotting showed that StAR expression, both mRNA and protein, was markedly lower in regenerating adrenals than in the intact gland of sham-operated rats. Neither MG115 nor MG132 affected StAR expression in regenerating gland. Inhibitors induced a slight decrease in the plasma concentrations of aldosterone and corticosterone, but did not significantly alter metaphase index of the regenerating adrenal cortex. Our findings provide the first evidence that down-regulation of StAR occurs during the early stages of adrenal regeneration. Moreover, this suggests that the steroidogenic pathway is more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than that regulating proliferative activity of regenerating adrenal cortex in the rat.","['Adrenal Cortex', 'Animals', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leupeptins', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Regeneration', 'Steroids']",18425351,"[['A06.300.071.140'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['G05.308'], ['D12.644.456.580'], ['D12.776.744'], ['D05.500.562.500', 'D08.811.277.656.918', 'D08.811.600.730'], ['D27.505.519.389.745.705'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['G16.762'], ['D04.210.500']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27389,Protein-RNA Dynamics in the Central Junction Control 30S Ribosome Assembly.,"Interactions between ribosomal proteins (rproteins) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) facilitate the formation of functional ribosomes. S15 is a central domain primary binding protein that has been shown to trigger a cascade of conformational changes in 16S rRNA, forming the functional structure of the central domain. Previous biochemical and structural studies in vitro have revealed that S15 binds a three-way junction of helices 20, 21, and 22, including nucleotides 652-654 and 752-754. All junction nucleotides except 653 are highly conserved among the Bacteria. To identify functionally important motifs within the junction, we subjected nucleotides 652-654 and 752-754 to saturation mutagenesis and selected and analyzed functional mutants. Only 64 mutants with greater than 10% ribosome function in vivo were isolated. S15 overexpression complemented mutations in the junction loop in each of the partially active mutants, although mutations that produced inactive ribosomes were not complemented by overexpression of S15. Single-molecule F?rster or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) was used to study the Mg(2+)- and S15-induced conformational dynamics of selected junction mutants. Comparison of the structural dynamics of these mutants with the wild type in the presence and absence of S15 revealed specific sequence and structural motifs in the central junction that are important in ribosome function.","['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Magnesium', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Ribosome Subunits, Small, Bacterial']",27192112,"[['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['E05.196.712.516.600.676.500', 'G01.154.240.280', 'G02.111.255.280'], ['E05.393.281.526'], ['D05'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['G03.493.750'], ['D13.444.735.686.670'], ['D12.776.835'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.811.870.750.700', 'A20.874']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
22351,High- versus low-top shoes for the prevention of ankle sprains in basketball players. A prospective randomized study.,"Using a prospective, randomized experimental design, 622 college intramural basketball players were stratified by a previous history of ankle sprains to wear a new pair of either high-top, high-top with inflatable air chambers, or low-top basketball shoes during all games for a complete season. Subjects were asked to complete a history questionnaire and were given a complete ankle examination. They were allowed to wear these shoes only during basketball competition. Followed over the course of a 2-month intramural season, 15 ankle injuries occurred during 39,302 minutes of player-time: 7 in high-top shoes, 4 in low-top shoes, and 4 in high-top shoes with inflatable air chambers. The injury rates (injuries per player-minute) were 4.80 x 10(-4) in high-top shoes, 4.06 x 10(-4) in low-top shoes, and 2.69 x 10(-4) in high-top shoes with inflatable air chambers. There was no significant difference among these 3 groups, leading to the conclusion that there is no strong relationship between shoe type and ankle sprains.","['Adult', 'Ankle Injuries', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Basketball', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'Research Design', 'Shoes', 'Sprains and Strains']",8368420,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C26.558.100'], ['C26.115'], ['I03.450.642.845.117'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.370.700', 'E05.581.500.805', 'N05.715.360.325.675', 'N06.850.520.445.700'], ['E05.581.500', 'H01.770.644.728'], ['J01.637.215.800'], ['C26.844']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
35627,Molecular cloning and functional analysis of porcine SULT1A1 gene and its variant: a single mutation SULT1A1 causes a significant decrease in sulfation activity.,"The characterization of the SULT1A1 gene and its variants should have an important impact on the efforts to develop genetic markers to select for low skatole in pigs. Raising intact male pigs would have a significant economic impact on the pork industry; however, the presence of skatole (a major cause of boar taint) in meat from male pigs would be highly objectionable to consumers. It has been shown that the phase II metabolism of skatole metabolites by phenol sulfotransferase is related to the clearance of skatole in the liver. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the SULT1A1 gene from pig liver, examine its expression, identify genetic polymorphisms, and study how a genetic variation in this enzyme translates into interindividual variation in skatole levels. We show here that a substitution of A-->G at base 546 of SULT1A1 causes a significant decrease in its sulfation activity and thus may be at least partially responsible for a higher level of skatole in pigs. Our findings provide an important basis toward the goal of making it possible to predict the sulfation status in pigs and the development of genetic markers for low skatole.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Arylsulfotransferase', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Library', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Skatole', 'Sulfates', 'Swine']",15014971,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['J01.040.090'], ['B01.050'], ['D08.811.913.817.400.300'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A11.251.210.172.500', 'A11.329.228.220'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.126.110'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['G05.360.325'], ['A03.620'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['G05.365.795.600'], ['E05.393.751'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['D03.633.100.473.808'], ['D01.248.497.158.845', 'D01.875.800.800.850'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
43097,Identification of a protective CD4+ T-cell epitope in p15gag of Friend murine leukemia virus and role of the MA protein targeting the plasma membrane in immunogenicity.,"Recent studies have demonstrated an essential role of Gag-specific CD4+ T-cell responses for viral control in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. However, little is known about epitope specificities and functional roles of the Gag-specific helper T-cell responses in terms of vaccine-induced protection against a pathogenic retroviral challenge. We have previously demonstrated that immunization with Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) Gag proteins protects mice against the fatal Friend retrovirus (FV) infection. We report here the structure of a protective T helper cell (Th) epitope, (I)VTWEAIAVDPPP, identified in the p15 (MA) region of F-MuLV Gag. In mice immunized with the Th epitope-harboring peptide or a vaccinia virus-expressed native full-length MA protein, FV-induced early splenomegaly regressed rapidly. In these mice, FV-infected cells were eliminated within 4 weeks and the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies was induced rapidly after FV challenge, resulting in strong protection against the virus infection. Interestingly, mice immunized with the whole MA mounted strong CD4+ T-cell responses to the identified Th epitope, whereas mice immunized with mutant MA proteins that were not bound to the plasma membrane failed to mount efficient CD4+ T-cell responses, despite the presence of the Th epitope. These mutant MA proteins also failed to induce strong protection against FV challenge. These data indicate the importance of the properly processible MA molecule for CD4+ T-cell priming and for the resultant induction of an effective immune response against retrovirus infections.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections', 'Tumor Virus Infections', 'Viral Vaccines']",15163726,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200'], ['D23.050.550.402'], ['B04.613.807.375.525.225', 'B04.820.650.375.525.225'], ['D12.776.775.330', 'D12.776.964.775.350', 'D12.776.964.970.600.850.350'], ['C04.557.337.372', 'C04.619.531', 'E05.598.500.496.500'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['C01.925.782.815'], ['C01.925.928'], ['D20.215.894.899']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1923,Loss of TRIM29 Alters Keratin Distribution to Promote Cell Invasion in Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,": TRIM29 (tripartite motif-containing protein 29) is a TRIM family protein that has been implicated in breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. However, its role in stratified squamous epithelial cells and tumors has not been elucidated. Here, we investigate the expression of TRIM29 in cutaneous head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and its functions in the tumorigenesis of such cancers. TRIM29 expression was lower in malignant SCC lesions than in adjacent normal epithelial tissue or benign tumors. Lower expression of TRIM29 was associated with higher SCC invasiveness. Primary tumors of cutaneous SCC showed aberrant hypermethylation of TRIM29. Depletion of TRIM29 increased cancer cell migration and invasion; conversely, overexpression of TRIM29 suppressed these. Comprehensive proteomics and immunoprecipitation analyses identified keratins and keratin-interacting protein FAM83H as TRIM29 interactors. Knockdown of TRIM29 led to ectopic keratin localization of keratinocytes. In primary tumors, lower TRIM29 expression correlated with the altered expression of keratins. Our findings reveal an unexpected role for TRIM29 in regulating the distribution of keratins, as well as in the migration and invasion of SCC. They also suggest that the TRIM29-keratin axis could serve as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in stratified epithelial tumors and may provide a target for SCC therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify TRIM29 as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker in stratified epithelial tissues.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes', 'Keratins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transcription Factors']",30389700,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C04.697.098', 'C23.550.727.098'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G02.111.035.538.161', 'G02.111.218', 'G03.059.538.161', 'G05.206'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G05.308.370'], ['C04.588.443'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.409.500', 'A11.436.397'], ['D05.750.078.593.450', 'D12.776.220.475.450', 'D12.776.860.607'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['C04.697.650', 'C23.550.727.650'], ['E05.624'], ['E01.789'], ['D12.776'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
31560,An epidemiologic study on aging and dysphagia in the acute care hospitalized population: 2000-2007.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe total and yearly demographic trends relative to aging, dysphagia referral rates and oral feeding status in hospitalized patients from 2000 through 2007.METHODS: We evaluated a prospective, consecutive, referred sample of 4,038 hospitalized patients in an urban, tertiary, acute care teaching hospital. Dysphagia referral rates are described according to year, age (decade), sex, admitting diagnostic category, results of dysphagia evaluations and oral feeding status. Diagnosis of dysphagia and feeding status were assessed objectively with fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing.RESULTS: Dysphagia referral rates doubled between 2000 and 2007, with increases of 20% per year and increases in all decades from 2002 through 2007. Over 70% of dysphagia referrals were for older patients of 60 years and above, and over 42% of these were old old patients over 80 years. Referrals for 80 to 89-year-old patients almost doubled and for patients over 90 years more than tripled between 2000 and 2007. Of older patients over 60 years, 62.3% (1,771/2,843) did not exhibit dysphagia, 18.0% (513/2,843) benefited from specific diet modifications to reduce aspiration risk and 19.7% (559/2,843) were made nil-by-mouth due to severe dysphagia and aspiration.CONCLUSIONS: From 2000 to 2007, dysphagia referrals across all ages increased by 20% each year, with more referrals for older (70.4%) than younger patients (29.6%). Referrals almost doubled for 80 to 89-year-old patients and more than tripled for patients over 90 years. This increase will necessitate additional trained dysphagia specialists at least through 2050 and probably longer.","['Acute Disease', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis-Related Groups', 'Eating', 'Endoscopy, Digestive System', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Risk Factors']",19707014,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G07.345.124'], ['G10.261.178'], ['C06.405.117.119', 'C09.775.174'], ['N03.219.521.710.305.200.080'], ['G07.203.650.283', 'G10.261.330'], ['E01.370.372.250', 'E01.370.388.250.250', 'E04.210.240', 'E04.502.250.250'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['N02.278.020.300', 'N02.278.421.639'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['N04.452.758.849'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

Results and study of contrast sensitivity].,"PURPOSE: To examine the results of retreatment with eximer laser photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) on refraction, visual acuity, haze, and contrast sensitivity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy was performed in 18 patients, once for one eye and twice for the other eye due to undercorrection or regression. Outcome was compared between the two eyes.RESULTS: Uncorrected visual acuity was above 20/40 in 94.4% of the retreated eyes. There was no statistical difference between the two eyes for haze and contrast sensitivity.CONCLUSION: Retreatment with laser photorefractive keratectomy is a safe procedure and should be performed when regression or undercorrection occurs after the first laser excimer treatment.","['Adult', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lasers, Excimer', 'Male', 'Myopia', 'Photorefractive Keratectomy', 'Reoperation', 'Visual Acuity']",10794980,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.380.850.950.500', 'F02.463.593.778.435.110', 'F02.463.593.932.281', 'F02.463.593.932.901.500', 'G14.940.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E07.632.490.244', 'E07.710.520.244'], ['C11.744.636'], ['E02.594.480.875', 'E04.014.520.480.875', 'E04.378.500.875', 'E04.540.825.437.500'], ['E04.690'], ['E01.370.380.850.950', 'F02.463.593.932.901', 'G14.940']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
22454,Activation of the kallikrein-kinin system in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).,"Plasma prekallikrein levels, kallikrein activity and antikallikrein levels were investigated in nine premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and six premature infants without. Plasma prekallikrein and kallikrein were determined with a chromogenic substrate measuring amidolytic activity. Antikallikrein was measured with a functional assay. In infants with severe RDS, prekallikrein levels were significantly reduced (median 58% of initial values (p less than 0.01) about 48 hours after onset of symptoms. In infants with moderate RDS prekallikrein level was reduced less, while in babies without RDS there were no significant changes in prekallikrein levels the first 5-7 days of life. Antikallikrein levels did not change significantly in any babies. The results suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system might be involved in RDS. This could explain several features of this syndrome such as hypotension and edema. Furthermore the findings show that homeostatic functions are altered in this disease, and they suggest that other cascade systems as the coagulation, fibrinolytic and complement system may be involved as well. The findings emphasize that trauma might be a significant pathogenetical factor for development of this syndrome and indicate that RDS is not simply a biochemical disease with lack of surfactant as the only pathogenetic factor.","['Blood Gas Analysis', 'Blood Proteins', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kallikreins', 'Kinins', 'Prekallikrein', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn']",6925441,"[['E01.370.225.124.100.100', 'E01.370.386.700.100', 'E05.200.124.100.100'], ['D12.776.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.442', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.442', 'D12.776.124.125.597', 'D23.119.597'], ['D12.644.276.812', 'D12.776.467.812', 'D23.469.050.375', 'D23.529.812'], ['D08.622.658', 'D08.811.277.656.300.760.442.725', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.442.725', 'D12.776.124.125.597.712', 'D12.776.811.243.658', 'D23.119.597.712'], ['C08.381.840.500', 'C08.618.840.500', 'C16.614.521.563']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
27671,Development of nickel-doped lithium formate as potential EPR dosimeter for low dose determination.,"EPR dosimetry employing L-alpha-alanine has been in vogue during the past few years, due to its tissue equivalence and linear dose response. However, L-alpha-alanine dosimetry has been improved during the past years, the sensitivity of this material is still too low for clinical applications. Polycrystalline lithium formate doped with NiCl2 was therefore examined for radiation response in the dose range of clinical interest (<5 Gy) using CW EPR and pulse EPR techniques. At equal and moderate settings of microwave power and modulation amplitude lithium formate doped with 1.6 wt% of NiCl2 was almost four times more sensitive compared to L-alpha-alanine, which is the most common EPR dosimeter standard. It was shown that the nickel-doped lithium formate has an excellent radiation response with a low limit of the measurable dose, and a linear dose response in the range 1-5 Gy. The relaxation and power saturation studies showed that high microwave power can be applied during measurements to improve the sensitivity of this material as an EPR dosimeter. These results show that lithium formate doped with Ni(II) exhibits promising properties required for further development of an EPR dosimeter in the dose range typical for clinical dosimetry.","['Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Formates', 'Free Radicals', 'Microwaves', 'Nickel', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry', 'Spin Labels']",17129756,"[['E05.196.867.519.274'], ['D02.241.081.420'], ['D01.339', 'D02.389'], ['G01.358.500.505.810.500', 'G01.750.250.810.500', 'G01.750.770.721.500'], ['D01.268.556.607', 'D01.268.956.625', 'D01.552.544.607'], ['E05.799.513', 'G01.750.740', 'N06.850.810.250'], ['E05.799'], ['D02.389.678']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
20899,Target organ damage and associated clinical conditions among Nigerians with treated hypertension.,"AIM: Systemic hypertension is the commonest noncommunicable disease in Nigeria. Hypertension is linked with certain target organ damage (TOD) and associated clinical conditions (ACC). This study assessed the extent, pattern and predictors of TOD/ACC in patients with hypertension in Nigeria.METHODS: The study was carried out at the medical outpatient department of a state hospital in Nigeria. Target organ damage was assessed in these patients. Predictors of TOD/ACC were also sought.RESULTS: A total of 203 patients [73 men (36.0%) and 130 women (64.0%)] constituted the study population. One hundred and twenty-two patients (60.1%) had TOD/ACC. The prevalent TOD/ACC were left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (31.0%), chronic kidney disease (18.2%), diabetic nephropathy (18.2%), heart failure (10.8%) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) (8.9%). There was a statistically significant association between systolic blood pressure and TOD/ACC. Patients with over all blood pressure (BP) control (i.e. BP < 140/90 mmHg) had more TOD compared with those that had overall uncontrolled BP (i.e. BP > or = 140/90 mmHg) although the difference was not statistically significant (Chi2= 1.5, p > 0.05). The association between length of treatment and TOD/ACC approached significance ( Chi2= 9.35, p = 0.053).CONCLUSION: The study showed a high prevalence of TOD/ACC in treated hypertensives. A positive association was shown between systolic BP and TOD/ACC. Early detection of hypertension and strict blood pressure control should help in reducing TOD/ACC in the hypertensive population.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Blood Pressure', 'Diabetic Nephropathies', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Prevalence', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Systole']",15915275,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.411.162'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['C12.777.419.192', 'C13.351.968.419.192', 'C19.246.099.875'], ['C14.280'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['C12.777.419', 'C13.351.968.419'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.058.290.190.565'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['C11.768'], ['G09.330.580.880', 'G11.427.494.570.880']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
28040,Neonatal caffeine exposure and seizure susceptibility in adult rats.,"Early developmental exposure to caffeine in rats results in changes in brain excitability that persist to adulthood. The mechanism of these alterations is unknown. To identify potential neurotransmitter systems involved, we exposed neonatal rats to caffeine and determined seizure thresholds for chemoconvulsants active at different CNS receptors in the adult animal. Rats were unhandled (NH) or received by gavage (0.05 ml/10 g) either vehicle (water) or caffeine (15-20 mg/kg/day) for postnatal days 2-6. At age 70-90 days, each rat was infused intravenously (i.v.) with picrotoxin (PIC), bicuculline (BIC) [convulsants acting at the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine (GABA/BDZ) receptor], pentylenetetrazol [PTZ, possibly acting at both GABA/BDZ and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors], caffeine (acting at adenosine receptors), strychnine (STR, acting at glycine receptors), or kainic acid (KA, acting at the NMDA receptor). Seizure thresholds were analyzed as a function of neonatal treatment and sex. Thresholds for caffeine, PTZ, PIC, and KA were increased as a function of neonatal caffeine exposure (p = 0.01, 0.02, 0.02, and 0.005, respectively). The thresholds for BIC and STR were not altered. There were also gender differences in seizure susceptibility. Thresholds for seizures produced by BIC, caffeine, PIC, and STR were higher in females (p = 0.005, 0.005, 0.001, and 0.0001, respectively), but were not different for seizures caused by PTZ. These results suggest that early developmental exposure to caffeine affects later seizure susceptibility. Moreover, some of these effects are gender specific.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bicuculline', 'Brain', 'Caffeine', 'Female', 'Kainic Acid', 'Male', 'Pentylenetetrazole', 'Picrotoxin', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1', 'Seizures', 'Sex Factors', 'Strychnine']",7635092,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['D03.132.098.077', 'D03.633.100.531.085.077'], ['A08.186.211'], ['D03.132.960.175', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824.175'], ['D03.383.773.400'], ['D03.383.066.600'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.367.800', 'D02.540.552'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.700.700', 'D12.776.543.750.720.700.700'], ['C10.597.742', 'C23.888.592.742'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['D03.132.436.681.722', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.722', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.722']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
40587,"Heat stress induces a glycosylation of membrane sterol in myxoamoebae of a true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.","To know the very early events occurring after heat shock, the changes of membrane lipids were examined. Heat stress induced the production of a certain glycolipid in the myxoamoebae of Physarum polycephalum in a few minutes. The purified glycolipid was determined to be a poriferasterol monoglucoside by structural studies that was previously reported to be expressed during the differentiation of Physarum cells from haploid myxoamoebae to diploid plasmodia (Murakami-Murofushi, K., Nakamura, K., Ohta, J., Suzuki, M., Suzuki, A., Murofushi, H., and Yokota, T.

Acta 992, 412-415) was also expressed rapidly after heat shock. Thus, the activation of sterol glucosyltransferase and the production of sterol-glucoside were considered to be important events that were involved in the signal transduction system to induce some succeeding heat-shock responses, such as the synthesis of heat-shock proteins.","['Animals', 'Glucosyltransferases', 'Glycolipids', 'Glycosylation', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Physarum polycephalum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sterols']",8995287,"[['B01.050'], ['D08.811.913.400.450.460'], ['D09.400.410', 'D10.390'], ['G02.111.158.812', 'G02.607.299', 'G03.191.812'], ['C26.522'], ['E05.196.566'], ['D10.570'], ['B01.046.550.550.600.700.550'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D04.210.500.247.808', 'D10.570.938']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25567,Use of body mass index of adults in assessing individual and community nutritional status.,"Adult malnutrition is much more widespread than is commonly recognized. Described in this article is the use of body mass index (BMI = weight in kg/(height in metres)2) as a measure of adult nutritional status, both of individuals and of communities. Concurrent assessment of the nutritional status of children and adults permits conclusions to be drawn about whether there is generalized undernutrition in a community or whether other factors (e.g., childhood infections or feeding practices) are more important in childhood malnutrition. Included is a tabular presentation that permits rapid assessment of both thinness or underweight (BMI values < 16, 17 and 18.5) and overweight (BMI > 25, 30 and 40). Examples of the use of BMI in both clinical and public health practice are also given.","['Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Nutritional Status', 'Obesity', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Thinness']",8846494,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.585', 'N05.715.360.300.560', 'N06.850.505.557', 'N06.850.520.308.585'], ['E05.318.308.980.485', 'N05.715.360.300.800.469', 'N06.850.505.616', 'N06.850.520.308.980.469'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['H02.403.720', 'N01.400.550', 'N06.850'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['C23.888.144.828', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.828', 'G07.100.100.160.120.828']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
2706,Bilirubin mediated oxidative stress involves antioxidant response activation via Nrf2 pathway.,"Unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is responsible for neonatal jaundice and high level of free bilirubin (Bf) can lead to kernicterus. Previous studies suggest that oxidative stress is a critical component of UCB-induced neurotoxicity. The Nrf2 pathway is a powerful sensor for cellular redox state and is activated directly by oxidative stress and/or indirectly by stress response protein kinases. Activated Nrf2 translocates to nucleus, binds to Antioxidant Response Element (ARE), and enhances the up-regulation of cytoprotective genes that mediate cell survival. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Nrf2 pathway in cell response to bilirubin mediated oxidative stress in the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Cells exposed to a toxic concentration of UCB (140 nM Bf) showed an increased intracellular ROS levels and enhanced nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 protein. UCB stimulated transcriptional induction of ARE-GFP reporter gene and induced mRNA expression of multiple antioxidant response genes as: xCT, Gly1, ãGCL-m, ãGCL-c, HO-1, NQO1, FTH, ME1, and ATF3. Nrf2 siRNA decreased UCB induced mRNA expression of HO1 (75%), NQO1 (54%), and FTH (40%). The Nrf2-related HO-1 induction was reduced to 60% in cells pre-treated with antioxidant (NAC) or specific signaling pathway inhibitors for PKC, P38á and MEK1/2 (80, 40 and 25%, respectively). In conclusion, we demonstrated that SH-SY5Y cells undergo an adaptive response against UCB-mediated oxidative stress by activation of multiple antioxidant response, in part through Nrf2 pathway.","['Acetylcysteine', 'Activating Transcription Factor 3', 'Antioxidant Response Elements', 'Antioxidants', 'Apoferritins', 'Bilirubin', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Kinase C', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",24308969,"[['D02.886.030.230.259', 'D12.125.166.230.259'], ['D12.776.260.108.061.875', 'D12.776.930.127.061.875'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675.700.040', 'G05.360.080.689.675.700.040', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680.765.040'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['D12.776.070.345', 'D12.776.157.427.249.290', 'D12.776.556.579.249.290'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.249.184', 'D03.633.400.909.249.184', 'D04.345.783.249.184', 'D23.767.193.184'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.346'], ['D27.505.519.217.500'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.410.500'], ['A11.251.860.180.432', 'A11.436.348.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.565.100', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.200.100', 'D12.644.360.440.100', 'D12.776.476.440.100'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.565.200', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.200.200', 'D12.644.360.440.200', 'D12.776.476.440.200'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.843.937', 'D12.644.360.450.835.800', 'D12.776.476.450.835.937'], ['D08.811.682.608.800.500'], ['D12.776.260.108.737', 'D12.776.930.127.737'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['D01.339.431', 'D01.650.775'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['G05.308.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
709,"Precise diagnosis of infection in burn wound biopsy specimens. Combination of histologic technique, acridine orange staining, and culture.","This study developed a rapid manual histologic technique on burn wound biopsy specimens for an early diagnosis of infection. A total of 86 biopsy specimens were processed using this rapid manual method, acridine orange fluorescent staining for the detection of microorganisms, and a quantitative culture for the identification and counting of bacteria in adjacent homogenized biopsy specimens. Use of these three techniques has shown their complementarity for the evaluation of sepsis in burn wound patients. The histologic study allowed a classification of the depth of bacterial involvement 4 hours after specimen collection, whereas the acridine orange fluorescent staining was useful for quantitative evaluation of infection in the same delay. Thus a rapid therapeutic decision can be made while waiting for the results of quantitative culture and sensitivity tests, which require 24 to 48 hours. We propose routine monitoring of burned patients consisting of these three tests performed simultaneously on each biopsy specimen.","['Acridine Orange', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biopsy', 'Burns', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Time Factors', 'Wound Infection']",2473075,"[['D03.633.300.046.250.150'], ['C01.150.252'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C26.200'], ['E01.370.225.750', 'E05.200.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670', 'E05.200.500.620.670', 'E05.200.750.600.670'], ['G01.910.857'], ['C01.947']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
36708,Dynamic CT in pancreatic lymphoma.,"We retrospectively reviewed the dynamic CT examinations of eight patients with pancreatic lymphoma. Four tumors were rounded masses with well-defined contours, four were more infiltrating lesions. The median cross-sectional diameter of the tumors was 6 cm (range 2.5-12 cm). At dynamic CT, the tumors were hypodense (n = 8) and somewhat heterogeneous (n = 6). Additional features were enlarged lymph nodes, 1-3 cm in diameter (n = 5), dilatation of the biliary tract and pancreatic duct (n = 5), abnormalities in the fat around the celiac trunk and/or the superior mesenteric artery (n = 4), and venous stenosis or occlusion (n = 7). The CT findings of pancreatic lymphoma are more various than has been previously reported. Findings such as small tumor size, well-defined contours, tumor heterogeneity, pancreatic duct dilatation, and venous invasion may be seen.

24719,Simultaneous time-lamination imaging of protein association using a split fluorescent timer protein.,"Studies of temporal behaviors of protein association in living cells are crucially important for elucidating the fundamental roles and the mechanism of interactive coordination for cell activities. We developed a method for investigating the temporal alternation of a particular protein assembly using monomeric fluorescent proteins, fluorescent timers (FTs), of which the fluorescent color changes from blue to red over time. We identified a dissection site of the FTs, which allows complementation of the split FT fragments. The split fragments of each FT variant recovered their fluorescence and maintained inherent rates of the color changes upon the reassembly of the fragments in vitro. We applied this method to visualize the aggregation process of á-synuclein in living cells. The size of the aggregates with the temporal information was analyzed from ratio values of the blue and red fluorescence of the reconstituted FTs, from which the aggregation rates were evaluated. This method using the split FT fragments enables tracing and visualizing temporal alternations of various protein associations by single fluorescence measurements at a given time point.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Imaging', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Time Factors', 'alpha-Synuclein']",25679333,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.532'], ['E05.599.595'], ['E01.370.350.557', 'E05.601.555'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.644.541'], ['G02.111.694'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.600'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D12.776.631.860.500', 'D12.776.637.500']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
21262,Subtype-specific intracellular trafficking of alpha2-adrenergic receptors.,"The three alpha2-adrenergic receptor subtypes (alpha2a, alpha2b, and alpha2c) are highly homologous G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors all couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and have relatively similar pharmacological properties. To further explore functional differences between these receptors, we used immunocytochemical techniques to compare the ability of the three alpha2-receptor subtypes to undergo agonist-mediated internalization. The alpha2a-receptor does not internalize after agonist treatment. In contrast, we observed that the alpha2b-receptor is able to undergo agonist-induced internalization and seems to follow the same endosomal pathway used by the beta2-adrenergic receptor. Attempts to examine internalization of the alpha2c-receptor were complicated by the fact that the majority of the alpha2c receptor resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and cis/media Golgi and there is relatively little cell surface localization. Nevertheless, we were able to detect some internalization of the alpha2c-receptor after prolonged agonist treatment. However, we observed no significant movement of alpha2c-receptor from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane during a 4-hr treatment of cells with cycloheximide, suggesting that these cells are unable to process alpha2c-receptors in the same way they process the alpha2a or alpha2b subtypes.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Techniques', 'Dogs', 'Endocytosis', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2']",9145909,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G03.143'], ['A11.251.210.172.500', 'A11.329.228.220'], ['A11.251.210'], ['E05.481.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G04.417'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.248'], ['A11.329.228'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.300.300.300.200', 'D12.776.543.750.695.150.300.300.725', 'D12.776.543.750.720.330.300.300.200']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
10985,Challenged but not threatened: Managing health in advanced age.,"In this paper we reflect on discussions with people of advanced age in ?otearoa New Zealand, and draw on theoretical frameworks of resilience and place in old age, to explore insights about the ways older people maintain quality of life and health. Twenty community-dwelling people of advanced age (85+) were recruited in 2015-16 from a large multidisciplinary longitudinal study of advanced age. These twenty participated in interviews about health in advanced age, impact of illnesses, interactions with clinicians, access to information, support for managing health, and perceptions of primary care, medications, and other forms of assistance. We use a positioning theory framework drawing on thematic and narrative analysis to understand the dynamic ways people in advanced age position themselves and the ways they age well through speech acts and storylines. People in advanced age saw themselves as challenged, rather than threatened, by adversities, and positioned themselves as able to draw on a lifetime of experience and resourcefulness and collaborations with supporters to deal with challenges. Key strategies include downplaying illness and resisting biomedical discourses of complexity, positioning embodied selves as having agency, and creative adaptation in the face of loss. People in advanced age exhibit resilience, maintaining wellbeing, autonomy and good physical and mental quality of life even while living with challenges such as functional decline and multi-morbidities. These findings have significance for supporters of older people, emphasising the need to move away from a narrow focus on problems to working together WITH people in advanced age to offer a more holistic approach that encourages and enhances adaptation and flexibility, rather than rigid and counterproductive coping patterns.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'New Zealand', 'Qualitative Research', 'Resilience, Psychological']",29941204,"[['F01.058'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['Z01.639.760.747', 'Z01.678.100.747'], ['H01.770.644.241.850'], ['F02.940']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
37326,Multiple pre- and postreceptor defects in pseudohypoparathyroidism (a multicenter study with twenty four patients).,"Three different pathophysiological mechanisms are probably responsible for hereditary pseudohypoparathyroidism: 1) a defect at the prereceptor-level, 2) a defective membrane N-protein accounting for diminished second messenger production, and 3) a defect in the cytosolic response to the hormone. In a cooperative, study 24 patients (mean age, 13 yr; range, 3-23 yr, 8 girls, 16 boys) receiving vitamin D metabolites (5,000-80,000 U/day) were examined and compared to a control group of 36 normal children. Immunoreactive N-terminal PTH (N-PTH), mid-C-regional PTH (mid-C-PTH), intact PTH and bio-PTH, vitamin D metabolites, and serum calcium and phosphate, alkaline phosphatase activity, and the N-protein activity of erythrocyte membranes were measured in each subject. By clinical and biochemical criteria three groups were differentiated. Eight patients had the completely expressed features of Albright's Hereditary Osteodystrophy (AHO+), including brachydactyly and/or sc calcifications, and increased N-PTH, mid-C-PTH, and alkaline phosphatase activity. Bio-PTH, intact PTH, and N-protein were normal. Nine additional patients with complete (AHO+) had elevated levels of bio-PTH, N-PTH, and mid-C PTH, normal hydroxylation of vitamin D, but decreased N-protein activity. Seven patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism had no features of AHO (AHO-), no increase of urinary cAMP excretion after exogenous PTH, normal PTH peptide levels and N-protein activity, but elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D and decreased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations. In conclusion, we identified three subpopulations of PsHP: group a had a dissociation of N-PTH and bio-PTH suggesting a defective N-PTH causing renal resistance, whereas their bones respond to PTH. Group b had defective N-protein causing generalized PTH resistance. Group c was characterized by high 25-hydroxyvitamin D and relatively low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels, thus providing evidence for a defect in the cytosolic interaction of the two different second messengers for PTH, cAMP, and calcium.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Calcium', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Female', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Phosphates', 'Prolactin', 'Pseudohypoparathyroidism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Parathyroid Hormone', 'Vitamin D']",3001127,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300', 'D12.776.157.325'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374', 'D01.248.497.158.730', 'D01.695.625.675.650'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.773', 'D06.472.699.631.525.525', 'D12.644.548.691.525.525'], ['C05.116.198.709', 'C16.320.565.618.815', 'C18.452.104.709', 'C18.452.174.766', 'C18.452.648.618.815'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.650', 'D12.776.543.750.750.600'], ['D04.210.500.812.768']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
14124,Phase II Study of Modified Carboplatin Plus Weekly Nab-Paclitaxel in Elderly Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: North Japan Lung Cancer Study Group Trial 1301.,"LESSONS LEARNED: Weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound-paclitaxel (75 mg/m2) in combination with carboplatin (area under the curve 6 mg/mL/min) in elderly patients with previously untreated, advanced non-small cell lung cancer showed favorable efficacy, was well tolerated, and showed less neuropathic toxicity.This modified regimen offers potential for the treatment of elderly patients.BACKGROUND: The CA031 trial suggested weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound-paclitaxel (nab-PTX) was superior in efficacy to paclitaxel (PTX) once every 3 weeks when combined with carboplatin (CBDCA) for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; a subgroup analysis of elderly patients looked promising. In a multicenter phase II trial, we prospectively evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of modified CBDCA plus weekly nab-PTX for elderly patients with untreated advanced NSCLC.METHODS: Eligible patients received CBDCA (area under the curve [AUC] 6 mg/mL/min) on day 1 and nab-PTX (75 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was an overall response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.RESULTS: Of 32 patients (median age of 78 years), 84% were male, 56% had stage IV NSCLC, and 56% had squamous cell carcinoma. ORR and disease control rates were 50% (95% confidence interval (CI): 33-67) and 94% (95% CI: 85-100), respectively. Median PFS and OS were 6.4 months (95% CI: 4.8-8.0) and 17.5 months (95% CI: 11.9-23.1), respectively. Grade ?3 toxicities were neutropenia (47%), leukopenia (38%), anemia (34%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and anorexia (9%). Febrile neutropenia and treatment-related deaths were not observed.CONCLUSION: Modified CBDCA plus weekly nab-PTX demonstrated significant efficacy and acceptable toxicities in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Albumins', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Carboplatin', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Paclitaxel', 'Treatment Outcome']",28526722,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D12.776.034'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D02.257.125'], ['C04.588.894.797.520.109.220.249', 'C08.381.540.140.500', 'C08.785.520.100.220.500'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['C25.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888.777', 'D02.455.849.291.850.777'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
26508,"The relation among aldosterone, galectin-3, and myocardial fibrosis: a prospective clinical pilot follow-up study.","UNLABELLED: Primary aldosteronism has been associated with myocardial fibrosis, and is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. We previously showed that aldosterone can induce the secretion of galectin-3. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between myocardial fibrosis and plasma galectin-3 level in patients with primary aldosteronism. We prospectively analyzed 11 patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) who received adrenalectomy from December 2006 to October 2008, and 17 patients with essential hypertension as controls. Levels of plasma galectin-3 were determined in both groups, and both groups underwent echocardiography with cyclic variations of integrated backscatter (CVIBS) to characterize tissue initially and 1 year after surgery in the APA group. Diastolic blood pressure, concentration of plasma aldosterone and aldosterone-renin ratio were significantly higher, and serum potassium level and plasma renin activity significantly lower in the APA group compared to the controls. In addition, left ventricular mass index was significantly higher and CVIBS significantly lower in the APA group (7.3±2.0 vs 9.2±1.7 dB, p=0.015). Furthermore, the concentration of plasma galectin-3 was significantly higher in the APA group (2.1±0.9 vs 1.1±0.6 ng/mL, p=0.005) compared to the controls. CVIBS was correlated to plasma galectin-3 level. In the APA group, CVIBS increased significantly (7.3±2.0 to 9.2±2.4 dB, p=0.032) and plasma galectin-3 decreased (2.1±0.9 to 1.2±0.6, p=0.049) 1 year postadrenalectomy. The patients with APA had increased myocardial fibrosis, and this was associated with a higher plasma galectin-3 level. Both increased myocardial fibrosis and plasma galectin-3 level recovered at least partially after adrenalectomy.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 200611031R; Results.","['Adrenalectomy', 'Aldosterone', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Galectin 3', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardium', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies']",27190071,"[['E04.270.115'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.062', 'D06.472.040.585.353.118'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['C23.550.355'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['D12.776.503.307.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
7618,Dynamics of microbial biomass and community composition after short-term water status change in Chinese paddy soils.,"Paddy soil experiences repeated anaerobic and aerobic changes during rice growth, the dramatic dynamics of soil water status accompanied by changes in redox condition and O2 availability. However, the effect of rapid water status change on soil microbial biomass and community composition is not well explored. Here, we present a comprehensive study focusing on the short-term water status change in 13 Chinese paddy soils. In order to gain a reliable way to determine soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in flooded or water-saturated soils, we also evaluated two different procedures (nitrogen bubbled and 100 °C water bath) to remove chloroform in extracts during the fumigation process. Compared to non-flooded paddy soils, the flooded paddy soils tended to have a lower microbial biomass, and this was much clearer using adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis compared to biomass measured by the fumigation method. Fungal biomass, which was indicated by both ergosterol and the PLFA 18:2ù6,9c, also decreased after short-term flooding. Changes in soil microbial community composition (determined by PLFA biomarkers) were observed after short-term flooding, but the extent varied between soils. This study indicates that the dynamics of short-term water status altered the soil microbial biomass (ATP, MBC, and total PLFA) and community composition. Finally, our results suggested that liquid fumigation combined with the nitrogen-bubbled method is the best choice for analyzing MBC concentrations in water-saturated soils.","['Bacteria', 'Biomass', 'China', 'Ergosterol', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fungi', 'Microbial Consortia', 'Oryza', 'Soil', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Water']",29147983,"[['B03'], ['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.537'], ['D10.251'], ['B01.300'], ['G06.591.750', 'G16.500.275.157.049.100.500.750', 'N06.230.124.049.100.500.500'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.616'], ['D20.721', 'G01.311.820', 'G16.500.275.815', 'N06.230.600'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.555', 'N06.850.425.300'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
23894,Kinetic model of ethopropazine interaction with horse serum butyrylcholinesterase and its docking into the active site.,"The action of a potent tricyclic cholinesterase inhibitor ethopropazine on the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine by purified horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) was investigated at 25 and 37 degrees C. The enzyme activities were measured on a stopped-flow apparatus and the analysis of experimental data was done by applying a six-parameter model for substrate hydrolysis. The model, which was introduced to explain the kinetics of Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase [Stojan et al. (1998) FEBS Lett. 440, 85-88], is defined with two dissociation constants and four rate constants and can describe both cooperative phenomena, apparent activation at low substrate concentrations and substrate inhibition by excess of substrate. For the analysis of the data in the presence of ethopropazine at two temperatures, we have enlarged the reaction scheme to allow primarily its competition with the substrate at the peripheral site, but the competition at the acylation site was not excluded. The proposed reaction scheme revealed, upon analysis, competitive effects of ethopropazine at both sites; at 25 degrees C, three enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constants could be evaluated; at 37 degrees C, only two constants could be evaluated. Although the model considers both cooperative phenomena, it appears that decreased enzyme sensitivity at higher temperature, predominantly for the ligands at the peripheral binding site, makes the determination of some expected enzyme substrate and/or inhibitor complexes technically impossible. The same reason might also account for one of the paradoxes in cholinesterases: activities at 25 degrees C at low substrate concentrations are higher than at 37 degrees C. Positioning of ethopropazine in the active-site gorge by molecular dynamics simulations shows that A328, W82, D70, and Y332 amino acid residues stabilize binding of the inhibitor.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Butyrylcholinesterase', 'Cholinergic Antagonists', 'Horses', 'Kinetics', 'Phenothiazines']",11811945,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.170.250'], ['D27.505.519.625.120.200', 'D27.505.696.577.120.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.984.235.472'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D02.886.369', 'D03.633.300.783']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45007,Sources of sampling variation in saliva cortisol in dogs.,"The main advantage of collecting saliva cortisol as opposed to plasma cortisol is that it is non-invasive and therefore it is now widely used in stress measurement studies on farm animals and dogs. Although a plasma cortisol response to handling associated with blood collection generally occurs at 3 min from the commencement of handling, there is no information in the literature on the time course of the response of salivary cortisol concentration to handling. The aims of these experiments were to (1). determine if there is a response to up to 4 min handling that affects cortisol concentration in saliva and (2). determine the main causes of variation in saliva cortisol in dogs over time. In experiment 1, saliva was collected from six Kelpies at 0 min then 2, 3 or 4 min after the commencement of restraint. There was no handling effect found in up to 4 min sampling time. In experiment 2, saliva was collected from six Labrador Retrievers five times in 2 h (14:00-16:00), three days a week for four weeks. Some of the sources of variation in saliva cortisol over time included between dog variation that varied over a period of days and variation between occasions that affected the group of dogs as a whole.","['Animals', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Male', 'Observer Variation', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Saliva', 'Specimen Handling', 'Time Factors']",12893165,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['A12.200.666'], ['E01.370.225.998', 'E05.200.998'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
34845,Role of circulating gastrin in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: A trophic role of gastrin has been convincingly demonstrated in the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach, but is still a matter of debate in the lower gastrointestinal tract.METHODS: In order to examine the role of circulating gastrin in colorectal adenoma and carcinoma fasting serum gastrin concentrations were determined in 351 patients undergoing complete colonoscopy.RESULTS: In comparison to controls (n = 145) more patients with either polyps (n = 125) or colorectal carcinoma (n = 81) have slightly increased serum gastrin concentrations, leading to an increased mean, but no change in median serum gastrin levels. In 3 patients preoperatively increased serum gastrin concentrations were normalized after surgical removal of the polyp and/or tumor, suggesting a local release of gastrin from the polyp/tumor. Gastrin concentrations do not correlate with the histopathological classification or malignant potential of adenomatous polyps.CONCLUSION: In view of these findings a significant role of circulating endogenous gastrin in human colorectal carcinogenesis seems to be unlikely.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adenoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Gastrins', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",10095150,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['C04.557.470.035'], ['C23.300.825.411.235'], ['E01.370.372.250.250.200', 'E01.370.388.250.250.250.160', 'E04.210.240.250.160', 'E04.502.250.250.250.160'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['D06.472.317.413', 'D06.472.699.280', 'D12.644.400.320', 'D12.644.548.280', 'D12.776.631.650.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670.325', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670.325', 'E05.200.500.620.670.325', 'E05.200.750.600.670.325', 'E05.393.661.475'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
151,Comparison of an auto-stereoscopic display and polarized stereoscopic projection for macroscopic pathology.,"We investigated stereoscopic imaging for gross examination in telepathology. A conventional macroscopic station was equipped with two cameras mounted 6.5 cm apart and images were produced of 30 different routine pathology specimens. Still images were displayed on a three-dimensional auto-stereoscopic display with a lenticular plate (which did not require the viewer to wear special glasses) and as a three-dimensional projection that required the viewer to wear glasses with polarized lenses. Nine observers (pathologists, laboratory technicians and engineers) viewed the three-dimensional images first on the auto-stereoscopic display and then with polarized projection. The observers scored the images for spatial reproduction, surface structure, proportions, colour and sharpness (10 indices in total, each rated on a five-point Likert scale of 1-5, with lower scores indicating better quality). Results were compared with those from five observers who had previously viewed the corresponding two-dimensional images on a conventional (two-dimensional) display. The mean scores across each of the 10 indices were 2.9 (two-dimensional display), 2.1 (auto-stereoscopic display) and 1.6 (polarized projection). All observers stated that the polarized projection had superior image quality with regard to resolution, colour and surface structures.

The constitutive expression of the mtlAFD operon in an mtlF mutant was prevented when entire mtlA or only its 3' part (EIIB(Mtl) ) were deleted. Yeast two-hybrid experiments revealed a direct interaction of the EIIB(Mtl)  domain with the two C-terminal domains of MtlR. Complementation of the Ä3'-mtlA ÄmtlF or ÄmtlAFD mutants with mtlA restored constitutive MtlR activity, whereas complementation with only 3'-mtlA had no effect. Moreover, synthesis of EIIB(Mtl)  in strains producing constitutively active MtlR caused MtlR inactivation. Interestingly, EIIB(Mtl)  fused to the trans-membrane protein YwqC restored constitutive MtlR activity in the above mutants. Replacing the phosphorylatable Cys with Asp in MtlA or soluble EIIB(Mtl)  lowered MtlR activation, indicating that MtlR does not interact with phosphorylatyed EIIB(Mtl) . Induction of the B. subtilis mtl operon therefore follows a novel regulation mechanism where the transcription activator needs to be sequestered to the membrane by unphosphorylated EIICB(Mtl)  in order to be functional.","['Bacillus subtilis', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cell Membrane', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Mannitol', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Operon', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Repressor Proteins']",23279188,"[['B03.300.390.400.158.218.725', 'B03.353.500.100.218.725', 'B03.510.100.100.218.725', 'B03.510.415.400.158.218.725', 'B03.510.460.410.158.218.725'], ['D12.776.097'], ['A11.284.149'], ['G05.308.300'], ['D02.033.800.609', 'D09.853.609'], ['D12.776.157.530', 'D12.776.543.585'], ['G05.360.340.024.686', 'G05.360.340.358.207.500'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.776.260.703', 'D12.776.930.780']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
16665,Biopsied lesions of the gingiva in a southern Indian population - a retrospective study.,"PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyse the frequency and distribution of various biopsied lesions of the gingiva among patients attending a dental teaching institution in Karnataka state in India.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collected from 153 gingival biopsies referred to the Department of Oral Pathology, Yenepoya Dental College in Mangalore, Karnataka state, India during a 5-year period from 2004-2008 were utilised for the purpose of this study. Lesions were categorised by their type and analysed for age, sex and location.RESULTS: Non-neoplastic lesions accounted for 51% while neoplastic and potentially malignant lesions accounted for 49% of the lesions. The most common non-neoplastic lesion was pyogenic granuloma (42.3%), the most common benign neoplasm was fibroma (34.5%) and the most common malignant lesion was squamous cell carcinoma (82.6%). Among all the lesions, the most common was squamous cell carcinoma (24.8% of all the lesions).CONCLUSIONS: Unlike in previous studies, squamous cell carcinoma was the most common gingival lesion. The proportion of malignant and potentially malignant lesions was also higher among subjects in the present study than in other populations. Hence, public oral health programmes need to be formulated to better tackle the burden of these diseases.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibroma', 'Gingival Diseases', 'Gingival Neoplasms', 'Granuloma, Pyogenic', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution', 'Young Adult']",23507684,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C04.557.450.565.590.340'], ['C07.465.714.258'], ['C04.588.443.591.402', 'C07.465.530.402', 'C07.465.714.258.409'], ['C23.550.382.937'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A10.615.550.599', 'A14.549.512'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['I01.240.800', 'N01.224.803', 'N06.850.505.400.850'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
27036,[Effect of Conditioning Agent Combined with Flooding Measures on Absorption and Accumulation of Cadmium in Rice].,"In order to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of flooding measures, soil conditioner, silicon mineral fertilizer and sprayed foliar fertilizer, gypsum powder, and their multiple treatments for reducing Cd accumulation in rice grown in Cd-contaminated soil. A plot experiment was conducted in three different Cd-contaminated soils. The results showed that flooding measures, a single application of conditioning agents, and combined application and flooding treatment can reduce soil-available Cd and the Cd content in various organs of rice with 6.58%-30.01% reduction in soil available-Cd and 12.64%-68.68% reduction in Cd content in brown rice, respectively. The Cd reduction decreased in the following order:comprehensive treatment (T6) > basic application of gypsum powder (T5) > base Xiangrunbang state soil conditioner (T3) > mineral silicon fertilizer and spray foliar fertilizer (T4) > flood treatment (T2). In addition, the average value of the reduction effect of the Cd content in brown rice was calculated. The five treatments in the experiment reduced the enrichment of various parts of the rice, which is a main reason for the decrease in Cd content in the brown rice. According to the field plot test, the combined application of the basic conditioning agent, mineral silicon fertilizer, and sprayed foliar fertilizer, and gypsum powder and flooding measures can be used as an effective method for Cd pollution control in Cd-contaminated cultivated rice.","['Cadmium', 'Fertilizers', 'Floods', 'Oryza', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants']",31854896,"[['D01.268.556.137', 'D01.268.956.061', 'D01.552.544.137'], ['D27.720.031.400'], ['G16.500.175.812', 'N06.230.100.230.250'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.616'], ['D20.721', 'G01.311.820', 'G16.500.275.815', 'N06.230.600'], ['D27.888.284.756']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
23295,Detection of retinoid receptors in non-neoplastic canine lymph nodes and in lymphoma.,"This study evaluated the difference in retinoid receptor expression between non-neoplastic lymph nodes and nodal lymphoma in dogs. Retinoid receptor expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 32 canine lymph nodes. The lymph nodes had been previously diagnosed as non-neoplastic (6 normal and 7 hyperplastic lymph nodes) and B- and T-cell lymphoma (19 cases). Immunohistochemistry for retinoic acid receptors and retinoid-X receptors (and their subtypes á, â, and ã) was performed in all cases. In addition, immunohistochemistry for CD3 and CD79a was performed in all lymphoma cases. Non-neoplastic lymphocytes were negative for all retinoid receptors. Retinoic acid receptor-ã was detected in 100% of B-cell lymphoma and 78% of T-cell lymphoma, while retinoid X receptor-ã was positive in 78% of T-cell lymphoma cases. When normal lymph node architecture was still present, a contrast between retinoid-negative benign cells and retinoid-positive malignant cells was clear. Retinoid receptors were expressed in neoplastic, but not in benign lymphocytes, suggesting their value for both diagnosis and treatment of canine lymphoma.","['Animals', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Lymph Nodes', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Retinoid X Receptors']",24381339,"[['B01.050'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G05.308.370'], ['A10.549.400', 'A15.382.520.604.412'], ['C04.557.386.480.150', 'C15.604.515.569.480.150', 'C20.683.515.761.480.150'], ['C04.557.386.480.750', 'C15.604.515.569.480.750', 'C20.683.515.761.480.750'], ['D12.776.826.701.500', 'D12.776.930.775.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
43604,High-Affinity Binding of Monomeric but Not Oligomeric Amyloid-â to Ganglioside GM1 Containing Nanodiscs.,"The interaction of the amyloid-â protein (Aâ) with neuronal cell membranes plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease. Aâ undergoes structural changes upon binding to ganglioside GM1 containing membranes leading to altered molecular characteristics of the protein. The physiological role of the Aâ interaction with the ganglioside GM1 is still unclear. In order to further elucidate the molecular requirements of Aâ membrane binding, we tested different nanodiscs varying in their lipid composition, regarding the charge of the headgroups as well as ganglioside GM1 concentration. Nanodiscs are excellent model membrane systems for studying protein membrane interactions, and we show here their suitability to investigate the membrane interaction of Aâ. In particular, we set out to investigate whether the binding activity of GM1 to Aâ is specific for the assembly state of Aâ and compared the binding affinities of monomeric with oligomeric Aâ. Using fluorescence titration experiments, we demonstrate high-affinity binding of Aâ(1-40) to GM1 containing nanodiscs, with dissociation constants, KD, in the range from 25 to 41 nM, in a GM1 concentration-dependent manner. Biolayer interferometry experiments confirmed the high-affinity binding of monomeric Aâ(1-40) (KD of 24 nM to 49 nM) as well as of Aâ(1-42) (KD of 30 nM) to GM1 containing nanodiscs, and no binding to phospholipid containing nanodiscs. Interestingly, and in contrast to monomeric Aâ, neither oligomeric Aâ(1-40) nor oligomeric Aâ(1-42) binds to GM1 nanodiscs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a loss of function for monomeric Aâ upon aggregation.","['Alzheimer Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Membrane', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'G(M1) Ganglioside', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Nanostructures', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Phospholipids', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization']",27933798,"[['C10.228.140.380.100', 'C10.574.945.249', 'F03.615.400.100'], ['D12.644.024', 'D12.776.049.407.249.500', 'D12.776.543.039.500'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['A11.284.149'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['D09.400.410.420.025.475.390', 'D10.390.470.025.475.390', 'D10.570.877.360.025.475.390'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D10.570.510', 'J01.637.087.500.510'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['J01.637.512'], ['D12.644.541'], ['D10.570.755'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.694']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
31577,Airway mucus in recurrent airway obstruction--short-term response to environmental challenge.,"Mucus accumulation and neutrophilic inflammation in the airways are hallmarks of heaves. Endoscopically visible mucus accumulations, however, have not been studied during exposure to dusty hay and allergens (ie, environmental challenge). We hypothesized that (1) heaves-affected horses have increased mucus accumulation compared with controls, (2) mucus accumulations increase in heaves-affected horses during environmental challenge, and (3) environmental challenge also induces neutrophilic inflammation and mucus accumulation in control horses. Mucus accumulation was graded endoscopically (mucus grades [MGs] 1-5), and airway inflammation was evaluated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology before (0 hours) and during (6, 24, 48 hours) environmental challenge. Large amounts of mucus (MG 4-5) were specific for heaves-affected horses in this study. Variation among controls was considerable, however, and intermediate grades (MG 2-3) were nonspecific, showing complete overlap between the 2 groups. Median mucus accumulations (25th, 75th percentiles) increased in heaves-affected horses from MG 2.5 (1.5, 3.5) at baseline to MG 3.5 (2.0, 4.0), 4.0 (3.0, 4.0), and 4.0 (4.0, 4.0) at 6, 24, and 48 hours, respectively. MG values did not increase in controls--overall MG 1.0 (1.0, 2.0)--even though controls also showed a moderate increase of BALF neutrophils. Mucus accumulations before and especially after exposure to dust and allergens are increased in heaves-affected horses compared with controls. Healthy controls show considerable variability in mucus accumulation but, despite an influx of neutrophils into the airways, no increase of mucus accumulation after exposure to hay dust.","['Airway Obstruction', 'Allergens', 'Animals', 'Bronchi', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Horse Diseases', 'Horses', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Male', 'Mucus', 'Recurrence', 'Respiratory Hypersensitivity']",14765737,"[['C08.618.846.185'], ['D23.050.063'], ['B01.050'], ['A04.411.125'], ['E05.927.100.500'], ['E01.370.386.105', 'E01.370.388.250.100', 'E04.502.250.100', 'E04.928.600.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C22.488'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.984.235.472'], ['N06.850.460.350.112'], ['A12.200.503'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['C08.674', 'C20.543.480.680']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
512,Screening of malignant hyperthermia susceptible families by creatine phosphokinase measurement and other clinical investigations.,"We investigated 56 families afflicted with malignant hyperpyrexia. One hundred and twenty-four individuals within these families had had an episode of malignant hyperthermia, of whom we saw seventy-two. Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was statistically higher in affected individuals and in close relatives than in normal volunteers. The magnitude of the serum CPK elevations varied significantly between families. While in some families the serum CPK was clearly elevated in affected individuals, in other families the serum CPK was normal or only moderately or inconsistently raised. In these latter families serum CPK measurement was therfore of little or no value in identifying afflicted members. The incidence of musculoskeletal abnormalities was greater in affected individuals and in close relatives than in the general population. Thus, the concomitant individual belonging to a family known to be susceptible to malignant hyperthermia was a better indicator of the MH trait than was the presence of only one of these parameters. For reasons which we do not fully understand, MHS individuals were found to require fewer anaesthetics than normal persons. The incidence of MH crises within each family fell significantly following investigation, counselling, and issuance of Medic-Alert bracelets.","['Creatine Kinase', 'Humans', 'Malignant Hyperthermia', 'Pedigree']",938964,"[['D08.811.913.696.640.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.505.700', 'C23.550.767.600'], ['E05.393.673']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This study reports on the in vitro anticancer properties of BITC against a variety of human and murine tumor cell lines by four independent methods; SRB, MTT, cell counting, and clonogenic assays. Regardless of the assay used, BITC showed promising cytotoxicity in the low micromolar range (0.86 to 9.4 microM) against four human ovarian carcinoma cell lines (SKOV-3, 41-M, CHl, CHlcisR), a human lung tumor (H-69), a murine leukemia (L-1210), and a murine plasmacytoma (PC6/sens). The L1210 cells were most sensitive. BITC administered to mice bearing the ADJ/PC6 plasmacytoma subcutaneous tumor showed toxic effects at a dose of 200 mg/kg (within 24 h of drug administration) but no reduction in tumor mass. However, the growth inhibitory properties of BITC against a range of tumor cell types warrant further in vivo anti-tumor evaluation as well as its biotechnological production.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Plasmacytoma', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",7617765,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['A11.251.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.500.375', 'D02.886.250'], ['C04.557.337.372.594', 'C04.619.531.594'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['C04.588.322.455', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705', 'C13.351.937.418.685', 'C19.344.410', 'C19.391.630.705'], ['B01.650.560'], ['C04.557.595.600', 'C20.683.515.880'], ['A11.251.860'], ['E01.370.225.500.383.910', 'E01.370.225.500.388.930', 'E05.200.500.383.910', 'E05.200.500.388.930', 'E05.242.383.910', 'E05.242.417.500', 'E05.337.550.200.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7824,Effects of acute rejection and antirejection therapy on arteries and veins from canine single lung allografts.,"Experiments were designed to compare the function of the endothelium and smooth muscle in intralobar pulmonary arteries and veins of transplanted lungs during acute rejection and after treatment of rejection. Single lung allografts were performed in dogs. Dogs were monitored for 5 days to allow good recovery from the operation and resolution of early chest radiographic changes. In group I, immunosuppression (cyclosporine A, azathioprine, and methylprednisone) was withdrawn to allow rejection, which typically occurred after 3 days. In group II, immunosuppression was reinstituted at this time during acute rejection until the chest roentgenograms again cleared (approximately after 6 days). The blood vessels were studied at this time. Rings were cut from intralobar pulmonary arteries and veins of the allotransplanted lungs and suspended for the measurement of isometric force in organ chambers. Contractions of arteries and veins to phenylephrine but not endothelin-1 were significantly reduced during acute rejection. In arteries and veins, endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin but not the calcium ionophore A23187 were reduced with rejection. Relaxations of the smooth muscle to histamine increased with rejection in both blood vessels. Relaxations to nitric oxide were reduced with rejection in veins but not arteries. Treatment of rejection reversed all responses toward those observed in arteries and veins in lungs from dogs not undergoing transplantation. These results suggest that responses of the endothelium and smooth muscle of pulmonary arteries and veins of transplanted lungs are altered similarly during rejection. Further, treatment of rejection restores function of the pulmonary blood vessels of lung allografts toward that observed in unoperated lungs.","['Animals', 'Azathioprine', 'Cyclosporine', 'Dogs', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular', 'Pulmonary Artery', 'Pulmonary Veins', 'Reference Values', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vasoconstriction', 'Vasodilation']",8642824,"[['B01.050'], ['D02.886.759.111', 'D03.633.100.759.570.090', 'D13.570.900.111'], ['D04.345.566.235.300', 'D12.644.641.235.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['E02.319.310'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['G12.875.545.328'], ['D27.505.696.477.656'], ['E04.928.600.495', 'E04.936.450.495'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.769.795.539'], ['A02.633.570.491', 'A07.015.733.500', 'A10.690.467.491'], ['A07.015.114.715'], ['A07.015.908.713'], ['E05.978.810'], ['E04.936.864'], ['G09.330.380.925'], ['G09.330.380.928']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
47085,A paradise for parasites? Seven new haemogregarine species infecting lizards from the Canary Islands.,"Oceanic islands are hotspots of biodiversity due to their high levels of endemism, with the Canary Islands being a notable example. A previous molecular study on the biogeography and host associations of haemogregarines (Apicomplexa: Adeleorina) infecting lizards from this archipelago detected seven parasite haplogroups. These haplogroups exhibited high host-specificity and geographical structure, suggesting that they might correspond to distinct biological identities. In this study, along with sequencing a longer fragment of the 18S rRNA, we further explore the distinctiveness of these parasites by analysing their morphology, effects on host erythrocytes and parasitaemia levels. These lines of evidence together with their genetics, host associations, frequency of occurrence and geographical distribution support them as different biological entities. As such, we describe seven new species: Karyolysus canariensis sp. nov., Karyolysus galloti sp. nov., Karyolysus stehlini sp. nov., Karyolysus gomerensis sp. nov., Karyolysus atlanticus sp. nov., Karyolysus tinerfensis sp. nov. and Karyolysus makariogeckonis sp. nov. These new taxa are further examples of endemic diversity in the Canarian archipelago. They also contribute to clarify the taxonomy within the Apicomplexa, a phylum estimated to have one of the lowest percentages of described species.","['Animals', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Coccidiosis', 'DNA, Protozoan', 'DNA, Ribosomal', 'Eucoccidiida', 'Haplotypes', 'Host Specificity', 'Lizards', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Spain']",30871644,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['C01.610.752.250'], ['D13.444.308.442'], ['D13.444.308.475'], ['B01.043.075.189.275'], ['G05.380.360'], ['G06.462.380', 'G16.527.200.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.833.393'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['D13.444.735.686.675'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['Z01.542.846']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
43722,Antiphospholipid syndrome in Mexican children.,"BACKGROUND: Data on pediatric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are very sparse.OBJECTIVES: To describe the main clinical characteristics, laboratory data and complications of pediatric APS patients, and to analyze the differences between primary APS and APS associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory data of 32 children at the Federico Gomez children's hospital in Mexico. Nineteen patients had SLE, 12 (37.5%) had primary APS and 1 (3%) had immune thrombocytopenic purpura. We collected information on sociodemographic variables, vaccinations, age at onset, and family history of rheumatic disease, hematological disorders, skin disorders and non-thrombotic neurological disorders. Immunological features included immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies, IgG and IgM anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anti-dsDNA and antinuclear antibodies.RESULTS: The patients included 24 females and 8 males. The most common thrombotic events were small vessel thrombosis (44%), venous thrombosis (28%) mainly deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in lower extremities, and arterial thrombosis (25%). The most common clinical non-thrombotic manifestations were hematological (53%) and neurological disorders (22%). There were no significant differences between groups with regard to the site of thrombosis, nonthrombotic clinical manifestations or laboratory features.CONCLUSIONS: There were some important differences between the clinical manifestations of APS in children compared with adults, but we found no significant differences between patients with primary and APS associated with SLE. Larger studies in Latin American APS children are necessary to determine whether there are differences between ethnic groups.","['Age of Onset', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies']",22799058,"[['N05.715.350.075.100', 'N06.850.490.250.100'], ['C20.111.197'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['M01.060.406'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.107.567.589'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
23547,STRIDER (Sildenafil TheRapy in dismal prognosis early onset fetal growth restriction): an international consortium of randomised placebo-controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: Severe, early-onset fetal growth restriction due to placental insufficiency is associated with a high risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity with long-lasting sequelae. Placental insufficiency is the result of abnormal formation and function of the placenta with inadequate remodelling of the maternal spiral arteries. There is currently no effective therapy available. Some evidence suggests sildenafil citrate may improve uteroplacental blood flow, fetal growth, and meaningful infant outcomes. The objective of the Sildenafil TheRapy In Dismal prognosis Early onset fetal growth Restriction (STRIDER) collaboration is to evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil versus placebo in achieving healthy perinatal survival through the conduct of randomised clinical trials and systematic review including individual patient data meta-analysis.METHODS: Five national/bi-national multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trials have been launched. Women with a singleton pregnancy between 18 and 30 weeks with severe fetal growth restriction of likely placental origin, and where the likelihood of perinatal death/severe morbidity is estimated to be significant are included. Participants will receive either sildenafil 25 mg or matching placebo tablets orally three times daily from recruitment to 32 weeks gestation.DISCUSSION: The STRIDER trials were conceived and designed through international collaboration. Although the individual trials have different primary outcomes for reasons of sample size and feasibility, all trials will collect a standard set of outcomes including survival without severe neonatal morbidity at time of hospital discharge. This is a summary of all the STRIDER trial protocols and provides an example of a prospectively planned international clinical research collaboration. All five individual trials will contribute to a pre-planned systematic review of the topic including individual patient data meta-analysis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONS: New Zealand and Australia: ACTRN12612000584831 .

We compared spinal and epidural anesthesia retrospectively in the operations of hip fracture in patients above the age of 85.METHODS: Two hundred and eighteen operations from April 1995 to September 2003 in our hospital were examined. Epidural anesthesia was scheduled in 94 operations, and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in 86 operations. Successful anesthetic cases of each group were compared. Blood pressure, heart rate, doses of vasopressors used were recorded before anesthesia and first and second 30-minute periods after anesthesia.RESULTS: Failed anesthetic cases in epidural anesthesia were significantly more than those in spinal anesthesia. Blood pressure in the first 30-minute period after epidural anesthesia was significantly lower than that after spinal anesthesia.CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anesthesia is preferable for the operation for hip fracture compared with epidural anesthesia, because of fewer failed cases and smaller decreases of blood pressure.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anesthesia, Epidural', 'Anesthesia, Spinal', 'Blood Pressure', 'Female', 'Geriatrics', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip Fractures', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",15966381,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E03.155.086.131'], ['E03.155.086.331'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['H02.403.355'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['C26.404.061.425', 'C26.531.750', 'C26.558.276.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

17967,Time Warping Solutions for Classifying Artifacts in EEG.,"The most common brain-computer interface (BCI) devices use electroencephalography (EEG). EEG signals are noisy owing to the presence of many artifacts, namely head movement, and facial movements like eye blinks or jaw movements. Removal of these artifacts from EEG signals is essential for the success of any downstream BCI application. These artifacts influence different sensors of the EEG. In this paper, we devise algorithms for detection and classification of artifacts. Classification of artifacts into head nod, jaw movement and eye-blink is performed using two different varieties of time warping; namely, linear time warping, and dynamic time warping. The average accuracy of 85% and 90% is obtained using the former, and the later, respectively.","['Algorithms', 'Artifacts', 'Blinking', 'Electroencephalography', 'Humans', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted']",31946874,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['E05.047'], ['G11.561.731.127', 'G14.152'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.800']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
29138,Cancer-associated genes can affect somatic intrachromosomal recombination early in carcinogenesis.,"The pKZ1 recombination mutagenesis model has provided a sensitive assay where we study somatic intrachromosomal recombination (SICR) as a mutation end-point. SICR is associated with non-homologous end-joining repair of double-strand breaks and can result in chromosomal inversions and deletions, both of which are common chromosomal aberrations identified in cancers. It has been difficult to study the effect of cancer-associated genes on chromosomal changes prior to tumour formation in vivo because of a lack of appropriate test systems. We hypothesised that cancer-associated genes play a role in formation of chromosomal aberrations and that the pKZ1 model would provide a system in which such a role could be studied in the initial steps of carcinogenesis. Transgenic tumour model mice were bred to pKZ1 mice to produce double transgenic animals. SICR inversion events were scored in mouse tissues at an early time, prior to evident tumour formation, and compared with endogenous pKZ1 SICR levels. Over-expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene resulted in a significant 2.1-fold increase in SICR in spleen. Loss of Msh2 and expression of the SV40 T antigen resulted in a significantly reduced SICR frequency (0.3 of the endogenous frequency in pKZ1 mice) in spleen and prostate respectively. Therefore SICR was affected in the case of all three cancer-associated genes studied. We hypothesise that the increase and decrease in SICR in the presence of cancer-associated genes results from incorrect repairing of double-strand breaks. The data presented here suggest that the pKZ1 model may provide a powerful tool for studying the effect of cancer-associated genes on chromosomal changes in the early stages of carcinogenesis.","['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genotype', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasms', 'Prostate', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Spleen']",15135636,"[['B01.050'], ['C23.550.210', 'G05.365.590.175'], ['C23.550.210.190', 'G05.365.590.175.190', 'G05.365.590.770.500', 'G05.558.805.500'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['G05.365.590.762.320', 'G05.558.800.320'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['D08.811.074.844.750', 'D08.811.277.040.025.292.750', 'D12.776.260.556.750', 'D12.776.624.664.700.130'], ['G05.558'], ['C04'], ['A05.360.444.575', 'A10.336.707'], ['D12.776.624.664.700'], ['D12.776.260.103.813', 'D12.776.624.664.700.189', 'D12.776.660.765', 'D12.776.930.125.813'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500.791'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.760'], ['D12.776.543.750.690.725', 'D12.776.543.750.705.852.760.505'], ['G05.728'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Multivariable transition-specific Cox models demonstrated that DM significantly increased the risk for transition from ""start-to-HCC"" (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-1.59; P < 0.001), ""start-to-death"" (aHR 2.61; 95% CI: 2.05-3.33; P < 0.001), and ""HCC-to-death"" (aHR 1.36; 95% CI 1.10-1.68; P = 0.005). The effect of liver cirrhosis on ""start-to-HCC"" and ""start-to-death"" transitions decreased over time, particularly within 2 years.CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus increased the risk of HCC development in HCV-infected patients and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with or without HCC.","['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diabetes Complications', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Female', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",27930829,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C19.246.099'], ['C18.452.394.750', 'C19.246'], ['C01.221.250.750.120', 'C01.925.440.440.120', 'C01.925.782.350.350.120', 'C06.552.380.350.120', 'C06.552.380.705.440.120'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['E05.318.740.600.800', 'G17.680.750', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
39226,Yield strength of fiber-reinforced composite posts with coronal retention.,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Currently, glass fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) posts with shank heads are only recommended for moderate coronal defects. Restoring endodontically treated teeth with large coronal defects remains a challenge, requiring posts with coronal retention and high bending resistance.PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the yield strengths of FRC posts and titanium posts (TI) with coronal retention for core foundations compared to FRC and TI posts without coronal retention.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tapered posts (ER root post system) of 4 diameters (ISO 50, 70, 90, 110), 2 lengths (tapered part: 9 and 12 mm) of identical shape, 2 materials (FRC, titanium), and 2 head designs (shank without retention (SH) and post head with horizontal retention (RET)) were evaluated (n=9). Titanium posts (TI-SH, TI-RET) served as the control. The 0.2% yield strengths (R(0.2)) of all specimens were tested in a universal testing machine. Three-way and 1-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni-Dunn's multiple comparison tests were performed (alpha=.05).RESULTS: The yield strengths of the control groups TI-RET were significantly higher for ISO 110 with a 9-mm length and for ISO 70 and 110 with a 12-mm length, compared to the respective FRC-RET posts (P<.001), whereas in all other groups, TI-RET and FRC-RET showed no significant differences. FRC-SH groups did not differ from FRC-RET groups. TI-SH showed significantly lower yield strength for ISO 70 compared to TI-RET, but significantly higher values for ISO 90 and 110 (P<.001).CONCLUSIONS: Head design of the tested FRC posts does not improve the yield strength, compared to FRC posts with a shank design. The diameter of the posts had a significant effect on the yield strengths of RET as well as SH groups.","['Composite Resins', 'Dental Prosthesis Design', 'Dental Prosthesis Retention', 'Dental Stress Analysis', 'Glass', 'Humans', 'Post and Core Technique', 'Tensile Strength', 'Titanium', 'Tooth Crown', 'Tooth, Nonvital']",19463665,"[['D05.750.716.822.308', 'D25.339.816.500', 'D25.720.716.822.308', 'J01.637.051.339.816.500', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.308'], ['E06.780.346.625', 'E06.912.145'], ['E06.780.346.687'], ['E06.308'], ['J01.637.437'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E06.780.346.250.500', 'E07.695.190.088.500'], ['G01.374.850'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800'], ['A14.549.167.900.710'], ['C07.793.237.910']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
8777,Evaluation of three behavioural economics 'nudges' on grocery and convenience store sales of promoted nutritious foods.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between three behavioural economics 'nudges' and store sales of promoted healthier foods.DESIGN: Multiple interrupted time series.SETTING: Two predominantly rural counties in central North Carolina, USA.PARTICIPANTS: Aggregated store transaction data from two grocery stores (one intervention, one control) and two convenience stores (one intervention, one control) were analysed using ANOVA to examine the association between three 'nudges' and store sales of promoted items. The nudges included: a 'cognitive fatigue' experiment, in which floor arrows guided customers to the produce sections; a 'scarcity' experiment, in which one sign in one area of the produce section portrayed a 'limited amount' message; and a 'product placement' experiment, where granola bars were moved into the candy bar aisle.RESULTS: In convenience stores, there were no significant differences between sales of the promoted items during the intervention period for any of the nudges when implemented individually. However, compared with baseline sales, implementation of all three nudges simultaneously was associated with an increase in sales during the intervention period based on proportional computations (P = 0·001), whereas no significant changes in sales were observed in the control convenience store. Among the grocery stores, there were no significant differences in sales during the intervention period for any of the nudges or the combined intervention compared with baseline sales.CONCLUSIONS: Implementing three nudges concurrently in a convenience store setting may increase sales of promoted items. However, before stores consider implementing these nudges to increase sales of nutritious foods, additional research is warranted.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Choice Behavior', 'Commerce', 'Consumer Behavior', 'Diet', 'Economics, Behavioral', 'Female', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Food Supply', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'North Carolina', 'Nutritive Value', 'Rural Population', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",31331404,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['F02.463.785.373.346'], ['J01.219'], ['F01.145.236'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['F04.096.628.286', 'N03.219.215'], ['G07.203.300', 'J02.500'], ['F01.145.407.516', 'G07.203.650.353.516'], ['J01.576.423.750'], ['I02.233.332.445', 'N02.421.726.407.579'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.107.567.875.075.475', 'Z01.107.567.875.750.530'], ['G07.203.650.660', 'J01.576.423.850.730.750', 'N06.850.601.750'], ['N01.600.725'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
12970,Levetiracetam inhibits neurotransmitter release associated with CICR.,"To define the antiepileptic mechanisms of levetiracetam (LEV), the present study determined the concentration-dependent effects of locally perfused LEV on the releases of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, l-glutamate and GABA induced by 50 mMK(+)-evoked stimulation and agonists of ryanodine receptor (RyR) and inositol-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) in the median prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using in vivo microdialysis. Local perfusion with LEV (10, 30 and 100 ìM) alone did not affect the extracellular levels of all neurotransmitters in the mPFC. The release of neurotransmitters induced by K(+)-evoked stimulation was inhibited by perfusion with LEV in a concentration-dependent manner, and those induced by agonists of RyR and IP3R were also inhibited by LEV. Specifically, the RyR-induced release was inhibited by 10 ìM LEV, whereas the IP3R-induced release was inhibited by 100 ìM LEV, but not by 10 or 30 ìM LEV. The above results suggest that LEV has little effect on the components of normal synaptic transmission but selectively inhibits transmission induced by neuronal hyperactivation. Thus, the mechanisms of the antiepileptic and neuroprotective actions of LEV seem to be mediated, at least in part, through the combination of these two inhibitory effects on depolarization-induced and CICR-associated neurotransmitter releases.","['Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Levetiracetam', 'Male', 'Microdialysis', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Piracetam', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Synaptic Transmission']",22484014,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.427.080'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.760', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.760', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.760', 'D12.776.826.179'], ['D02.065.064.432', 'D02.241.081.018.110.463', 'D03.383.773.812.362'], ['E05.196.353.500'], ['D27.505.519.625', 'D27.505.696.577'], ['D02.065.064.650', 'D02.241.081.018.110.650', 'D03.383.773.812.555'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.800', 'D12.776.210.500.800', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.800', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.800'], ['G02.111.820.850', 'G04.835.850', 'G07.265.880', 'G11.561.830']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
47824,Risk of death or acute myocardial infarction 10 years after coronary artery bypass surgery in relation to type of diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the long-term risk of death or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared with that in patients without DM after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).METHODS: National registers were used to record death or AMI occurring in 6727 patients who had CABG during 1980 to 1995. Diabetes mellitus in 856 patients (13%) was classified as type 1 (6%) or type 2 treated with insulin (29%), oral drugs (46%), or diet (19%).RESULTS: The risk of death < or = 30 days of the operation was increased in patients with insulin-treated type 2 DM (odds ratio [OR] 4.6, 95% CI 2.5-8.4) and in those on oral antidiabetic drugs (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.8), but not in diet-treated diabetic patients, compared with that in patients without diabetes. At 10 years, the relative risk of death or having an AMI was 1.8 (95% CI 1.5-2.2) in insulin-treated patients and 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.7) in patients on oral drugs. No increased risk of late death or AMI was observed in diet-treated patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes. Survival at 10 years without an AMI was 40% in insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients, 48% if on oral drugs, and 59% if diet managed, compared with 66% in nondiabetic patients.CONCLUSION: Type 2 DM requiring insulin treatment or oral antidiabetic drugs is associated with an increased early and long-term risk of death or AMI after CABG, whereas diet-treated patients have a risk similar to that in patients without diabetes.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",16923437,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.250', 'N01.224.935.698.100', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.250', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.250'], ['E04.100.376.719.332', 'E04.100.814.868.750', 'E04.928.220.520.220'], ['C18.452.394.750.124', 'C19.246.267', 'C20.111.327'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40181,Feather mites are potentially an important source of allergens for pigeon and budgerigar keepers.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies on allergy to feathers have not addressed whether organisms living on feathers (mites, lice, moulds) are a source of allergens.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether feather mites produced allergens of clinical relevance to bird keepers.METHODS: We examined serum IgE responses of 96 pigeon breeders to an extract of feather mites from pigeons (predominantly Diplaegidia columbae), using Western blotting, specific IgE assay using AlaSTAT EIA and RAST inhibition.RESULTS: Feather mites are a major source of soluble proteins derived from feathers, accounting for up to 10% of the total weight of the feather. Forty-three sera had a negative score (0) for anti-feather mite IgE, 27 were weakly positive (1-2) and 26 had strongly positive scores (3-4). Fewer pigeon breeders with scores > or = 3 were asymptomatic than those with negative scores (12 versus 40%), more had late onset symptoms (with or without early onset symptoms: 77% versus 44%) and had IgE antibody against house dust mite (89% versus 23%). Western blotting of eight sera against the extract of Diplaegidia columbae revealed 20 IgE-binding components ranging from 22 to 200 kDa. A high diversity of components was recognized by each serum: arithmetic mean 7 (range 2-14). RAST inhibition indicated feather mites had species-specific epitopes as well as ones that cross-reacted with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.CONCLUSION: Strongly-positive AlaSTAT scores to pigeon feather mite were associated with allergic symptoms of late onset in pigeon breeders. We conclude that feather mites are a major source of clinically-relevant allergens for pigeon breeders.","['Allergens', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Dermatophagoides', ""Bird Fancier's Lung"", 'Blotting, Western', 'Columbidae', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Feathers', 'Glycoproteins', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Mites', 'Parrots', 'Radioallergosorbent Test']",9117882,"[['D23.050.063'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.050.181'], ['C08.381.483.125.125', 'C08.674.055.125', 'C20.543.480.680.075.125', 'C24.125'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.165.150'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['A13.370'], ['D09.400.430', 'D12.776.395'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.312', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.312', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.312'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['B01.050.500.131.166.132.419'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.710.672'], ['E01.370.225.812.735.830', 'E05.200.812.735.830', 'E05.478.566.380.810', 'E05.478.566.639.810', 'E05.478.594.760.830', 'E05.601.470.380.810', 'E05.601.470.639.810']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5564,[Reduction of atherogenesis in an arterialized venous graft by using an external sleeve].,"The parietal thickening of a vein under hemodynamical conditions in the arterial system can be reduced when supporting the vein with a rigid external sleeve. To assess the role of thickness reduction in atherogenesis of an arterialized vein graft, a 4 mm thick external sleeve was implemented around the proximal half of a carotid-carotid vein graft in 16 New Zealand rabbits. Eleven rabbits were submitted to a hypercholesterolemic diet (HC group), while five others were submitted to a normal cholesterol diet (NC group). After eight weeks, a statistically significant difference in thickness was observed between free and sleeved segments, in the NC group with 105 +/- 9 microns versus 65 +/- 6 microns (p < 10.0001) respectively as well as in the HC group with 180 +/- 37 microns versus 99 +/- 35 microns (p < 10.0001) respectively. Studying the extent of soudanophilic lesions showed a statistically significant difference according to the use or not of an external sleeve where average extent is 68 +/- 17% in free segments versus 31 +/- 26% (p < 10.0001) is sleeved segments. The reduction in vein overfullness using an external constrictive sleeve prevents structural parietal changes in the vein and allows reducing atherogenesis of the arterialized vein graft.","['Animals', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Hypercholesterolemia', 'Rabbits', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Veins']",1345700,"[['B01.050'], ['C14.907.137.126'], ['A07.015.114.186'], ['E02.183', 'N05.715.360.330.125'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['C18.452.584.500.500.396'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['E04.936.664'], ['A07.015.908']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In the present study, we assessed the mRNA expression levels of KLK6 and KLK8 by quantitative PCR in 100 patients with advanced serous ovarian cancer FIGO stage III/IV. A pronounced correlation between KLK6 and KLK8 mRNA expression (rs = 0.636, p < 0.001) was observed, indicating coordinate expression of both peptidases. No significant associations of clinical parameters with KLK6, KLK8, and a combined score KLK6+KLK8 were found. In univariate Cox regression analysis, elevated mRNA levels of KLK6 were significantly linked with shortened overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.07, p = 0.007). While KLK8 values were not associated with patients' outcome, high KLK6+KLK8 values were significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival (HR = 1.82, p = 0.047) and showed a trend towards significance in the case of OS (HR = 1.82, p = 0.053). Strikingly, in multivariable analysis, elevated KLK6 mRNA values, apart from residual tumor mass, remained an independent predictive marker for poor OS (HR = 2.33, p = 0.005). As KLK6 mRNA and protein levels correlate, KLK6 may represent an attractive therapeutic target for potent and specific inhibitors of its enzymatic activity.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kallikreins', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Young Adult']",27483364,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['G05.308.370'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.442', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.442', 'D12.776.124.125.597', 'D23.119.597'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['C04.588.322.455', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705', 'C13.351.937.418.685', 'C19.344.410', 'C19.391.630.705'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
6375,[Test-retest reliability of a web-based colour vision test].,"BACKGROUND: Screening tests should be simple, with high acceptance, low costs and offer a high sensitivity and specificity as well as high reliability. The test-retest reliability of a web-based colour vision test was evaluated.METHOD: The results of 386 subjects, who had performed the web-based colour vision test with 25 colour plates twice (available at http://www.farbsehtest.de), were analysed from an mySQL data base. Retests were performed spontaneously, normally on the same day, or through an email newsletter with a request to repeat the test. Test-retest reliability was assessed by calculating the kappa coefficient and the corresponding confidence interval. The McNemar test was used as a complementary procedure to detect the presence of systematic differences between test results.RESULTS: The kappa coefficient rises with increasing time interval between the first test performance and the test repetition. Thus it was 0.24 when the test was repeated within one hour (confidence interval 0.07 - 0.41, n = 63), it increases to 0.83 (confidence interval 0.75 - 0.92, n = 240) in the subjects who repeated the test at the earliest after two years. While the proportion of failed tests (< 3 mistakes) in the second test performance markedly decreases when the test is repeated in the short term within one hour (p < 0.001, McNemar), we were unable to identify any systematic differences (p = 0.602) for a time interval of more than one day.CONCLUSIONS: The web-based colour vision test is a reliable screening test with good reproducible results as well under uncontrolled examination conditions. Subjects must perform the test with serious intent and should not aim at a positive test result by training or manipulation because of self-delusion. Test results are reliable if the time interval between test and retest is more than one day.","['Color Perception Tests', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Mass Screening', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Reproducibility of Results']",20602298,"[['E01.370.380.850.150'], ['E01.158', 'L01.313.500.750.100.158'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.230.110.500'], ['E01.370.500', 'E05.318.308.980.438.580', 'N02.421.726.233.443', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.580', 'N06.850.780.500'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
22269,Overactivation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors through entorhinal-hippocampal connection initiates accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in rat hippocampus after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.,"Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induces secondary damages in the hippocampus that is remote from primary ischemic regions. Tau hyperphosphorylation is an important risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Increased tau phosphorylation has been identified in ischemic cortex, but little is known regarding the changes in the hippocampus. We showed that unilateral transient MCAO induced accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and concurrent dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3â at Ser 9 in the ipsilateral hippocampus. These MCAO-induced changes were not reproduced when glutamatergic inputs from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus were transected; however, the changes were mimicked by intrahippocampal N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) administration. Inhibition of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit NR2B, but not NR2A activity in the hippocampus attenuated the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and spatial cognitive impairment in MCAO rats. Together, our data suggest that overactivation of NR2B-containing NMDARs through entorhinal-hippocampal connection plays an important role in the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus following MCAO. Glycogen synthase kinase-3â is an important protein kinase involved in NMDARs-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation. This study indicates that early inhibition of NR2B-containing NMDARs may represent a potential strategy to prevent or delay the occurrence of post-stroke dementia. Middle cerebral artery occlusion induces secondary damage in the hippocampus that is remote from primary ischemic regions. We propose that excessive activation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors through entorhinal-hippocampal connection initiated the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus, which subsequently induced cognitive deficit. This study provides new insights into the prospects of NR2B inhibition in stoke therapy.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Entorhinal Cortex', 'Functional Laterality', 'Hippocampus', 'Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate', 'tau Proteins']",25903928,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A08.186.211.180.590.750.225', 'A08.186.211.180.710.225', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.382.750.225', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.620.562', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.814.695.374', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.750.562'], ['F02.830.297.425', 'G11.561.225.425'], ['A08.186.211.180.405', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.345'], ['C10.228.140.300.150.477.200.450', 'C10.228.140.300.510.200.387', 'C10.228.140.300.775.200.200.450', 'C14.907.253.092.477.200.450', 'C14.907.253.560.200.387', 'C14.907.253.855.200.200.450', 'C23.550.513.355.250.200.450', 'C23.550.717.489.250.200.450'], ['A08.612'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.500'], ['D12.776.220.600.450.510', 'D12.776.631.560.510']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45199,In Vitro Model of Coronary Angiogenesis.,"Here, we describe an in vitro culture assay to study coronary angiogenesis. Coronary vessels feed the heart muscle and are of clinical importance. Defects in these vessels represent severe health risks such as in atherosclerosis, which can lead to myocardial infarctions and heart failures in patients. Consequently, coronary artery disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Despite its clinical importance, relatively little progress has been made on how to regenerate damaged coronary arteries. Nevertheless, recent progress has been made in understanding the cellular origin and differentiation pathways of coronary vessel development. The advent of tools and technologies that allow researchers to fluorescently label progenitor cells, follow their fate, and visualize progenies in vivo have been instrumental in understanding coronary vessel development. In vivo studies are valuable, but have limitations in terms of speed, accessibility, and flexibility in experimental design. Alternatively, accurate in vitro models of coronary angiogenesis can circumvent these limitations and allow researchers to interrogate important biological questions with speed and flexibility. The lack of appropriate in vitro model systems may have hindered the progress in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of coronary vessel growth. Here, we describe an in vitro culture system to grow coronary vessels from the sinus venosus (SV) and endocardium (Endo), the two progenitor tissues from which many of the coronary vessels arise. We also confirmed that the cultures accurately recapitulate some of the known in vivo mechanisms. For instance, we show that the angiogenic sprouts in culture from SV downregulate COUP-TFII expression similar to what is observed in vivo. In addition, we show that VEGF-A, a well-known angiogenic factor in vivo, robustly stimulates angiogenesis from both the SV and Endo cultures. Collectively, we have devised an accurate in vitro culture model to study coronary angiogenesis.","['Animals', 'COUP Transcription Factor II', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Dissection', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Heart', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Pregnancy', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A']",32225157,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.260.643.039.500', 'D12.776.260.703.200', 'D12.776.826.209.039.500', 'D12.776.930.780.750'], ['G04.152.262', 'G05.135'], ['A07.015.114.269', 'A07.015.908.194'], ['E01.370.225.998.221', 'E04.221', 'E05.200.998.221'], ['A16.254'], ['A11.284.295.310'], ['A07.541'], ['A07.541.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['G09.330.630'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E05.481.500.617'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.720', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.720', 'E05.200.500.620.760.720', 'E05.200.750.600.760.720'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The pathogenesis is still unknown and therefore the question of the right therapy is not resolved.MATERIAL: With a case report of a patient with recurrence after two arthroscopic synovectomies, PVNS is discussed against the background of the clinical, histological, and radiological features.RESULTS: We performed an open synovectomy and cystic lesions in both condyles of the femur and proximal tibia were filled with homologous and autologous cancellous bone. Three months later the patient had no pain and the bone density in the former cystic lesions was appropriate.DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis is still unknown. Diagnosis often is obtained much too late due to missing specific symptoms. PVNS occurs in local forms as well as in a diffuse growth pattern. Recurrence rates of up to 78% are very high. Besides arthroscopic and open synovectomy, the treatment with radiosynoviorthesis must be considered.

48848,The role of arginine metabolic pathway during embryogenesis and germination in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.).,"Vegetative propagation through somatic embryogenesis is critical in conifer biotechnology towards multivarietal forestry that uses elite varieties to cope with environmental and socio-economic issues. An important and still sub-optimal process during in vitro maturation of somatic embryos (SE) is the biosynthesis and deposition of storage proteins, which are rich in amino acids with high nitrogen (N) content, such as arginine. Mobilization of these N-rich proteins is essential for the germination and production of vigorous somatic seedlings. Somatic embryos accumulate lower levels of N reserves than zygotic embryos (ZE) at a similar stage of development. To understand the molecular basis for this difference, the arginine metabolic pathway has been characterized in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.). The genes involved in arginine metabolism have been identified and GFP-fusion constructs were used to locate the enzymes in different cellular compartments and clarify their metabolic roles during embryogenesis and germination. Analysis of gene expression during somatic embryo maturation revealed high levels of transcripts for genes involved in the biosynthesis and metabolic utilization of arginine. By contrast, enhanced expression levels were only observed during the last stages of maturation and germination of ZE, consistent with the adequate accumulation and mobilization of protein reserves. These results suggest that arginine metabolism is unbalanced in SE (simultaneous biosynthesis and degradation of arginine) and could explain the lower accumulation of storage proteins observed during the late stages of somatic embryogenesis.","['Arginine', 'Germination', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Pinus']",29112758,"[['D12.125.068.050', 'D12.125.095.104', 'D12.125.142.087'], ['G07.345.625.249', 'G15.357'], ['G03.493'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.625.875.777']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45978,Secular trends in occurrence of acute venous thromboembolism: the Worcester VTE study (1985-2009).,"BACKGROUND: The clinical epidemiology of venous thromboembolism has changed recently because of advances in identification, prophylaxis, and treatment. We sought to describe secular trends in the occurrence of venous thromboembolism among residents of the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan statistical area.METHODS: Population-based methods were used to monitor trends in event rates of first-time or recurrent venous thromboembolism in 5025 Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan statistical area residents who were diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism or lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis during 9 annual periods between 1985 and 2009. Medical records were reviewed by abstractors and validated by clinicians.RESULTS: Age- and sex-adjusted annual event rates for first-time venous thromboembolism increased from 73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-82) per 100,000 in 1985/1986 to 133 (CI, 122-143) in 2009, primarily because of an increase in pulmonary embolism. The rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism decreased from 39 (CI, 32-45) in 1985/1986 to 19 (CI, 15-23) in 2003, and then increased to 35 (CI, 29-40) in 2009. There was an increasing trend in using noninvasive diagnostic testing, with approximately half of tests being invasive in 1985/1986 and almost all noninvasive by 2009.CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in identification, prophylaxis, and treatment between 1985 and 2009, the annual event rate of venous thromboembolism has increased and remains high. Although these increases partially may be due to increased sensitivity of diagnostic methods, especially for pulmonary embolism, they also may imply that current prevention and treatment strategies are less than optimal.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Massachusetts', 'Middle Aged', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Population Surveillance', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Regression Analysis', 'Venous Thromboembolism', 'Venous Thrombosis']",24813864,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['N03.219.151.165', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.182', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.046'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.107.567.875.550.510'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.994.750', 'G17.820.750', 'N05.715.360.750.750.620', 'N06.850.520.830.994.750'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['C08.381.746', 'C14.907.355.350.700'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['C14.907.355.590.700'], ['C14.907.355.830.925']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
23838,Antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide in a renal cell carcinoma model.,"The aim of this study was to determine the antitumor and antiangiogenic effects of the Schisandra chinensis polysaccharides (SCP) in selected renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells and evaluate its potential mechanism of action. In vitro, endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by Caki-1 was blockaded in response to SCP treatment for 48h. In vivo, a significant tumor growth inhibition effect was observed after SCP administration for 4 weeks. Moreover, SCP treatment decreased the level of VEGF, CD31 and CD34 in RCC tumor tissues. Further analysis of the tumor inhibition mechanism indicated that the number of apoptotic tumor cells increased significantly; the expression of Bax and p53 increased; and the expression of Bcl-2 decreased dramatically in transplanted tumor tissues following SCP administration. These results indicated that the potential mechanisms involved by which SCP exerted its antitumor and antiangiogenic activity might be associated with the up-regulation of Bax and p53, downregulation of Bcl-2, as well as the reduction of VEGF, CD31 and CD34 in xenografted tumors. These findings demonstrated that the SCP is a potential antitumor agent for RCC treatment.","['Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Polysaccharides', 'Schisandra', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",24556120,"[['D27.505.696.377.077.099', 'D27.505.696.377.450.100', 'D27.505.954.248.025'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.050.301.264.035.134', 'D23.101.100.110.134'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.390', 'C04.588.945.947.535.160', 'C12.758.820.750.160', 'C12.777.419.473.160', 'C13.351.937.820.535.160', 'C13.351.968.419.473.160'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.945.947.535', 'C12.758.820.750', 'C12.777.419.473', 'C13.351.937.820.535', 'C13.351.968.419.473'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['C23.550.589.500'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.131', 'D12.776.543.550.200.131', 'D23.050.301.264.900.131', 'D23.050.301.350.131', 'D23.101.100.900.131'], ['D09.698'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.103.500.750'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845'], ['G02.111.905', 'G05.308.850', 'G07.690.773.998'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200'], ['D12.644.360.075.718.400', 'D12.776.476.075.718.400']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

26384,Activation of the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway facilitates Na+ translocation by the Na+-K+ pump in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes.,"1. The effects of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin on steady-state and transient currents generated by the Na+-K+ pump were studied in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes by means of whole-cell voltage clamp at 30 C. 2. In external solution containing 144 mM Na+ (Na+o) and 10 mM K+ (K+o), steady-state Na+-K+ pump current (Ip) activated by 5 mM pipette Na+ (Na+pip) at -20 mV was reversibly augmented by forskolin (4 microM) to 133 +/- 4 % of the control current (n = 15). The forskolin analogue 1, 9-dideoxyforskolin (10 microM), which does not activate adenylyl cyclases, did not increase Ip (n = 2). Application of the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 (10 microM) in the continued presence of forskolin reversed the forskolin-induced elevation of Ip (n = 3). 3. The forskolin effect on Ip persisted in the presence of 50 mM Na+pip which ensured that the internal Na+-binding sites of the Na+-K+ pump were nearly saturated. Under these conditions, the drug increased Ip to 142 +/- 3 % of the control Ip when the pipette free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]pip) was 0.013 nM (n = 5) and to 138 +/- 4 % of the control Ip when free [Ca2+]pip was 15 nM (n = 9). 4. In Na+-free external solution, Ip activated by 50 mM Na+pip and 1.5 mM K+o was likewise increased by forskolin but to a lesser extent than in Na+-containing medium (116 +/- 3 % of control, n = 10). 5. In order to investigate exclusively partial reactions in the Na+ limb of the pump cycle, transient pump currents under conditions of electroneutral Na+-Na+ exchange were studied. Transient pump currents elicited by voltage jumps displayed an initial peak and then decayed monoexponentially. Moved charge (Q) and the rate constant of current decay varied with membrane potential (V). The Q-V relationship followed a Boltzmann distribution characterized by the midpoint voltage (V0.5) and the maximum amount of movable charge (DeltaQmax). Forskolin (2-10 microM) shifted V0.5 to more negative values while DeltaQmax was not affected (n = 11). The effects of forskolin on transient pump currents were mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP (500 microM; n = 2) and abolished by a peptide inhibitor of PKA (PKI, 10 microM; n = 5). 6. We conclude that activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes increases Na+-K+ pump current at least in part by modulating partial reactions in the Na+ limb of the pump cycle. Under physiological conditions, the observed stimulation of the cardiac Na+-K+ pump may serve to shorten the action potential duration and to counteract the increased passive sarcolemmal Na+ and K+ fluxes during sympathetic stimulation of the heart.","['Adenylyl Cyclases', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrophysiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Isoquinolines', 'Myocardium', 'Sodium', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase', 'Sulfonamides']",10718738,"[['D08.811.520.650.200', 'D12.644.360.050', 'D12.776.476.050'], ['B01.050'], ['G03.143'], ['A11.251'], ['D02.455.849.291.300'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.150.125', 'D12.644.360.200.125', 'D12.776.476.200.125'], ['G01.358.500.249.277'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['A07.541.560'], ['D03.633.100.531'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.750', 'D12.776.157.530.450.162.780', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.880', 'D12.776.157.530.813.750', 'D12.776.543.585.450.162.800', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.890', 'D12.776.543.585.813.750'], ['D02.065.884', 'D02.886.590.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
8878,"Antimicrobial Peptides, Polymorphic Toxins, and Self-Nonself Recognition Systems in Archaea: an Untapped Armory for Intermicrobial Conflicts.","Numerous, diverse, highly variable defense and offense genetic systems are encoded in most bacterial genomes and are involved in various forms of conflict among competing microbes or their eukaryotic hosts. Here we focus on the offense and self-versus-nonself discrimination systems encoded by archaeal genomes that so far have remained largely uncharacterized and unannotated. Specifically, we analyze archaeal genomic loci encoding polymorphic and related toxin systems and ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides. Using sensitive methods for sequence comparison and the ""guilt by association"" approach, we identified such systems in 141 archaeal genomes. These toxins can be classified into four major groups based on the structure of the components involved in the toxin delivery. The toxin domains are often shared between and within each system. We revisit halocin families and substantially expand the halocin C8 family, which was identified in diverse archaeal genomes and also certain bacteria. Finally, we employ features of protein sequences and genomic locus organization characteristic of archaeocins and polymorphic toxins to identify candidates for analogous but not necessarily homologous systems among uncharacterized protein families. This work confidently predicts that more than 1,600 archaeal proteins, currently annotated as ""hypothetical"" in public databases, are components of conflict and self-versus-nonself discrimination systems.IMPORTANCE Diverse and highly variable systems involved in biological conflicts and self-versus-nonself discrimination are ubiquitous in bacteria but much less studied in archaea. We performed comprehensive comparative genomic analyses of the archaeal systems that share components with analogous bacterial systems and propose an approach to identify new systems that could be involved in these functions. We predict polymorphic toxin systems in 141 archaeal genomes and identify new, archaea-specific toxin and immunity protein families. These systems are widely represented in archaea and are predicted to play major roles in interactions between species and in intermicrobial conflicts. This work is expected to stimulate experimental research to advance the understanding of poorly characterized major aspects of archaeal biology.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Archaea', 'Archaeal Proteins', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genome, Archaeal', 'Genome, Bacterial', 'Genomics', 'Microbial Interactions', 'Toxins, Biological']",31064832,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D12.644.050', 'D12.776.543.695.054'], ['B02'], ['D12.776.090'], ['D12.776.097'], ['G05.045.250', 'G16.075.250'], ['G05.360.340.358.050'], ['G05.360.340.358.207'], ['H01.158.273.180.350', 'H01.158.273.343.350'], ['G06.550'], ['D23.946']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

20137,"Anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody treatment induces long-term, tissue-specific, immunologic hyporesponsiveness to peripheral nerve allografts.","The CD40/CD40L costimulatory pathway plays a crucial role in allograft rejection. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment as a method to induce long-term, tissue-specific, immunologic hyporesponsiveness to peripheral nerve allografts. Sciatic nerve allografts were performed from BALB/c donor mice into C57BL/6 recipients. Anti-CD40L mAb (1 mg) was administered intraperitoneally to recipient mice on postoperative days 0, 1, and 2. After a 14-, 28-, or 60-day recovery period, the mice were rechallenged with either a BALB/c cardiac or peripheral nerve allograft. Rejection was assessed by measuring the production of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-2, -4, and -5, and alloantibodies immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG. IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IgM, and IgG responses were much lower in the anti-CD40L mAb group compared with controls. Nerve allograft and nerve isograft rechallenge 60 days following the original nerve allotransplantation produced low cytokine responses, whereas cardiac allograft rechallenge produced high cytokine production, indicative of acute rejection. Short-term anti-CD40L treatment may cause long-term, tissue-specific, immunologic hyporesponsiveness. This may allow time for native axons to traverse the transplanted nerve allograft and replace the graft with autogenous peripheral nerve tissue.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cytokines', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Sciatic Nerve', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",18459087,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['D12.644.276.374.750.124', 'D12.776.395.550.185', 'D12.776.467.374.750.124', 'D12.776.543.550.198', 'D23.529.374.750.124'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['G12.875.545.328'], ['G12.875.545.340'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.574', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.574', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.574'], ['E02.319.267.530.490'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['A08.800.800.720.450.760'], ['E04.936.864']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7709,MCP-1 (CCL2) protects human neurons and astrocytes from NMDA or HIV-tat-induced apoptosis.,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated dementia is often characterized by chronic inflammation, with infected macrophage infiltration of the CNS resulting in the production of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) products, including tat, and neurotoxins that contribute to neuronal loss. In addition to their established role in leukocyte recruitment and activation, we identified an additional role for chemokines in the CNS. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2) and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were found to protect mixed cultures of human neurons and astrocytes from tat or NMDA-induced apoptosis. Neuronal and astrocytic apoptosis in these cultures was significantly inhibited by co-treatment with MCP-1 or RANTES but not IP-10. The protective effect of RANTES was blocked by antibodies to MCP-1, indicating that RANTES protection is mediated by the induction of MCP-1. The NMDA blocker, MK801, also abolished the toxic effects of both tat and NMDA. Tat or NMDA treatment of mixed cultures for 24 h resulted in increased extracellular glutamate ([Glu]e) and NMDA receptor 1 (NMDAR1) expression, potential contributors to apoptosis. Co-treatment with MCP-1 inhibited tat and NMDA-induced increases in [Glu]e and NMDAR1, and also reduced the levels and number of neurons containing intracellular tat. These data indicate that MCP-1 may play a novel role as a protective agent against the toxic effects of glutamate and tat.","['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Apoptosis', 'Astrocytes', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Chemokine CCL5', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dizocilpine Maleate', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists', 'Gene Products, tat', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Humans', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",12753088,"[['C01.221.250.875.049', 'C01.221.812.640.400.070', 'C01.778.640.400.070', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.049', 'C01.925.813.400.070', 'C10.228.140.380.070', 'C20.673.480.070', 'F03.615.400.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['A08.637.200', 'A11.650.200'], ['A11.251'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.110.990.600', 'D12.776.467.374.200.110.990.600', 'D23.125.300.110.990.600', 'D23.469.200.110.990.600', 'D23.529.374.200.110.990.500'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.110.250', 'D12.776.467.374.200.110.250', 'D23.125.300.110.250', 'D23.469.200.110.250', 'D23.529.374.200.110.250'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.181.384.380', 'D04.615.181.384.380'], ['D27.505.519.625.190.300', 'D27.505.696.577.190.300'], ['D12.776.260.755.199', 'D12.776.930.900.199', 'D12.776.964.900.750.750', 'D12.776.964.925.984.400'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.125.067.500.400', 'D12.125.119.170.400'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.500'], ['D12.776.260.755.199.500', 'D12.776.930.900.199.500', 'D12.776.964.775.562.773', 'D12.776.964.900.750.750.500', 'D12.776.964.925.984.400.500']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
12712,"Neurotrophins 3 and 4 differentially regulate NCAM, L1 and N-cadherin expression during peripheral nerve regeneration.","The addition of NT-3 (neurotrophin 3) or NT-4 to injured nerves improves their regeneration potential and may aid axon guidance. It is not well defined whether NTs (neurotrophins) influence other elements, such as the cell-adhesion molecules, which promote nerve guidance and regeneration. Using poly-3-hydroxybutyrate conduits, we applied either NT-3 or NT-4 to axotomized rat sciatic nerves and monitored nerve regeneration and cell-adhesion molecule expression. Regenerating nerves were stained with antibodies against NCAM (neural cell-adhesion molecule) and N-cadherin 2 weeks after injury and staining intensity was quantified. NCAM, N-cadherin and L1 (L1 cell-adhesion molecule) transcription was measured in the proximal and distal stumps and ipsilateral DRG (dorsal root ganglia) (fourth and fifth DRG) using RT (reverse transcriptase)-PCR. Both NT-3 and NT-4 increased NCAM and L1 transcript levels in the DRG of axotomized nerves. This is reflected in the increased NCAM expression at the proximal stump and regeneration front. Increased levels of NCAM were also observed in the distal stump. NT-4 administration increased N-cadherin levels proximal to the injury, but not distally. Following NT-3 administration, N-cadherin expression decreased in proximal and distal stumps compared with the control. In conclusion, NTs differentially alter adhesion molecule expression in regenerating nerves and transcription in the corresponding DRG, although these changes in expression do not alter NT-enhanced regeneration. Thus we propose that retrograde transport of the NTs to the DRG affects adhesion molecule transcription, reflected by protein expression in peripheral nerve axons.","['Animals', 'Cadherins', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sciatic Nerve', 'Sciatic Neuropathy']",17640175,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200.200', 'D23.050.301.350.200'], ['D12.644.276.860', 'D12.776.467.860', 'D12.776.631.600', 'D23.529.850'], ['G11.561.585', 'G16.762.611'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.250.520.578', 'D12.776.543.550.200.250.520.578', 'D23.050.301.350.250.520.578'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.250.520', 'D12.776.543.550.200.250.520', 'D23.050.301.350.250.520'], ['D12.644.276.860.775', 'D12.776.467.860.775', 'D12.776.631.600.775', 'D23.529.850.775'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['A08.800.800.720.450.760'], ['C10.668.829.500.675']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
32136,Contractile properties of rat skeletal muscles following storage at 4 degrees C.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of preservation solutions for protecting skeletal muscle function during storage at 4 degrees C. The soleus and the cutaneus trunci (CT) from the rat were stored for 2, 8 or 16 h at 4 degrees C in University of Wisconsin solution (UW), HTK-Bretschneider solution (HTK) or Krebs-Henseleit solution (KH). After storage, muscles were stimulated electrically to analyse the isometric contractile properties, such as the maximum tetanic tension (P(0)). Histological analysis was also performed. In separate experiments, the effect of the diffusion distance on muscle preservation was studied by bisecting the soleus. After 8 h of storage in UW or HTK, the contractile properties of the CT were similar to those of the control, whereas those of the soleus were reduced (P(0) values of 16% and 69% of control in UW and HTK respectively). At 16 h, the contractile properties of the CT (P(O) 28%) were again better preserved than those of the soleus (P(0) 9%). Muscle function deteriorated most after storage in KH (P(0) at 16 h: soleus, 3%; CT, 17%). The bisected soleus was equally well preserved as the CT (P(O) of bisected soleus at 8 h in UW and HTK: 86%). The functional data corresponded well with the histological data, which showed increasing muscle fibre derangement with increasing storage time. For both muscles and all solutions, the threshold stimulus current increased with increasing storage time (control, 0.1 mA; 16 h, 1.2 mA) and was strongly correlated with the deterioration in contractile properties. It is concluded that, at 4 degrees C, muscle is preserved better in UW and HTK (intracellular-like solutions) than in KH (extracellular-like solution). The soleus and CT were best protected in HTK. The diffusion distance is a critical factor for successful preservation of muscle function at 4 degrees C. The reduced function after 16 h of storage at 4 degrees C was caused by hypercontraction and necrosis of about 25% of the muscle fibres, and by deterioration of the electrical component of excitation-contraction coupling of the remaining fibres.","['Animals', 'Cryopreservation', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fatigue', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",10369793,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.160', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.160', 'E02.792.156', 'E05.200.500.620.760.160', 'E05.200.750.600.760.160', 'E05.760.156'], ['E05.723.402'], ['G11.427.494'], ['G11.427.550'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
39844,Covalent binding of quinones activates the Ah receptor in Hepa1c1c7 cells.,"Highly reactive quinone species produced by photooxidation and/or metabolic activation of mono- or bi-aromatic hydrocarbons modulate cellular homeostasis and electrophilic signal transduction pathways through the covalent modification of proteins. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but not mono- or bi-aromatic hydrocarbons, are well recognized as ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). However, quinone species produced from mono- and bi-aromatic hydrocarbons could potentially cause AhR activation. To clarify the AhR response to mono- and bi-aromatic hydrocarbon quinones, we studied Cyp1a1 (cytochrome P450 1A1) induction and AhR activation by these quinones. We detected Cyp1a1 induction during treatment with quinones in Hepa1c1c7 cells, but not their parent compounds. Nine of the twelve quinones with covalent binding capability for proteins induced Cyp1a1. Cyp1a1 induction mediated by 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ), 1,4-NQ, 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ) and tert-butyl-1,4-BQ was suppressed by a specific AhR inhibitor and was not observed in c35 cells, which do not have a functional AhR. These quinones stimulated AhR nuclear translocation and interaction with the AhR nuclear translocator. Interestingly, 1,2-NQ covalently modified AhR, which was detected by an immunoprecipitation assay using a specific antibody against 1,2-NQ, resulting in enhancement of xenobiotic responsive element (XRE)-derived luciferase activity and binding of AhR to the Cyp1a1 promoter region. While mono- and bi-aromatic hydrocarbons are generally believed to be poor ligands for AhR and hence unable to induce Cyp1a1, our study suggests that the quinones of these molecules are able to modify AhR and activate the AhR/XRE pathway, thereby inducing Cyp1a1. Since we previously reported that 1,2-NQ and tert-butyl-1,4-BQ also activate NF-E2-related factor 2, it seems likely that some of quinones are bi-functional inducers for phase-I and phase-II reaction of xenobiotics.","['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Antioxidant Response Elements', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Quinones', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",26558468,"[['G03.143.310.100', 'G03.143.700.100'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675.700.040', 'G05.360.080.689.675.700.040', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680.765.040'], ['D12.776.157.530.750.100', 'D12.776.260.103.625.500', 'D12.776.543.585.750.100', 'D12.776.930.125.625.500'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['D08.244.453.005.332', 'D08.244.453.100.500', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.010.277', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.020.500', 'D12.776.422.220.453.010.332', 'D12.776.422.220.453.100.500'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.776.260.108.737', 'D12.776.930.127.737'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D02.806'], ['D12.776.260.643.715', 'D12.776.826.209.715', 'D12.776.930.760'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The mean RBC and WBC values in Lipizzans were in the lower part of the normal range for warm-blooded horses. The mean PCV, MCV and MCH values were higher, but the mean haemoglobin concentration and MCHC values were lower than reported for other warm-blooded horses. In foals, the mean RBC, WBC, PCV, haemoglobin concentration and MCHC values were higher, whereas MCV and MCH were lower than in older animals. Results indicating a significant decrease in WBC (P < 0.01) and an increase in MCV, MCH and MCHC (P < 0.05) with increasing age are consistent with some other reports on warm-blooded horses. The age-related variations in RBC and PCV were less marked. Contrary to some reports, RBC (P < 0.01), WBC and haemoglobin concentration (P < 0.001) were higher in Lipizzan stallions than in mares, but differences in MCHC, MCH and MCV were insignificant. The specific haematological values determined in Lipizzans are presumably a result of selection and should be taken into consideration when dealing with this race of horses.","['Age Factors', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Breeding', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Horses', 'Male', 'Reference Values', 'Sex Characteristics']",12069265,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.820.150', 'G05.090'], ['E01.370.225.625', 'E05.200.625'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.984.235.472'], ['E05.978.810'], ['G08.686.815']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

9407,Multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and associated risk factors in Oromia Region of Ethiopia.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) caused by multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Oromia Region, Ethiopia.METHODS: A 6-month case-control study was performed in 2013-14. Sputum samples and standardized questionnaire data (demographics, treatment, TB contact history, underlying disease, history of imprisonment) were collected from cases with suspected MDR-TB aged ? 18 years. Sputum was processed locally in the Oromia Public Health Laboratory using standard techniques. Data from MDR-TB cases and TB-positive controls were compared using logistic regression analysis. For each factor, the association with outcome variables was estimated by calculating the odds ratio (OR) together with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI).RESULTS: Of 439 suspected MDR-TB cases, 265 had a confirmed M. tuberculosis infection, of whom 88 (33%) had laboratory-confirmed MDR-TB. Over two-thirds (65%) were between 18 and 39 years of age. On multivariate analysis, an occupation of farming, known TB contact history, alcohol use, HIV infection, previous known TB history, and previous TB treatment outcome were predictors of MDR-TB.CONCLUSIONS: The rate of MDR-TB was high among suspected cases in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia. Local MDR-TB detection capacity and local epidemiology studies are essential to detect MDR-TB and guide the use of the sparse resources to optimize MDR-TB control. If TB is suspected, the presence of any of the above factors should alert Oromia Region clinicians and public health professionals to screen for MDR-TB.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Ethiopia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant', 'Young Adult']",26327121,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['G06.099.225.812', 'G06.225.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.300.500'], ['Z01.058.290.120.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['B03.510.024.962.500.702', 'B03.510.460.400.410.552.552.702'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846.775'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
12830,Systematic investigations of peak distortions due to additives in supercritical fluid chromatography.,"The impact of eluent components added to improve separation performance in supercritical fluid chromatography was systematically, and fundamentally, investigated. The model system comprised basic pharmaceuticals as solutes and eluents containing an amine (i.e., triethylamine, diethylamine, or isopropylamine) as additive with MeOH as the co-solvent. First, an analytical-scale study was performed, systematically investigating the impact of the additives/co-solvent on solute peak shapes and retentions, using a design of experiments approach; here, the total additive concentration in the eluent ranged between 0.021 and 0.105 % (v/v) and the MeOH fraction in the eluent between 16 and 26 % (v/v). The co-solvent fraction was found to be the most efficient tool for adjusting retentions, whereas the additive fraction was the prime tool for improving column efficiency and peak analytical performance. Next, the impacts of the amine additives on the shapes of the so-called overloaded solute elution profiles were investigated. Two principal types of preparative peak deformations appeared and were investigated in depth, analyzed using computer simulation with mechanistic modeling. The first type of deformation was due to the solute eluting too close to the additive perturbation peak, resulting in severe peak deformation caused by co-elution. The second type of deformation was also due to additive-solute interactions, but here the amine additives acted as kosmotropic agents, promoting the multilayer adsorption to the stationary phase of solutes with bulkier aryl groups.","['Adsorption', 'Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid', 'Computer Simulation', 'Diethylamines', 'Ethylamines', 'Propylamines', 'Solvents']",32204879,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['E05.196.181.750'], ['L01.224.160'], ['D02.092.471.302'], ['D02.092.471'], ['D02.092.831'], ['D27.720.844']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
14364,"Further study of hepatitis C virus RNA detection in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver tissues by ligation-dependent polymerase chain reaction.","Ligation-dependent polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) is a novel, simple and sensitive PCR assay that could be useful for the molecular diagnosis of various viral infections. This assay uses two capture probes for RNA isolation and two hemiprobes for the subsequent PCR. To investigate its usefulness in the field of pathological diagnosis, further study of this new PCR technology to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was carried out in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissues and the results compared with those obtained by the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method. We analyzed routinely processed FFPE liver specimens of surgical origin from 13 anti-HCV-seropositive Japanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As a result, HCV-RNA was detected in FFPE liver specimens in 12 of the tested patients (92.3%) by the LD-PCR method without the use of reverse transcription. In contrast, HCV-RNA was detectable in eight out of 13 cases (61.5%) by the RT-PCR method. These results indicated that LD-PCR was useful for HCV-RNA detection in routinely processed FFPE liver specimens.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'Formaldehyde', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral', 'Tissue Fixation']",9702854,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['D13.444.600.223', 'D27.505.259.750.600.223', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223'], ['D02.047.407'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.620'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.440.610', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.440.610', 'E05.200.500.620.760.440.610', 'E05.200.750.600.760.440.610'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.720', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.720', 'E05.200.500.620.760.720', 'E05.200.750.600.760.720']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
6681,Feeding state influences the content of FMRFamide- and tachykinin-related peptides in endocrine-like cells of the midgut of Locusta migratoria.,"The midgut of 5th instar male African migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, was found to contain endocrine-like cells that stained positively for FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity. These cells have cell bodies which are tear-drop in shape with processes extending from the cell body. FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity has been described in similar cells in adult midgut tissue [16]. The midgut tissue content of FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity is differentially distributed throughout various regions of the midgut (gastric cecae, anterior and posterior midgut) in 5th instar and varied ages of adult. FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity in midgut tissues decreases significantly by 24 h of starvation, whereas locustatachykinin I-like immunoreactivity does not decrease until 48 h of starvation indicating that there are differential timing effects of these two peptide families on midgut content. HPLC analysis, combined with RIA, of different regions of the midgut tissue from both fed and starved locusts revealed that the relative proportions of the members of the two peptide families vary depending upon the feeding state. These results indicate that the contents of these endocrine-like cells appears to be differentially influenced by the feeding state of the locust.","['Animals', 'Eating', 'Endocrine System', 'FMRFamide', 'Grasshoppers', 'Male', 'Tachykinins']",11179816,"[['B01.050'], ['G07.203.650.283', 'G10.261.330'], ['A06'], ['D12.644.400.235', 'D12.776.631.650.235'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.678.369'], ['D12.644.276.812.900', 'D12.644.400.800', 'D12.644.456.800', 'D12.776.467.812.900', 'D12.776.631.650.800', 'D23.469.050.375.850', 'D23.529.812.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41028,Reference point insensitive molecular data analysis.,"MOTIVATION: In biomedicine, every molecular measurement is relative to a reference point, like a fixed aliquot of RNA extracted from a tissue, a defined number of blood cells, or a defined volume of biofluid. Reference points are often chosen for practical reasons. For example, we might want to assess the metabolome of a diseased organ but can only measure metabolites in blood or urine. In this case, the observable data only indirectly reflects the disease state. The statistical implications of these discrepancies in reference points have not yet been discussed.RESULTS: Here, we show that reference point discrepancies compromise the performance of regression models like the LASSO. As an alternative, we suggest zero-sum regression for a reference point insensitive analysis. We show that zero-sum regression is superior to the LASSO in case of a poor choice of reference point both in simulations and in an application that integrates intestinal microbiome analysis with metabolomics. Moreover, we describe a novel coordinate descent based algorithm to fit zero-sum elastic nets.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R-package ""zeroSum"" can be downloaded at https://github.com/rehbergT/zeroSum Moreover, we provide all R-scripts and data used to produce the results of this manuscript as Supplementary Material CONTACT: Michael.Altenbuchinger@ukr.de, Thorsten.Rehberg@ukr.de and Rainer.Spang@ukr.deSupplementary information: Supplementary material is available at Bioinformatics online.","['Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Metabolomics', 'Software']",27634945,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['B03'], ['H01.158.273.180', 'L01.313.124'], ['L01.224.160'], ['G06.591.375', 'G16.500.275.157.049.100.500.375', 'N06.230.124.049.100.500.250'], ['G05.308.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H01.158.201.586', 'H01.158.273.180.599', 'H01.181.122.638'], ['L01.224.900']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

45520,"Segment-specific retention of a larval neuromuscular system and its role in a new, rhythmic, pupal motor pattern in Manduca sexta.","At pupation in Manduca sexta, accessory planta retractor muscles and their motoneurons degenerate in segment-specific patterns. Accessory planta retractor muscles in abdominal segments 2 and 3 survive in reduced form through the pupal stage and degenerate after adult emergence. Electromyographic and electrophysiological recordings show that these accessory planta retractor muscles participate in a new, rhythmic 'pupal motor pattern' in which all four muscles contract synchronously at approximately 4 s intervals for extended bouts. Accessory planta retractor muscle contractions are driven by synaptic activation of accessory planta retractor motoneurons and are often accompanied by rhythmic activity in intersegmental muscles and spiracular closer muscles. The pupal motor pattern is influenced by descending neural input although isolated abdominal ganglia can produce a pupal motor pattern-like rhythm. The robust pupal motor pattern first seen after pupal ecdysis weakens during the second half of pupal life. Anemometric recordings indicate that the intersegmental muscle and spiracular closer muscle component of the pupal motor pattern produces ventilation. Accessory planta retractor muscle contractions lift the flexible abdominal floor, to which the developing wings and legs adhere tightly. We hypothesize that, by a bellows-like action, the accessory planta retractor muscle contractions circulate hemolymph in the appendages. Morphometric analysis shows that dendritic regression is similar in accessory planta retractor motoneurons with different pupal fates, and that accessory planta retractor motoneurons begin to participate in the pupal motor pattern while their dendrites are regressed.","['Animals', 'Dendrites', 'Electromyography', 'Electrophysiology', 'Larva', 'Manduca', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscles', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Pupa']",9763701,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.675.256', 'A11.284.180.225', 'A11.671.240'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['B05.500.500', 'G07.345.500.550.500.500'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.937.650.525'], ['A08.675.655.500', 'A11.671.655.500'], ['G07.568', 'G11.427.410'], ['A02.633', 'A10.690'], ['C23.550.737'], ['B05.500.700', 'G07.345.500.550.500.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
133,Carbofuran-induced neurochemical and neurobehavioral alterations in rats: attenuation by N-acetylcysteine.,"Carbofuran, a widely used carbamate pesticide, has been reported to cause neurotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in carbofuran neurotoxicity are not well understood. The present study was envisaged to investigate the possible role of oxidative stress in carbofuran neurotoxicity and to evaluate the protective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Acetylcholinesterase activity was significantly inhibited in all the regions of brain after carbofuran exposure (1 mg/kg body weight, orally, for 28 days). NAC, on the other hand, was found to partially restore the activity of acetylcholinesterase in carbofuran treated animals. Carbofuran exposure resulted in increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) in brain regions accompanied by decreased levels of glutathione. NAC administration to the carbofuran exposed animals lowered LPO along with partial repletion in glutathione levels. Concomitantly, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were significantly decreased after carbofuran exposure, while no significant change in the activity of glutathione-S-transferase was observed. NAC treatment to carbofuran treated rats resulted in protective effect on the activities of these enzymes. Marked impairment in the motor function was seen following carbofuran exposure, which is evident by significant decrease in the retention time of the rats on rotating rods. Cognitive deficits were also seen after carbofuran exposure as indicated by the significant decrease in active avoidance response. NAC treatment significantly improved the carbofuran-induced neurobehavioral deficits. The results clearly demonstrate that carbofuran exerts its neurotoxic effects by accentuating oxidative stress and suggest neuroprotective role of NAC in carbofuran neurotoxicity.","['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcysteine', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Carbofuran', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Drug Interactions', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Glutathione', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Rotarod Performance Test']",16307259,"[['D08.811.277.352.100.170.176'], ['D02.886.030.230.259', 'D12.125.166.230.259'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['B01.050'], ['F02.463.425.097', 'F02.463.785.373.173'], ['F01.145.113'], ['A08.186.211'], ['G02.111.150', 'G03.185'], ['D02.241.081.251.583.166'], ['D27.505.519.389.275', 'D27.505.519.625.120.300', 'D27.505.696.577.120.300'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['D27.505.519.217.500'], ['D12.644.456.448'], ['G02.111.515', 'G03.295.531.587'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['E05.017.449']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
10726,Protein oxidation in emulsified cooked burger patties with added fruit extracts: Influence on colour and texture deterioration during chill storage.,"The influence of protein oxidation, as measured by the dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) method, on colour and texture changes during chill storage (2 degrees C, 12days) of cooked burger patties was studied. Extracts from arbutus-berries (Arbutus unedoL., AU), common hawthorns (Crataegus monogynaL., CM), dog roses (Rosa caninaL., RC) and elm-leaf blackberries (Rubus ulmifoliusSchott., RU) were prepared, added to burger patties (3% of total weight) and evaluated as inhibitors of protein oxidation and colour and texture changes. Negative (no added extract, C) and positive control (added quercetin; 230mg/kg, Q) groups were also considered. The significant increase of protein carbonyls during chill storage of control burger patties reflect the intense oxidative degradation of the muscle proteins. Concomitantly, an intense loss of redness and increase of hardness was found to take place in burger patties throughout refrigerated storage. Most fruit extracts as well as Q significantly reduced the formation of protein carbonyls and inhibited colour and texture deterioration during chill storage. Likely mechanisms through which protein oxidation could play a major role on colour and texture changes during chill storage of burger patties are discussed. Amongst the extracts, RC was most suitable for use as a functional ingredient in processed meats since it enhanced oxidative stability, colour and texture properties of burger patties with no apparent drawbacks.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cold Temperature', 'Color', 'Emulsions', 'Food Preservation', 'Food Technology', 'Fruit', 'Hydrazines', 'Meat', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plant Extracts', 'Protein Carbonylation', 'Refrigeration', 'Rosa']",20416800,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['G01.906.595.272', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.300', 'G16.500.750.775.710.300', 'N06.230.300.100.725.154', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.300'], ['G01.590.540.199'], ['D20.280.260', 'D26.255.165.260'], ['J01.576.423.850.700'], ['J01.576.423.850'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['D02.442'], ['G07.203.300.600', 'J02.500.600'], ['D12.776.210.500'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600.350', 'G02.111.691.600.350', 'G03.673.690', 'G03.734.871.790.600.350', 'G05.308.670.600.350', 'G07.775.750.750'], ['E02.792.643', 'E05.760.643'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
44362,Prenatal lead exposure enhances methamphetamine sensitization in rats.,"Adult female rats were exposed to lead-free sodium acetate via gavage [0 mg (vehicle control)] or to 16 mg lead as lead acetate for 30 days prior to breeding. Following confirmation of breeding, the female animals continued to be exposed to their respective doses throughout gestation and lactation. When weaned, 16 control and 16 lead-exposed offspring were placed on regular water and food (lead-exposure was discontinued) until postnatal day (PND) 70. At this time, one-half of the control animals and one-half of the lead-treatment animals received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of the vehicle (saline) for 10 successive days and the remaining animals in each exposure conditions received daily injections of 1.0 mg/kg (+)-methamphetamine (METH) for 10 days (N=8/group). Locomotion in automated chambers was monitored daily for 45 min post-injection. Subsequently, during dose-effect testing, all animals received consecutive daily i.p. injections of 0, 1.0, 2.0, and then 4.0 mg/kg METH. The results of the experiment showed that both control and lead-exposed animals exhibited heightened locomotor activity (i.e. behavioral sensitization) to the repeated administration of 1.0 mg/kg METH. More importantly, animals developmentally (perinatally) exposed to lead showed more rapid sensitization than did their control counterparts. These data indicate that early lead exposure increases sensitivity to the locomotor-stimulating effects of METH. In contrast, identically exposed lead animals exhibit diminished METH dose-effect responding when tested in an intravenous (i.v.) self-administration paradigm [Rocha A., Valles R., Bratton G.R., Nation J.R. Developmental lead exposure alters methamphetamine self-administration in the male rat: acquisition and reinstatement.

45348,"Metabolic syndrome correlates poorly with cognitive performance in stroke-free community-dwelling older adults: a population-based, cross-sectional study in rural Ecuador.","BACKGROUND: Studies investigating a possible correlation between metabolic syndrome and cognitive decline have been inconsistent.AIMS: To determine whether metabolic syndrome or each of its components correlate with cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults in rural Ecuador.METHODS: Stroke-free Atahualpa residents aged ?60 years were identified during a door-to-door survey. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Cognition was evaluated by the use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multivariate logistic regression models estimated the association between metabolic syndrome and each of its components with cognitive performance.RESULTS: A total of 212 persons (mean age: 69.2 ± 7.2 years, 64 % women) were enrolled. Of these, 120 (57 %) had metabolic syndrome. Mean scores in the MoCA were 18.2 ± 4.6 for persons with and 19 ± 4.7 for those without metabolic syndrome. In fully adjusted logistic models, MoCA scores were not associated with metabolic syndrome (p = 0.101). After testing individual components of metabolic syndrome with the MoCA score, we found that only hypertriglyceridemia was independently associated with the MoCA score (p = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study showed a poor correlation of metabolic syndrome with cognitive performance after adjusting for relevant confounders. Of the individual components of metabolic syndrome, only hypertriglyceridemia correlated with worse cognitive performance.","['Aged', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ecuador', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Independent Living', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Middle Aged', 'Rural Population', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Triglycerides']",26142624,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['F02.463.188'], ['F03.615.250.700'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['Z01.107.757.362'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I03.050.500', 'N01.224.791.550', 'N06.850.505.400.800.550'], ['C18.452.394.968.500.570', 'C18.452.625'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N01.600.725'], ['E05.318.740', 'H01.548.832', 'N05.715.360.750', 'N06.850.520.830'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['D10.351.801']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

1818,Effects of sodium hydroxide exposure on esophageal epithelial cells in an in vitro ovine model: implications for esophagus tissue engineering.,"BACKGROUND: Esophagus tissue engineering holds promises for esophageal replacement after severe caustic injuries. The aim of this study was to determine whether viable esophageal epithelial cells could be isolated from an esophagus exposed to varying concentrations of alkali with regard to number, viability, and morphology during in vitro culture.METHODS: Ovine esophagi were exposed to phosphate-buffered saline 2.5%, 15%, or 25% sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The effect of NaOH concentrations on epithelial damage was assessed histologically. Esophageal epithelial cells were then isolated, and cell count and viability were investigated. Finally, cell number, viability, and morphology of esophageal epithelial cells were determined for 24 days of in vitro culture.RESULTS: Histologic analysis showed a progressive destruction of the epithelium proportional to increasing NaOH concentrations. Esophagi treated with phosphate-buffered saline and 2.5% NaOH showed significantly higher viable cell counts after isolation and culture in comparison with those treated with 15% to 5% NaOH.CONCLUSION: The evidence presented in this study indicates that epithelial biopsies from an esophagus exposed to low concentrations (2.5%) of NaOH will still yield large numbers of viable cells suitable for tissue engineering applications. In cases of exposure to higher concentrations (15%-25%), alternative cell sources for epithelial regeneration, such as stem cells, will be necessary for tissue engineering applications.","['Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Caustics', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Esophagus', 'Sheep', 'Sodium Hydroxide', 'Tissue Engineering']",22595564,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['D27.720.185', 'D27.888.569.185'], ['E01.370.225.500.195', 'E05.200.500.195', 'E05.242.195', 'G04.140'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['A11.436'], ['A03.556.875.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['D01.045.250.750', 'D01.248.497.158.459.475', 'D01.857.745'], ['E05.481.500.311.500', 'J01.293.069.249.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

30608,A Community Study on the Relationship of Posttraumatic Cognitions to Internalizing and Externalizing Psychopathology in Taiwanese Children and Adolescents.,"A growing number of studies indicate that posttraumatic cognitions play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the effects of posttraumatic cognitions on general psychopathology beyond PTSD remain unclear. The current study aimed to validate the Chinese version of the Child Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (CPTCI-C) and to investigate the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and psychopathology. A community sample of 285 school-aged children and adolescents (aged 9-17, 160 [56.1 %] female) reported their trauma-related cognitions on the CPTCI-C and completed measures of symptoms of PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety. Parents reported their children's internalizing and externalizing problems. We validated a revised version of the CPTCI-C based on the results of confirmatory factor analyses. The resulting evidence suggests that this revised CPTCI-C possesses good internal consistency, fair 6-week temporal stability, and good concurrent validity. In addition to significant correlations between posttraumatic cognitions and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, after controlling for age, gender, and trauma types, both the revised CPTCI-C subscale scores conveyed unique contributions to psychological distress while only the maladaptive appraisals of the trauma remained weakly associated with externalizing problems. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that maladaptive appraisals of the trauma had a direct longitudinal impact on chronic PTSD severity. No mediation effect of posttraumatic cognitions on the relationship between acute and chronic PTSD activity was observed. The implications of our findings are discussed for the specificity of posttraumatic cognitions to posttraumatic internalizing psychopathology and cognitive interventions that target negative trauma-related cognitions.","['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Problem Behavior', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Psychological Trauma', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Taiwan']",25957269,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.145.022'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.145.179'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.126.972', 'F01.145.179.750'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['F03.950.750.375'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['F03.950.750.500'], ['Z01.252.474.872', 'Z01.639.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

36325,Genetic characterization of an elite coffee germplasm assessed by gSSR  and  EST-SSR markers.,"Coffee is one of the main agrifood commodities traded  worldwide. In 2009, coffee accounted for 6.1% of the value of Brazilian  agricultural production, generating a revenue of US$6 billion. Despite the  importance of coffee production in Brazil, it is supported by a narrow genetic  base, with few accessions. Molecular differentiation and diversity of a coffee  breeding program were assessed with gSSR and EST-SSR markers. The study  comprised 24 coffee accessions according to their genetic origin: arabica accessions  (six traditional genotypes of C. arabica), resistant arabica (six leaf  rust-resistant C. arabica genotypes with introgression of H?brido de  Timor), robusta (five C. canephora genotypes), H?brido de Timor (three C.  arabica x C. canephora), triploids (three C. arabica x C.  racemosa), and racemosa (one C. racemosa). Allele and polymorphism  analysis, AMOVA, the Student t-test, Jaccard's dissimilarity  coefficient, cluster analysis, correlation of genetic distances, and  discriminant analysis, were performed. EST-SSR markers gave 25 exclusive  alleles per genetic group, while gSSR showed 47, which will be useful for  differentiating accessions and for fingerprinting varieties. The gSSR markers  detected a higher percentage of polymorphism among (35% higher on average) and  within (42.9% higher on average) the genetic groups, compared to EST-SSR  markers. The highest percentage of polymorphism within the genetic groups was  found with gSSR markers for robusta (89.2%) and for resistant arabica (39.5%).  It was possible to differentiate all genotypes including the arabica-related  accessions. Nevertheless, combined use of gSSR and EST-SSR markers is  recommended for coffee molecular characterization, because EST-SSRs can provide  complementary information.","['Alleles', 'Coffea', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Ploidies', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",22002130,"[['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.456.937.275'], ['E05.318.740.225.500.500', 'E05.393.290', 'I01.198.780.937.375', 'N04.452.910.099.750'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['G05.380'], ['G05.700'], ['G05.365.795']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
9712,Piscine orthoreovirus subtype 3 (PRV-3) causes heart inflammation in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) mediated diseases have emerged throughout salmonid aquaculture. Three PRV subtypes are currently reported as causative agents of or in association with diseases in different salmonid species. PRV-1 causes heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and is associated with jaundice syndrome in farmed chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). PRV-2 causes erythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS) in coho salmon in Japan. PRV-3 has recently been associated with a disease in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) characterized by anaemia, heart and red muscle pathology; to jaundice syndrome in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In this study, we conducted a 10-week long experimental infection trial in rainbow trout with purified PRV-3 particles to assess the causal relationship between the virus and development of heart inflammation. The monitoring the PRV-3 load in heart and spleen by RT-qPCR shows a progressive increase of viral RNA to a peak, followed by clearance without a measurable change in haematocrit. The development of characteristic cardiac histopathological findings occurred in the late phase of the trial and was associated with increased expression of CD8+, indicating cytotoxic T cell proliferation. The findings indicate that, under these experimental conditions, PRV-3 infection in rainbow trout act similarly to PRV-1 infection in Atlantic salmon with regards to immunological responses and development of heart pathology, but not in the ability to establish a persistent infection.","['Animals', 'Fish Diseases', 'Heart Diseases', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Inflammation', 'Oncorhynchus mykiss', 'Orthoreovirus', 'Reoviridae Infections']",30777130,"[['B01.050'], ['C22.362'], ['C14.280'], ['G12.450.564'], ['C23.550.470'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.817.750.825.580.600'], ['B04.820.223.719.590'], ['C01.925.782.791']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1318,Academic health centers and care of undocumented immigrants in the United States: servant leaders or uncourageous followers?,"Public dialogue and debate about the health care overhaul in the United States is centered on one contentious question: Is there a moral obligation to ensure that all people (including undocumented immigrants) within its borders have access to affordable health care? For academic health centers (AHCs), which often provide safety-net care to the uninsured, this question has moral and social implications. An estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States (80% of whom are Latino) are uninsured and currently prohibited from purchasing exchange coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, even at full cost. The authors attempt to dispel the many misconceptions and distorted assumptions surrounding the use of health services by this vulnerable population. The authors also suggest that AHCs need to recalibrate their mission to focus on social accountability as well as the ethical and humanistic practice of medicine for all people, recognizing the significance of inclusion over exclusion in making progress on population health and health care. AHCs play a crucial role, both in educational policy and as a safety-net provider, in reducing health disparities that negatively impact vulnerable populations. Better health for all is possible through better alignment, collaboration, and partnering with other AHCs and safety-net providers. Through servant leadership, AHCs can be the leaders that this change imperative demands.","['Academic Medical Centers', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Emigrants and Immigrants', 'Female', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Leadership', 'Male', 'Medically Uninsured', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act', 'Social Responsibility', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations']",24556781,"[['N02.278.020'], ['N04.590.374', 'N05.300'], ['M01.189'], ['I01.655.500.608.400.285', 'I01.880.604.825.608.400.285', 'N03.349.285', 'N03.623.500.608.428.285', 'N04.590.374.285', 'N05.300.380'], ['N03.349.380.420', 'N05.300.450'], ['N04.590.374.380', 'N05.300.493'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.609'], ['M01.385'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['N03.219.521.576.343.918', 'N03.706.615.806'], ['F01.829.500.760', 'K01.752.566.869'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['M01.965']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
3822,IL-6 increases muscle insulin sensitivity only at superphysiological levels.,"Exercise induces an increase in glucose transport in muscle. As the acute increase in glucose transport reverses, it is replaced by an increase in insulin sensitivity. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases with exercise and has been reported to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Based on this information, we hypothesized that IL-6 would result in an increase in muscle insulin sensitivity. Rat epitrochlearis and soleus muscles were incubated with 120 ng/ml IL-6. Exposure to IL-6 induced a modest acute increase in glucose transport and was followed 3.5 h later by an increase in insulin sensitivity in epitrochlearis but not soleus muscles. IL-6 also brought about an increase in AMPK phosphorylation in epitrochlearis muscles. We conclude that exposure of fast-twitch muscle to 120 ng/ml IL-6 increases insulin sensitivity by activating AMPK. However, exposure of epitrochlearis muscles to 10 ng/ml IL-6, a concentration >100-fold higher than that attained in plasma during exercise, had no effect on glucose transport or insulin sensitivity. These findings provide evidence that the increases in glucose transport and insulin sensitivity induced by IL-6 are pharmacological rather than physiological effects. We interpret our results as evidence that the increase in IL-6 during exercise does not play a role in the exercise-induced increases in muscle glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity.","['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Forelimb', 'Glucose', 'Hindlimb', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Male', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Time Factors']",17327367,"[['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.085', 'D12.644.360.062', 'D12.776.476.062'], ['B01.050'], ['G03.143'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['A13.395'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['A13.473'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.224', 'D12.776.467.374.465.202', 'D23.529.374.465.224'], ['D05.500.562', 'D08.811.600'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
26290,Pilot electromyographic studies of resting oral activity in obese and normal subjects.,"Subjects were placed alone in a room where purposeful oral activity such as eating, talking and smoking was not permitted, while activity such as pursing the lips sucking on cheeks, grimaces etc was measured by a specially designed electromyometer. This was done via electrodes attached to the peri-oral area and was recorded in a standardized fashion. In contrast to expectations, total resting activity in the obese did not differ significantly from that of normals. However, the two groups differ in that the time lapse prior to major peaking is significantly shorter in normals than in the obese. Analysis of patterns of both obese and normals suggests cyclic activity of approximately 120 min duration, and this was confirmed with a small group of ten obese subjects. The implications of these findings, in terms of previous work on oral cycles in the obese as well as implications for future research, are discussed.","['Adult', 'Cues', 'Electromyography', 'Facial Muscles', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth', 'Obesity', 'Periodicity', 'Reading', 'Stress, Psychological']",528132,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24713,Minimizing 18O/16O back-exchange in the relative quantification of ribonucleic acids.,"The use of isotopically labeled endonuclease digestion products allows for the relative quantification of ribonucleic acids (RNAs). This approach utilizes ribonucleases such as RNase T1 to mediate the incorporation of 18O onto the 3'-terminus of the endonuclease digestion product from a solution containing heavy water (H2 18O). The accuracy and precision of relative quantification are dependent on the efficiency of isotope incorporation and minimizing any possible 18O to 16O back-exchange before or during mass spectral analysis. Here, we have investigated the stability of 18O-labeled endonuclease digestion products to back-exchange. In particular, the effects of pH, temperature and presence of RNase on the back-exchange process were examined using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). We have found that back-exchange depends on the presence of the RNase--back-exchange was not observed once the enzyme was removed from the sample. With RNase present, at all pH values examined (from acidic to basic pH), back-exchange was detected at incubation above room temperature. The rates and extent of back-exchange were similar at all pH values. In contrast, back-exchange in the presence of RNase was found to be especially sensitive to incubation temperature--at temperatures below room temperature, minimal back-exchange was detected. However, back-exchange increased as the incubation temperature increased. Based on these findings, appropriate sample-handling and sample storage conditions for isotopically labeled endonuclease digestion products have been identified, and these conditions should improve the accuracy and precision of results from the relative quantification of RNAs obtained by this approach.","['Biocatalysis', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolases', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Oligoribonucleotides', 'Oxygen Isotopes', 'RNA, Bacterial', 'RNA, Transfer, Glu', 'Ribonuclease T1', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Water']",19484804,"[['G02.111.086', 'G02.130.500', 'G03.105'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G02.300'], ['D08.811.277'], ['E05.522'], ['D13.695.578.424.500'], ['D01.268.185.550.500', 'D01.362.670.300', 'D01.496.625'], ['D13.444.735.473'], ['D13.444.735.757.700.410'], ['D08.811.277.352.355.350.725', 'D08.811.277.352.700.350.725'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
5686,Pituitary and adrenal control of pancreatic endocrine function in the duck.,"Recent clinical and immunological data suggest that the classical concept of ""idiopathic autoimmune diseases"" is to be revised. In a normal population, autoimmunity reactions against thyroid gland, gastric mucosa and adrenals develop slowly with increasing age and are found more frequently in women than in men (at least so far as thyroid antibodies are concerned) as is lowering of the functional activity of T lymphocytes. Diabetes takes its place among a series of factors diminishing immunocyte reactivity, and thus enhancing the development of the autoimmunity process. This may perhaps be promoted in some way by genetic factors, perhaps those which also play a definite though as yet ill-defined role in determining the emergence of diabetes. For the present, diabetes mellitus itself must only rarely be considered a consequence of an autoimmune process and then only in certain insulin-dependent cases. By contrast, diabetes appears frequently to be an activator of autoimmune phenomena against tissues other than pancreas, namely thyroid gland, adrenals and gastric mucosa. Awareness of these associations should encourage physicians to seek latent humoral or cellular evidence of autoimmune phenomena in diabetics; this would favour the early recognition of clinically important abnormalities which may accompany the diabetes.","['Animals', 'Blood Glucose', 'Corticosterone', 'Ducks', 'Fasting', 'Glucagon', 'Glucose', 'Growth Hormone', 'Hypophysectomy', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System']",789141,"[['B01.050'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.237', 'D06.472.040.585.353.237'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.050.200', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.345'], ['F01.145.407.400', 'G07.203.650.240.587', 'G07.203.650.353.400'], ['D06.472.699.587.730.500', 'D12.644.548.586.730.500'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D06.472.699.631.525.425', 'D12.644.548.691.525.425'], ['E04.270.532', 'E04.525.400'], ['A03.734.414', 'A06.300.414'], ['A06.300.747', 'A06.688.357.750', 'A08.186.211.180.497.352.435.500', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.352.435.500', 'A08.713.357.750'], ['A06.300.747.500', 'A06.688.357.750.500', 'A08.186.211.180.497.352.435.500.500', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.352.435.500.500', 'A08.713.357.750.500'], ['A06.300.691']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24206,mDia-interacting protein acts downstream of Rho-mDia and modifies Src activation and stress fiber formation.,"The formin homology protein mDia is a Rho GTPase effector protein that participates in stress fiber formation, cytokinesis, and transcriptional activation of the serum response factor. Although the function of another effector of Rho, Rho-associated kinase, is well established, relatively little is known about the functional mechanism and the downstream targets of mDia. Our recent report of a Rho-mDia-Src-tyrosine kinase pathway suggested an important role for mDia in cell adhesion turnover. We identified a new mDia-interacting protein which is expressed ubiquitously. The new protein mainly binds to the proline-rich region of mDia through its Src homology 3 domain and also binds to Grb2 through its proline-rich domain. The protein is localized at the cell periphery and membrane ruffles and co-localizes with mDia. Co-expression of vSrc and the mDia-interacting protein induces significant morphological changes at focal contacts and activation of vSrc. Furthermore, we found that the mDia-interacting protein plays an important role in stress fiber formation induced by active mDia1. Our results suggest that this new protein regulates actin polymerization and cell adhesion turnover in the downstream portion of the Rho-mDia pathway by interacting with Grb2 and Src.","['3T3 Cells', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Formins', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proline', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Stress Fibers', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'src-Family Kinases']",11509578,"[['A11.251.210.100', 'A11.329.228.100'], ['D12.644.360.024', 'D12.776.157.057', 'D12.776.476.024'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210.172.500', 'A11.329.228.220'], ['D12.776.157'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['D05.750.078.730.333', 'D12.776.220.525.333'], ['D12.644.360.024.290', 'D12.776.157.057.041', 'D12.776.476.024.377'], ['D08.811.913.225.500'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.320', 'E05.601.470.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.360.600'], ['E01.370.225.812.735.645', 'E05.196.150.639.500', 'E05.200.812.735.645', 'E05.478.594.760.645', 'E05.478.605.492'], ['D12.125.072.401.623'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.776'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750.050.830'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['E05.393.220.870', 'E05.601.690.650', 'E05.601.870'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.800']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
7459,Self-paced saccades and saccades to oddball targets in Parkinson's disease.,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) manifest difficulty in initiation and execution of movements, particularly when movements are sequential, simultaneous or repetitive. Eye movements are particularly effective in evaluating motor impairments. We utilized a series of saccadic eye movement paradigms to explore the ability of 13 patients with mild-moderate PD and 13 age-matched healthy controls to self-pace saccades between two continuously illuminated targets, before and after an externally cued tracking period, and respond to unexpected changes in task demand. The latter was explored by measuring saccadic responses to unexpected ""oddball"" targets that appeared during a well-learned reciprocating sequence of saccades, in either the opposite direction to that expected or at twice the anticipated extent. Results indicated that all participants demonstrated a marked increase in saccade amplitudes from the externally cued saccade tracking to the self-paced saccades. Unexpectedly, this difference was magnified in PD patients. Self-paced saccades before externally cueing were also more frequent than requested in the PD group, but timing improved following external cueing. The second key finding was that while patients were able to respond to unexpected changes in target amplitude, performance was more variable (in terms of latency and accuracy) when responding to unexpected changes in target direction. Hence, beneficial effects of external cueing on the timing of self-paced saccades may be mediated through cortical regions, placing less emphasis on striatal regions known to be compromised in PD. Additionally, responding to changes in saccade direction (but not amplitude) may rely on basal ganglia circuitry.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Cues', 'Female', 'Fixation, Ocular', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neural Pathways', 'Ocular Motility Disorders', 'Orientation', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Reaction Time', 'Saccades']",16822490,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249'], ['F02.463.425.234'], ['G14.350.253'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A08.612'], ['C10.228.758', 'C10.292.562', 'C11.590'], ['F01.058.577', 'F02.830.606'], ['C10.228.140.079.862.500', 'C10.228.662.600.400', 'C10.574.928.750'], ['E05.723.729'], ['F02.808', 'G11.427.700', 'G11.561.660'], ['E05.796.817', 'F02.830.650', 'F04.669.817', 'G11.561.677'], ['G14.350.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
44174,Effects of specific fatty acid acylation of phospholipase A2 on its interfacial binding and catalysis.,"Monomeric phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from the venom of Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus (App-D49) was treated with 3-acyloxy-4-nitrobenzoic acids to acylate the epsilon-amino groups of two lysines (Lys-7 and Lys-10) in the amino terminal region. Resulting 7,10-diacylated-App-D49s, with acyl groups ranging from lauroyl to palmitoyl, spontaneously aggregated in solution. By contrast, 7,10-dioctanoyl-App-D49 existed as a monomer under the same condition. Kinetic and interfacial binding properties of diacylated enzymes indicated that they catalyzed the hydrolysis at the interface as a monomer. When compared to nonacylated App-D49, diacylated enzymes showed slightly increased activity or decreased activity toward monodispersed 1,2-dibutyryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, Triton X-100/1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine mixed micelles, and small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC). Toward densely-packed liquid-crystalline phospholipid bilayers, such as large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of POPC, however, diacylated enzymes exhibited a large increase in activity, which reacted up to 250-fold for 7,10-dilauroyl-App-D49 ((kcat/Km)app = (1.0 +/- 0.02) x 10(6) M-1 s-1). Measurements of the penetration of individual diacylated enzymes into 2-oleoyl-3-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphocholine (i.e., D-POPC) monolayers indicated that the acyl groups enhanced the interfacial binding of protein by interacting with hydrocarbon moieties of phospholipids and that these hydrophobic interactions remained effective even when the phospholipid packing density was high. Furthermore, fluorometric measurements of the binding of diacylated enzymes to polymerized vesicles of 1,2-bis[12-(lipoyloxy)dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine showed that the hydrophobic interactions increased the enzymatic activity toward LUV by accelerating the migration of enzyme molecules to vesicle surfaces. The analysis of the kinetic course of POPC LUV hydrolysis showed that diacylated enzymes as a catalyst were superior to nonacylated App-D49 in that they were not only more catalytically efficient but also able to catalyze more turnovers without being trapped in product-containing vesicles. In summary, the acylation of App-D49 by 3-acyloxy-4-nitrobenzoic acids provides a simple and convenient way of converting the enzyme into a highly active form toward densely-packed liquid-crystalline phospholipid bilayers, which might have potential industrial and biomedical applications.","['Acylation', 'Agkistrodon', 'Animals', 'Catalysis', 'Crotalid Venoms', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fatty Acids', 'Liposomes', 'Phospholipases A', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Surface Properties', 'Thermodynamics']",7918373,"[['G02.111.012', 'G02.607.063', 'G03.040'], ['B01.050.150.900.833.672.125.937.240.250'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.130'], ['D20.888.850.960.200', 'D23.946.833.850.960.200'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D10.251'], ['D25.479.517', 'D26.255.260.517', 'J01.637.051.479.517', 'J01.637.087.500.517'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.680.750'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.680.750.937'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600', 'G02.111.691.600', 'G03.734.871.790.600', 'G05.308.670.600'], ['G02.111.835'], ['G02.860'], ['G01.906']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Analogues of GM3 and GM2 ganglioside saccharidic portions where the acetyl group of NeuNAc has been replaced by a phenylacetyl (PhAc) or a propanoyl (Prop) moiety have been efficiently prepared with metabolically engineered E. coli bacteria. GM3 analogues were either obtained by chemoselective modification of biosynthetic N-acetyl-sialyllactoside (GM3 NAc) or by direct bacterial synthesis using C5-modified neuraminic acid precursors. The latter strategy proved to be very versatile as it led to an efficient synthesis of GM2 analogues. These glycomimetics were assessed against hemagglutinins and sialidases. In particular, the GM3 NPhAc displayed a binding affinity for Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) similar to that of GM3 NAc, while being resistant to hydrolysis by Vibrio cholerae (VC) neuraminidase. A preliminary study with influenza viruses also confirmed a selective inhibition of N1 neuraminidase by GM3 NPhAc, suggesting potential developments for the detection of flu viruses and for fighting them.","['Agglutinins', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hemagglutinins', 'Hydrolysis', 'Maackia', 'Metabolic Engineering', 'Neuraminic Acids', 'Neuraminidase', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Sialic Acids', 'Vibrio cholerae']",26088695,"[['D27.505.696.477.136', 'D27.505.954.502.270.232'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D27.505.696.477.136.377'], ['G02.380'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.401.581'], ['E05.393.420.526', 'E05.481.500.311.249', 'J01.293.069.249.249'], ['D02.241.081.844.562', 'D02.241.511.902.562', 'D09.067.687', 'D09.811.589'], ['D08.811.277.450.692'], ['D09.698.629'], ['D02.241.081.844.562.668', 'D02.241.511.902.562.668', 'D09.067.687.668', 'D09.811.589.668'], ['B03.440.450.900.859.225', 'B03.660.250.830.830.100']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
39158,Genetic basis of antimicrobial drug resistance in clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Hadar from a Spanish region.,"The genetic bases of antimicrobial drug resistance (R) of 79 Salmonella enterica serotype Hadar clinical isolates (recovered during 1995-2001 in a Spanish region) was investigated. The isolates showed a limited genomic variation, as demonstrated by PFGE analysis using XbaI (three profiles, S>or=0.77) and BlnI (seven profiles, S>or=0.49; with 95% of the isolates falling into two clusters, S>or=0.75). Thirteen R-profiles, ranging from susceptible to multidrug resistant, were recognized. All susceptible isolates (14%) were recovered before or during 1998, when multidrug resistance (MDR) was still uncommon (20% from 1995-1998). In later years, the percentage of MDR increased considerably (92% in 2001). Resistance to nalidixic acid, tetracycline, streptomycin and ampicillin-cefalotin, encoded by gyrA-Asp87/Asn, tet(A), strA/B, and bla (TEM) genes, respectively, were the most common, appearing together in 38% of the isolates. In all tetracycline- and streptomycin-resistant isolates, strA/B and tet(A) were chromosomally located, whereas bla (TEM) was plasmid-born. Five different bla (TEM) plasmids (pUO-ShR1 to pUO-ShR5, of about 9.4, 23, 30, 45, and 95 kb, respectively) were identified. pUO-ShR3 and pUO-ShR5 harbored additional R-genes: [dfrA1] and [acc(3)IV-strA/B], respectively. pUO-Sh2, pUO-Sh3, pUO-ShR4, and pUO-Sh5 were self-transferable, and the latter could also mobilize pUOShR1. The reported data constitute a useful background for further epidemiological studies of MDR in S. Hadar.","['Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Integrons', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Plasmids', 'Salmonella enterica']",15910235,"[['G06.099.225.812', 'G06.225.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.300.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.330.200.500'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['G05.360.600'], ['B03.440.450.425.800.200', 'B03.660.250.150.710.160']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9619,Influence of proximal side mutations on the molecular and electronic structure of cyanomet myoglobin: an 1H NMR study.,"A series of proximal side mutants of sperm whale metmyoglobin (metMb) that involves residues which provide hydrogen bonds to the axial His and heme have been prepared, and the CO binding and solution molecular and electronic structure has been investigated by 1H NMR. These include Ser92(F7), whose O gamma serves as a hydrogen-bond acceptor to the axial His ring NdeltaH and whose O gamma H serves as hydrogen-bond donor to the 7-propionate carboxylate, and His97(FG3) whose ring provides the other hydrogen-bond donor to the 7-propionate carboxylate. 2D NMR data on the S92A-metMbCN, S92P-metMbCN and H97F-metMbCN show that the distal structure is completely conserved and that proximal side structural changes are highly localized. For the S92A-metMbCN, altered dipolar contacts to the F-helix backbone show that the axial His imidazole has rotated clockwise by approximately 10 degrees relative to a stationary heme, while in H97F-metMbCN, the altered heme-E helix backbone contacts reveal that the heme has rotated counterclockwise by approximately 3 degrees relative to a conserved axial His. The pattern of axial His rotation was qualitatively predicted by energy minimization calculations. The assignments and conserved structural elements allow the determination of a set of magnetic axes whose major magnetic axis is unchanged with respect to WT and confirms that local distal, and not proximal, interactions control the orientation of the major magnetic axis and, by inference, the degree and direction of tilt of the Fe-CN from the heme normal. The rhombic magnetic axes in S92A-metMbCN are rotated approximately 10 degrees in the opposite direction from the established approximately 10 degrees rotation for the axial His ring as expected. It is shown, moreover, that the pairwise alpha-, gamma-meso vs beta-, delta-meso-H hyperfine shift differences are well predicted by the change in the location of the rhombic magnetic axes. Carbon monoxide ligation rates experience minor but systematic perturbation for the S92A substitutions which confirms an influence (albeit very small) for axial His orientation on ligand affinity.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Energy Transfer', 'Heme', 'Histidine', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Metmyoglobin', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protons', 'Spermatozoa', 'Whales']",9578585,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['D01.200.250', 'D01.362.200', 'D01.650.550.250'], ['G01.154.240', 'G02.111.255', 'G02.216'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.500.640.587', 'D03.633.400.909.500.640.587', 'D04.345.783.500.640.587', 'D23.767.727.640.587'], ['D12.125.072.329', 'D12.125.142.308'], ['G02.300'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['D12.776.422.316.940.500'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['E05.196.867.519.550'], ['D01.248.497.300.459.700', 'D01.268.406.750', 'D01.362.340.750', 'G01.249.660.500'], ['A05.360.490.890', 'A11.497.760'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.875.865']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2982,Prediction of recurrent venous thrombosis in all patients with a first venous thrombotic event: The Leiden Thrombosis Recurrence Risk Prediction model (L-TRRiP).,"BACKGROUND: Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common. Current guidelines suggest that patients with unprovoked VTE should continue anticoagulants unless they have a high bleeding risk, whereas all others can stop. Prediction models may refine this dichotomous distinction, but existing models apply only to patients with unprovoked first thrombosis. We aimed to develop a prediction model for all patients with first VTE, either provoked or unprovoked.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were used from two population-based cohorts of patients with first VTE from the Netherlands (Multiple Environment and Genetic Assessment of Risk Factors for Venous Thrombosis [MEGA] follow-up study, performed from 1994 to 2009; model derivation; n = 3,750) and from Norway (Troms? study, performed from 1999 to 2016; model validation; n = 663). Four versions of a VTE prediction model were developed: model A (clinical, laboratory, and genetic variables), model B (clinical variables and fewer laboratory markers), model C (clinical and genetic factors), and model D (clinical variables only). The outcome measure was recurrent VTE. To determine the discriminatory power, Harrell's C-statistic was calculated. A prognostic score was assessed for each patient. Kaplan-Meier plots for the observed recurrence risks were created in quintiles of the prognostic scores. For each patient, the 2-year predicted recurrence risk was calculated. Models C and D were validated in the Troms? study. During 19,201 person-years of follow-up (median duration 5.7 years) in the MEGA study, 507 recurrences occurred. Model A had the highest predictive capability, with a C-statistic of 0.73 (95% CI 0.71-0.76). The discriminative performance was somewhat lower in the other models, with C-statistics of 0.72 for model B, 0.70 for model C, and 0.69 for model D. Internal validation showed a minimal degree of optimism bias. Models C and D were externally validated, with C-statistics of 0.64 (95% CI 0.62-0.66) and 0.65 (95% CI 0.63-0.66), respectively. According to model C, in 2,592 patients with provoked first events, 367 (15%) patients had a predicted 2-year risk of >10%, whereas in 1,082 patients whose first event was unprovoked, 484 (45%) had a predicted 2-year risk of <10%. A limitation of both cohorts is that laboratory measurements were missing in a substantial proportion of patients, which therefore were imputed.CONCLUSIONS: The prediction model we propose applies to patients with provoked or unprovoked first VTE-except for patients with (a history of) cancer-allows refined risk stratification, and is easily usable. For optimal individualized treatment, a management study in which bleeding risks are also taken into account is necessary.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulants', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Norway', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Venous Thrombosis', 'Young Adult']",31603898,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['D27.505.954.502.119'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C23.550.414'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['Z01.542.816.374'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E01.789'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C14.907.355.830.925'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
37723,COSTS OF DEPRESSION FROM CLAIMS DATA FOR MEDICARE RECIPIENTS IN A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE.,"BACKGROUND: Many persons with depressive disorder are not treated and associated costs are not recorded.AIMS OF THE STUDY: To determine whether major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with higher medical cost among Medicare recipients.METHODS: Four waves of the Baltimore-Epidemiologic Catchment Area (Baltimore ECA) Study conducted between 1981 and 2004 were linked to Medicare claims data for the years 1999 to 2004 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Generalized linear models specified with a gamma distribution and log link function were used to examine direct medical care costs associated with MDD.RESULTS: Medicare recipients with no history of MDD in either the ECA or CMS data had mean six-year medical costs of US $40,670, compared to $87,445 for Medicare recipients with MDD as recorded in CMS data and $43,583 for those with MDD as recorded in Baltimore-ECA data. Multivariable regressions found that compared to Medicare recipients with no history of depression, those with depression identified in the CMS data had significantly higher medical costs; about 1.87 times (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 2.67) higher. Medicare recipients with a history of depression identified in the ECA data were no more likely to have higher costs than were Medicare recipients with no history of depression (relative ratio 1.33, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.02).DISCUSSION: Medicare recipients with a history of depression identified in claims data had significantly higher medical costs than recipients with no history of depression. However, no significant differences were found between Medicare recipients with depression in the community-based Baltimore ECA data and those with no history of depression. The results show that the source of diagnosis, in treatment versus survey data, produces differences in results as regards costs.LIMITATIONS: This study involved only Medicare recipients with claims data over the six years 1999 to 2004. Many of the ECA respondents were too young to qualify for Medicare.IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY: Depressive disorder involves substantial medical care costs. The findings provide information on the economic burden of depression, an important but often omitted dimension and perspective of the burden of mental illnesses.","['Aged', 'Baltimore', 'Catchment Area, Health', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'United States']",27483975,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['Z01.107.567.875.500.500.100', 'Z01.433.100'], ['N01.224.791.200', 'N03.349.650.095', 'N06.850.505.400.800.200'], ['F03.600.300.375'], ['N03.219.151.400', 'N05.300.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N03.219.521.576.215'], ['N03.219.521.346.506.564.663', 'N03.219.521.576.343.840', 'N03.706.615.696'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

16965,Hepatocellular carcinoma complicating autoimmune hepatitis: role of hepatitis C virus.,"The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in autoimmune hepatitis is low, even in patients with long-standing cirrhosis. Because of the increasing recognition of an association of hepatitis C virus (HCV) with autoimmune hepatitis, at least in some geographical areas, and with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (hepatoma), we have examined eight cases (4 male, 4 female) who presented between 1985 and 1993 with hepatoma complicating autoimmune hepatitis. All had steroid-responsive autoimmune hepatitis with serum anti-smooth muscle and anti-nuclear autoantibodies. Median duration of disease was 17.1 years, and all patients had biopsy-proven cirrhosis. One patient had a history of intravenous drug abuse, and four had previously received blood transfusions. Serum samples (stored at -20 degrees C from up to 9 years before diagnosis of hepatoma) were tested for anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies by a second-third-generation assay and for HCV RNA by the polymerase chain reaction method using primers from the 5'noncoding region. Tissue from liver adjacent to tumor areas was subjected to polymerase chain reaction along with tissue from previous liver biopsy specimens (taken up to 19 years before diagnosis of hepatoma) in all patients. Six patients had evidence of HCV infection: four seropositive for HCV RNA (two of whom were also anti-HCV positive) and two seronegative for HCV RNA and anti-HCV but with HCV RNA in liver tissue at presentation with hepatoma. Retrospective testing showed probable acquisition of HCV through blood transfusion in the four transfused patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis Antibodies', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Probes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Viral']",7657274,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C20.111'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['A12.207.152', 'A15.145'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['C06.552.380'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254.450', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254.450', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.620'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D27.505.259.750', 'D27.720.470.530'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D13.444.735.828']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
46778,A model for computer simulation of P-glycoprotein and transmembrane delta pH-mediated anthracycline transport in multidrug-resistant tumor cells.,"Anthracycline resistance in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells is due in part to a reduced cellular drug accumulation. Using a simple kinetic model and numerical computer simulations, we have analyzed mathematically the following possible mechanisms controlling fluxes of the membrane permeable anthracyclines in MDR cells: (1) active outward transport via a specific drug transporter (P-glycoprotein), (2) exocytotic drug export via the endosomal vesicle system, and (3) pH-gradients across the plasma membrane. Model calculations were based on morphometric and kinetic data previously presented in the literature for daunorubicin transport in wild-type Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (EHR2) and the corresponding daunorubicin (DNR)-resistant cell line EHR2/DNR+. The results confirm the possible importance of the cell-surface pH in controlling DNR accumulation in the cells. With P-glycoprotein as the main efflux pump, a catalytic constant of the protein greater than 40 mol DNR transported/mol protein per min is predicted by the model calculations. Changes in the drug binding affinity of P-glycoprotein (Km = 10(-9)-10(-6) M) is of little importance in influencing its effectiveness to reduce DNR accumulation, which could explain the broad substrate specificity of the MDR efflux pump system. The conditions to evaluate unidirectional fluxes of DNR across the plasma membrane in cells with active P-glycoprotein are defined. An efflux mechanism which relies solely on pH-dependent drug trapping in a pH 5 endosomal compartment by a simple diffusion process followed by exocytosis, appears inadequate to account for the high rate of DNR efflux in EHR2/DNR+ cells.","['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Biological Transport', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane', 'Computer Simulation', 'Daunorubicin', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins']",2242381,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248.106'], ['G03.143'], ['C04.557.470.200.200', 'C04.619.169'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A11.284.149'], ['L01.224.160'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200', 'D04.615.562.050.200', 'D09.408.051.059.200'], ['G07.690.773.984'], ['G02.300'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['H01.548'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['D12.776.624']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
3288,Cytoskeleton of human mononuclear cells as a possible peripheral marker for phenylalanine neurotoxicity in PKU.,"In this work we tested human mononuclear cells as a peripheral marker to study neurotoxicity of phenylalanine (Phe). Slices of cerebral cortex of rats or human mononuclear cells were incubated with different concentrations of Phe and/or Ala in the presence of 32P-orthophosphate, the cytoskeletal fraction was extracted, and the radioactivity incorporated into intermediate filament proteins was measured. Our results show that 2 mM Phe as well as 1 mM Ala are effective in increasing the 32P in vitro incorporation into IFs in both tissues. When cerebral cortex slices or mononuclear cells were incubated with different concentrations of Phe and/or Ala, the effects on the 32P in vitro incorporation into IF proteins was compatible with an antagonistic mechanism of action of the two amino acids on the enzymes of the phosphorylating system. In addition, these blood cells may be a possible peripheral marker to study neurotoxicity of Phe in patients with PKU.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Monocytes', 'Phenylalanine', 'Phenylketonurias', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",12515306,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.101'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['A11.118.637.555.652', 'A11.148.580', 'A11.627.624', 'A11.733.547', 'A15.145.229.637.555.652', 'A15.378.316.580', 'A15.382.490.555.652', 'A15.382.670.547', 'A15.382.680.547'], ['D12.125.072.050.685', 'D12.125.142.666'], ['C10.228.140.163.100.687', 'C16.320.565.100.766', 'C16.320.565.189.687', 'C18.452.132.100.687', 'C18.452.648.100.766', 'C18.452.648.189.687'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
46073,Assessing risk of falling in older adults.,"Falls by older people present serious problems in every society. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of a checklist in estimation and reduction of the risk for falls for older adults in Taiwan. Following literature review, a purposive sample was used in a cross-sectional design to assess risk factors using a checklist. Older adults (N = 103) were recruited from three sheltered housing projects (elderly apartments in Taipei County); 52 individuals had fallen within the past year.

11129,Organization and evolution of a gene cluster for human immunoglobulin variable regions of the kappa type.,"An 80,000 base-pair region from the gene locus encoding the variable regions of the human immunoglobulins of the kappa type (V kappa genes) was cloned and analysed. The region comprises five V kappa sequences of subgroup I and one interspersed V kappa pseudogene of subgroup II. The six genes and pseudogenes are arranged at different distances but in the same orientation. The organization of the cluster can be explained by a series of amplification steps; the existence of a V kappa II pseudogene in a V kappa I gene cluster may have been the result of a transposition event; a final duplication step led to a second closely related copy of the cluster. From sequence data for altogether 16,000 base-pairs it appears that gene conversion-like events and subsequent selection contribute to both homogeneity and diversity of the V kappa repertoire.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibody Diversity', 'Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains']",6086934,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G05.365.036', 'G12.500.199'], ['G02.111.080'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.045', 'G16.075'], ['E05.393.183'], ['D08.811.150.280', 'D08.811.277.352.335.350.300', 'D08.811.277.352.355.325.300'], ['G05.308.250', 'G05.365.590.310', 'G05.558.315'], ['G05.360.340.024.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.705.750', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.750', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.750'], ['D12.644.541.500.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.797', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.790.651.797', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650.500', 'D12.776.377.715.548.797', 'G02.111.570.060.425'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.705.750.530', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.750.530', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.750.530']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

11270,United States Travelers' Concern about Zika Infection and Willingness to Receive a Hypothetical Zika Vaccine.,"The ongoing Zika pandemic has affected many countries that are common travel destinations. We assessed the willingness to receive a prophylactic Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccine, currently under development, among travelers to areas with reported autochthonous ZIKV transmission. We surveyed United States (U.S.) residents aged 18-44 years who had ever heard of ZIKV and planned to travel to Florida and/or Texas (N = 420) or a U.S. territory or foreign country (N = 415) in 2017, using a nationally representative internet panel. Travelers to Florida and/or Texas reported less concern about ZIKV infection than travelers to other destinations (27% versus 36%, P = 0.01). Female sex, Hispanic ethnicity, discussing ZIKV with medical professionals, ZIKV risk perception, and self-efficacy for ZIKV prevention predicted concern about ZIKV infection in both groups. Travelers to Florida and/or Texas (43%) and other destinations (44%) were equally willing to receive a ZIKV vaccine. Hispanic ethnicity, discussing ZIKV with medical professionals, and concern about ZIKV infection predicted vaccine willingness in both groups. Likelihood of using existing ZIKV prevention methods, confidence in the U.S. government to prevent ZIKV spread, self-efficacy for ZIKV prevention, and knowledge about ZIKV symptoms further predicted vaccine willingness in travelers to other destinations. In multivariable analyses, only concern about ZIKV infection was associated with vaccine willingness in both groups (prevalence ratio [95% confidence interval]: Florida and/or Texas: 1.34 [1.06, 1.69]; other: 1.82 [1.44, 2.29]). Targeted communications can educate travelers, particularly travelers who are pregnant or may become pregnant, about ZIKV risk to generate ZIKV vaccine demand.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Florida', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Pregnancy', 'Texas', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Young Adult', 'Zika Virus', 'Zika Virus Infection']",29692314,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['Z01.107.567.875.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['E01.370.500', 'E05.318.308.980.438.580', 'N02.421.726.233.443', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.580', 'N06.850.780.500'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['Z01.107.567.875.760.750'], ['I03.883'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.530.890', 'E05.478.550.600.890', 'N02.421.726.758.310.890', 'N06.850.780.200.425.900', 'N06.850.780.680.310.890'], ['D20.215.894.899'], ['M01.060.116.815'], ['B04.820.578.344.350.995'], ['C01.920.500.990', 'C01.925.081.990', 'C01.925.782.350.250.990']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6174,Bezafibrate induces acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA levels and fatty acid peroxisomal beta-oxidation in rat white adipose tissue.,"Rats treated with bezafibrate, a PPAR activator, gain less body weight and increase daily food intake. Previously, we have related these changes to a shift of thermogenesis from brown adipose tissue to white adipose tissue attributable to bezafibrate, which induces uncoupling proteins (UCP), UCP-1 and UCP-3, in rat white adipocytes. Nevertheless, UCP induction was weak, implying additional mechanisms in the change of energy homeostasis produced by bezafibrate. Here we show that bezafibrate, in addition to inducing UCPs, modifies energy homeostasis by directly inducing aco gene expression and peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation in white adipose tissue. Further, bezafibrate significantly reduced plasma triglyceride and leptin concentrations, without modifying the levels of PPARgamma or ob gene in white adipose tissue. These results indicate that bezafibrate reduces the amount of fatty acids available for triglyceride synthesis in white adipose tissue.","['Acyl-CoA Oxidase', 'Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Bezafibrate', 'Body Weight', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol', 'Fatty Acids', 'Hypolipidemic Agents', 'Leptin', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Oxidoreductases', 'Oxygen', 'Peroxisomes', 'RNA', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors', 'Triglycerides']",11216866,"[['D08.811.682.660.150.200', 'D12.776.331.149'], ['A10.165.114'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.065.277.067', 'D02.241.081.114.968.500.249', 'D02.241.223.100.100.120', 'D02.241.223.100.200.249', 'D02.355.726.305.249', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.085.101', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.250.249', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.654.305.249'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['A11.251'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197', 'D10.570.938.208'], ['D10.251'], ['D27.505.519.186.071', 'D27.505.954.557.500'], ['D06.472.699.042.500', 'D12.644.276.024.500', 'D12.644.548.011.500', 'D12.776.467.024.500', 'D23.529.024.500'], ['A03.620'], ['D08.811.682'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.500.585.600', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.190.755.600'], ['D13.444.735'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.826'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D12.776.930'], ['D10.351.801']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
42074,The objective evaluation of the severity of psoriatic scales with desquamation collecting tapes and image analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Assessment of psoriatic scales is important to determine the severity of psoriasis. However, there are very limited numbers of objective, quantitative and observer-independent tools for measuring the severity of psoriasis.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the bioengineering parameters of the psoriatic scale can be used to assess the severity of psoriasis instead of the psoriatic severity index of scales (PSIs) score.METHODS: Thirty-four patients with psoriasis were included. A representative lesion from each patient was selected and bioengineering parameters were measured using the Corneofix(®). Simultaneously, the severity of the scales was assessed by the PSIs score using clinical photographs of the lesions. In addition, skin color and elasticity parameters were also measured using the Colorimeter(®), the Mexameter(®) and the Cutometer(®).RESULTS: Statistical differences in the scale parameters were observed between the PSIs 2 and 3 scores. Among the scale parameters, the percent area and area in ìm(2) were negatively correlated with the PSIs score. In addition, the Colorimeter(®) a, b parameters and the Cutometer(®) R9 parameters were significantly correlated with the PSIs score.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that the severity of psoriatic scales could be measured objectively using the Corneofix(®).","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bioengineering', 'Child', 'Colorimetry', 'Dermoscopy', 'Elasticity Imaging Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Photography', 'Psoriasis', 'Reference Standards', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Surgical Tape', 'Young Adult']",21507073,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['J01.293.069'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E05.196.922.250'], ['E01.370.350.515.277.250', 'E05.595.185.250'], ['E01.370.350.850.270'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.600', 'E05.712'], ['C17.800.859.675'], ['E05.978.808'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E07.858.690.800'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
13602,Microbial Disruption Indices to Detect Colonization With Multidrug-Resistant Organisms.,"OBJECTIVE To characterize the microbial disruption indices of hospitalized patients to predict colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). DESIGN A cross-sectional survey of the fecal microbiome was conducted in a tertiary referral, acute-care hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS The study population consisted of adult patients hospitalized in general medical/surgical wards. METHODS Rectal swabs were obtained from patients within 48 hours of hospital admission and screened for MDRO colonization using conventional culture techniques. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to assess the fecal microbiome. Microbial diversity and composition, as well as the functional potential of the microbial communities present in fecal samples, were compared between patients with and without MDRO colonization. RESULTS A total of 44 patients were included in the study, of whom 11 (25%) were colonized with at least 1 MDRO. Reduced microbial diversity and high abundance of metabolic pathways associated with multidrug-resistance mechanisms characterized the fecal microbiome of patients colonized with MDRO at hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that microbial disruption indices may be key to predicting MDRO colonization and could provide novel infection control approaches.

For strains efficiently degrading cellulose, a highest enzyme activity was confirmed using filter paper test, and it resulted in a range from 1.01 to 7.15 FPU/ml. Based on morphological and molecular analysis, the isolates were identified as Trichoderma. The most frequently identified strains belonged to Trichoderma harzianum species. Among all strains, the most effective in degradation of cellulose and xylose was T. harzianum and T. virens, especially those isolated from forest wood, forest soil or garden and mushroom compost. The results of this work confirmed that numerous strains from the Trichoderma species have high cellulose and xylan degradation potential and could be useful for lignocellulose biomass conversion e.g. for biofuel production.","['Biomass', 'Cellulase', 'Cellulose', 'Ecosystem', 'Lignin', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Temperature', 'Trichoderma', 'Wood', 'Xylans']",30015456,"[['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['D08.811.277.450.420.200.200'], ['D05.750.078.562.180', 'D09.698.365.180', 'D25.720.099.500', 'J01.637.051.720.099.500'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['D05.750.078.562.180.515', 'D05.750.078.687', 'D20.538', 'D25.720.099.687', 'J01.637.051.720.099.687'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.555', 'N06.850.425.300'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['B01.300.381.910'], ['A18.450.500.500', 'J01.637.241.900'], ['D09.698.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0
34230,Comparison of the prognostic value of tumour- and patient-related factors in patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for colon cancer.,"AIM: To comprehensively compare the prognostic value of tumour- and patient-related factors in patients undergoing curative surgery for colon cancer.METHOD: From a database of 287 patients who underwent elective resection between 1997 and 2005, tumour factors including stage and host factors including systemic inflammatory response [modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS)] were identified.RESULTS: Median follow-up was 65 months. Over this period, 125 patients died, 80 from cancer. On multivariate analysis of all significant patient and tumour related factors, Dukes stage (P < 0.01), vascular invasion (P < 0.01) and the mGPS (P < 0.01) were independently associated with cancer-survival. Of the patient-related factors, age (P < 0.01), haemoglobin (P < 0.01), white-cell (P < 0.01), neutrophil (P < 0.01) and platelet (P < 0.01) counts, and alkaline phosphatase (P < 0.01) were most significantly associated with the mGPS.CONCLUSION: In addition to tumour-related factors such as Dukes stage and vascular invasion, the preoperative mGPS should be included to guide prognosis in patients undergoing curative resection for colon cancer.","['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cause of Death', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemoglobins', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",19555389,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['D23.101'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107', 'E01.370.225.625.107', 'E05.200.500.195.107', 'E05.200.625.107', 'E05.242.195.107', 'G04.140.107', 'G09.188.105'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.250', 'N01.224.935.698.100', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.250', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.250'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['D12.776.124.400', 'D12.776.422.316.762'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

24868,Mapping by synthetic peptides of the binding sites for acetylcholine receptor on alpha-bungarotoxin.,"A set of seven peptides constituting the various loops and most of the surface areas of alpha-bungarotoxin (BgTX) was synthesized. In appropriate peptides, the cyclical (by a disulfide bond) monomers were prepared. In all cases, the peptides were purified and characterized. The ability of these peptides to bind Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor (AChR) was studied by radiometric adsorbent titrations. Three regions, represented by peptides 1-16, 26-41, and 45-59, were able to bind 125I-labeled AChR and, conversely, 125I-labeled peptides were bound by AChR. In these regions, residues Ile-1, Val-2, Trp-28, Lys-26 and/or Lys-38, and one or all of the three residues Ala-45, Ala-46, and Thr-47, are essential contact residues in the binding of BgTX to receptor. Other synthetic regions of BgTX showed little or no AChR-binding activity. The specificity of AChR binding to peptides 1-16, 26-41, and 45-59 was confirmed by inhibition with unlabeled BgTX. It is concluded that BgTX has three main AChR-binding regions (loop I with N-terminal extension and loops II and III extended toward the N-terminal by residues 45-47).","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Bungarotoxins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Receptors, Cholinergic']",3255383,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D12.125'], ['D20.888.850.325.139', 'D23.946.833.850.325.139'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E05.196.181.400.454.720', 'E05.196.401.319.720', 'E05.196.700', 'E05.393.760.705.685'], ['D12.644'], ['D12.776.543.750.720.360']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
34427,Hepatitis C virus core protein blocks interferon signaling by interaction with the STAT1 SH2 domain.,"Emerging data have indicated that hepatitis C virus (HCV) subverts the host antiviral response to ensure its persistence. We previously demonstrated that HCV protein expression suppresses type I interferon (IFN) signaling by leading to the reduction of phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1). We also demonstrated that HCV core protein directly bound to STAT1. However, the detailed mechanisms by which HCV core protein impacts IFN signaling components have not been fully clarified. In this report, we show that the STAT1 interaction domain resides in the N-terminal portion of HCV core (amino acids [aa] 1 to 23). This domain is also required to produce P-STAT1 reduction and inhibit IFN signaling transduction. Conversely, the C-terminal region of STAT1, specifically the SH2 domain (aa 577 to 684), is required for the interaction of HCV core with STAT1. The STAT1 SH2 domain is critical for STAT1 hetero- or homodimerization. We propose a model by which the binding of HCV core to STAT1 results in decreased P-STAT, blocked STAT1 heterodimerization to STAT2, and, therefore, reduced IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 binding to DNA and disrupted IFN-stimulated gene transcription.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hepacivirus', 'Humans', 'Interferons', 'Models, Genetic', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Core Proteins', 'src Homology Domains']",16940534,"[['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.440', 'D12.776.467.374.440', 'D23.529.374.440'], ['E05.599.395.397'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.644.360.024.303.500.500', 'D12.644.360.024.342.100', 'D12.776.157.057.061.500.500', 'D12.776.157.057.186.100', 'D12.776.260.513.249.500', 'D12.776.476.024.386.500.500', 'D12.776.476.024.430.100', 'D12.776.930.354.249.500', 'D12.776.930.840.100'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D12.776.964.970.600.850'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.750.500.750']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
20040,A Highly Active Form of XCL1/Lymphotactin Functions as an Effective Adjuvant to Recruit Cross-Presenting Dendritic Cells for Induction of Effector and Memory CD8+,"The chemokine receptor XCR1 is known to be selectively expressed by cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs), while its ligand XCL1/lymphotactin is mainly produced by activated CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. Recent studies have shown that XCL1-antigen fusion proteins efficiently induce CD8+ T cell responses by preferentially delivering antigens to XCR1+ DCs. However, XCL1 per se was found to be a poor adjuvant for induction of CD8+ T cell responses. XCL1 is unique because of its lack of one of the two disulfide bonds commonly conserved in all other chemokines and thus has an unstable structure with a relatively weak chemokine activity. In the present study, we generated a variant form of murine XCL1 termed mXCL1-V21C/A59C that contained a second disulfide bond to stabilize its chemokine structure. We confirmed that mXCL1-V21C/A59C had much more potent chemotactic and calcium mobilization activities than the wild type XCL1 (mXCL1-WT). Intradermal injection of mXCL1-V21C/A59C, but not that of mXCL1-WT, significantly increased the accumulation of XCR1+CD103+ DCs in the injection site, and most of the accumulated XCR1+CD103+ DCs were found to take up co-injected ovalbumin (OVA). Furthermore, recruited XCR1+CD103+ DCs efficiently migrated to the draining lymph nodes and stayed for a prolonged period of time. Consequently, mXCL1-V21C/A59C strongly induced OVA-specific CD8+ T cells. The combination of OVA and mXCL1-V21C/A59C well protected mice from E.G7-OVA tumor growth in both prophylactic and therapeutic protocols. Finally, memory CTL responses were efficiently induced in mice immunized with OVA and mXCL1-V21C/A59C. Although intradermal injection of OVA and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) as an adjuvant also induced CD8+ T cell responses to OVA, poly (I:C) poorly recruited XCR1+CD103+ DCs in the injection site and failed to induce significant memory CTL responses to OVA. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that a highly active form of XCL1 is a promising vaccine adjuvant for cross-presenting DCs to induce antigen-specific effector and memory CD8+ T cells.","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antigens, CD', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Calcium', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokines, C', 'Cross-Priming', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Integrin alpha Chains', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Lymphokines', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Ovalbumin', 'Sialoglycoproteins']",30542351,"[['D27.505.696.477.067'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.050'], ['D23.050.301.264.035', 'D23.101.100.110'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.220', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.220', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.220'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.100', 'D12.776.467.374.200.100', 'D23.125.300.100', 'D23.469.200.100', 'D23.529.374.200.100'], ['G12.450.050.400.545.150', 'G12.565.150'], ['A11.066.270', 'A11.436.270', 'A15.382.066.270', 'A15.382.670.260'], ['G12.450.050.500'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.408.100'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.537', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.537', 'A15.382.490.555.567.537'], ['D12.644.276.374.480', 'D12.776.467.374.480', 'D23.529.374.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['D12.644.861.557', 'D12.776.034.614', 'D12.776.256.159.157.663', 'D12.776.290.663', 'D12.776.872.557'], ['D12.644.233.800', 'D12.776.395.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
21961,"Constipation in the elderly from Northern Sardinia is positively associated with depression, malnutrition and female gender.","OBJECTIVES: Constipation is a common complaint in older adults. The rise in life expectancy may amplify the problem and increase social expenditure. We investigated the major risk factors associated with constipation in a large sample of elderly.METHODS: Outpatients from Northern Sardinia attending a Geriatric Unit between 2001 and 2014 were enrolled. Demographic and anthropometric data, income, education and self-reported bowel function were collected. The presence of constipation was adjusted for cognitive status, assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test; single and cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS); current or past symptomatic depression and anxiety measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS); nutritional status, evaluated using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA); type and number of different medications used.RESULTS: 1328 elderly patients (mean age 77.7 ± 7.2 years) were enrolled. Constipation was present in 32.1%, more commonly in women (35.4% vs 28.3%) and increased with age. The multivariate analysis showed a significantly greater risk of constipation in patients with a risk of malnutrition (OR = 1.745, 95% CI: 1.043-2.022; p = .034), female gender (OR = 1.735, 95% CI: 1.068-2.820; p = .026) and depression (OR = 1.079, 95% CI: 1.022-1.140; p = .006). Other potential predisposing factors assessed such as MMSE, CIRS, body mass index, marital status, smoking habit, education, income and number of taken drugs did not show a statistically significant association. Aging was a risk for constipation also in patients free of medications.CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of risk factors associated with bowel alterations in elderly individuals may provide important clues for caregivers to prevent or reduce constipation.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Body Mass Index', 'Constipation', 'Depression', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Malnutrition', 'Mental Status Schedule', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional Status', 'Outpatients', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",29779417,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G07.345.124'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['C23.888.821.150'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['E05.318.308.225', 'I01.240.425.350', 'N01.224.425.350', 'N05.715.360.300.360', 'N06.850.505.400.425.350', 'N06.850.520.308.225'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.542.489'], ['C18.654.521'], ['F04.711.513.603.500', 'F04.711.513.653.574'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['E05.318.308.585', 'N05.715.360.300.560', 'N06.850.505.557', 'N06.850.520.308.585'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['M01.643.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
34987,Delay of early B-lymphocyte development by gamma 2b immunoglobulin transgene: effect on differentiation-specific molecules.,"Mice transgenic for gamma 2b Ig heavy chain were examined for alterations in B-cell differentiation and endogenous Ig gene rearrangement and expression. Fresh bone marrow from these mice was markedly reduced in BP-1+ cells and there were small reductions in B220+ and sIg+ cells. A-MuLV (Abelson murine leukemia virus) transformants from these bone marrow cells showed little alteration in Ig gene rearrangement and expression when compared to controls, however. Isolation of the B-lymphoid compartment from these mice in vitro using LBMC (lymphoid bone marrow cultures) enabled more detailed characterization of the effects of the transgene. LBMC derived from gamma 2b transgenic mice had similar growth kinetics, but a 4-5-week delay in the expression of endogenous mu Ig in comparison to control cultures. Nucleic acids derived from these early cultures prior to endogenous mu Ig expression showed reduced Ig JH rearrangements, some sterile mu transcription, low levels of BP-1 expression, and virtually undetectable TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) expression. Thus, this gamma 2b transgene appears able to affect early B-lymphocyte development.","['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Culture Techniques', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1967016,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['A15.382.216'], ['A11.148', 'A15.378.316'], ['G04.152'], ['E05.481.500'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.344.801.311', 'G12.500.287.311'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.335', 'G12.500.299'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393.522', 'D12.776.124.486.485.705.500.380', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393.522', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.500.380', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393.522', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.500.380'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.574.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.705.500.500', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.574.500', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.500.500', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.574.500', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4278,Protease activation and the signal transduction pathway regulating motility in sperm from the water strider Aquarius remigis.,"Many motile processes are regulated such that movement occurs only upon activation of a signaling cascade. Sperm from a variety of species are initially quiescent and must be activated prior to beating. The signaling events leading to the activation and regulation of sperm motility are not well characterized. Mature seminal vesicle sperm from the water strider Aquarius remigis are immotile in vitro, but vigorous motility is activated by trypsin. Trypsin-activated motility was blocked by pretreatment of the sperm with BAPTA-AM to chelate intracellular Ca(2+) and was partially rescued by subsequent addition of A23187 and Ca(2+). Thapsigargin stimulated motility in the absence of trypsin, suggesting that intracellular Ca(2+) stores are available. In addition, motility could be fully activated by the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A, suggesting that the immotile state is maintained by an endogenous phosphatase and that kinase activity is required for motility. The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly reduced trypsin activated motility, and MPM-2, an antibody which recognizes proline-directed phosphorylation by kinases such as MAPK, recognized components of the water strider sperm flagellum. Antibodies specific for the mouse protease activated receptor PAR2 recognized an antigen on the sperm flagellum. These results suggest that trypsin stimulates a Ca(2+) and MAPK mediated signaling pathway and potentially implicate a PAR2-like protein in regulating motility.","['Animals', 'Calcium', 'Egtazic Acid', 'Heteroptera', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Marine Toxins', 'Oxazoles', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases', 'Receptor, PAR-2', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sperm Motility', 'Spermatozoa', 'Staurosporine', 'Thapsigargin', 'Trypsin']",22278949,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D02.092.782.258.368.257', 'D02.241.081.018.269'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.412.420'], ['G02.111.820.560', 'G03.493.560', 'G04.835.560'], ['D23.946.580'], ['D03.383.129.462'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D27.505.519.389.755'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.035', 'D12.776.543.750.792.249'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['E01.370.225.992.812', 'E05.200.992.812', 'G04.198.750'], ['A05.360.490.890', 'A11.497.760'], ['D03.132.436.750', 'D03.633.100.473.144.750', 'D03.633.100.473.402.750', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.750', 'D03.633.300.148.750'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.284.500.888', 'D02.455.849.765.674.500.750.888', 'D04.663.500.750.888'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.895', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.895']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27735,Pulmonary function in aluminium smelter and surrounding community--a case study.,"The increase of industrial activities in the Angul-Talcher area, Orissa resulted in indiscriminate disposal of waste into the environment leading to the deterioration of the quality of the environment, which affects the health of the workers as well as the community people. Considering the magnitude of the problem, the pulmonary function study had been carried out in one of the largest aluminium producing plant of the country as well as surrounding community people. Aluminium is produced from oxides of alumina by Hall-Heroult smelting process. The electrolysis called as aluminium smelting is carried out in an electrolytic cell (pot) having anode, cathode and electrolyte. The aluminium is deposited in the cathode and the oxygen moves towards anode is released. The workers working at the captive power plant (CPP), which is necessary to meet the power demand of the smelter plant were also investigated. 180 smelter plants workers (non-smoker 129, smoker-51) of different sections and 37 captive power plant workers (non-smoker 29, smoker-8) had undergone pulmonary function tests. Besides these, 85 persons from the surrounding community (non-smoker-66, smoker-19) were also investigated. The workers were all male. Spirometric assessments of Vital Capacity (VC), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) were done by Spirovit-sp-10 (Schiller Health Care Ltd, Switzerland) and Wrights Peak flow meter (Clement and Clarke, UK). Different lung volumes like FEV1, FEV1%, and flow rates like FEF200-1200ml, FEF25-75% and FEF75-85% were calculated from the same tracings pulmonary function test (PFT) results of the workers according to different age groups, duration of exposures and smoking habits. The mean values of SVC, FVC and FEV1 of smelter plant workers were found higher compared to the community people but the values of captive power plant workers were very much close to the values of the community people. A gradual decrement of the PFT values was found as duration of exposure increased. Lung volumes and the flow rates were decreased as age increases but in some age groups that trend was not followed. It has been found that in each category of subjects, smokers have the higher mean pulmonary function values compared to the non-smokers. Except the community people in all other cases the different flow rates were found higher in nonsmokers compared to smokers. The restrictive, obstructive and combined restrictive and obstructive types of impairments among the subjects were noticed. The respiratory impairment among the workers as a whole was found higher in smelter plant workers (9.44%) followed by the captive power plant workers (5.40%) and the community people (2.35%). In smelter plant workers both the restrictive and obstructive impairments were found higher compared to captive power plant and the community people.","['Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational', 'Aluminum', 'Forced Expiratory Volume', 'Humans', 'Industrial Waste', 'Lung', 'Lung Diseases, Obstructive', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Vital Capacity']",18476380,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.888.284.101.268'], ['D01.268.557.050', 'D01.552.547.050'], ['E01.370.386.700.660.230', 'G09.772.650.430'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D20.944.420', 'N06.850.460.710.420'], ['A04.411'], ['C08.381.495'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C24'], ['N06.850.460.350.600'], ['F01.145.805'], ['E01.370.386.700.750'], ['E01.370.386.700.485.750.900', 'G09.772.850.970']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
13540,Behavioral and neurochemical studies on brain aging in galanin overexpressing mice.,"To study possible involvement of galanin in brain aging quality, we have investigated behavioral, neurochemical and morphological parameters in aged mice overexpressing galanin under the platelet-derived growth factor B promoter (GalOE mice) compared to wild-type littermates (WT mice). The behavioral analysis in the forced swim test showed that old GalOE animals spent more time in immobility compared to WT. In the activity cage test, galanin overexpression counteracted the age-induced decrease in exploratory behavior. The neurochemical analysis showed a 30% decrease in noradrenaline overflow in the cerebral cortex of WT old mice that was not present in age-matched GalOE mice. Our results indicate that overexpression of galanin can influence several behavioral and neurochemical parameters in old mice.","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain', 'Depression', 'Dopamine', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Galanin', 'Gene Expression', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Norepinephrine', 'Tritium']",15944027,"[['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050'], ['F01.470.132'], ['F01.145.113'], ['A08.186.211'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['F01.145.387', 'F01.658.370'], ['D12.644.400.250', 'D12.776.631.650.250'], ['G05.297'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['D02.033.100.291.502', 'D02.092.063.480', 'D02.092.211.215.746', 'D02.092.311.830', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.830'], ['D01.268.406.875', 'D01.362.340.875', 'D01.496.749.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
30739,"Anthocyanin-rich extracts from blackberry, wild blueberry, strawberry, and chokeberry: antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect on oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis in vitro.","BACKGROUND: Limited information is available regarding the relationship between the chemical structures and inhibitory effects of anthocyanin (ACN) on triglyceride (TG) overaccumulation. Thus this study investigated the antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect of blackberry, wild blueberry, strawberry, and chokeberry ACN-rich extracts, with different structural characteristics, on oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis in vitro. Four major ACNs from these berries, with different aglycones, namely cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glu), delphinidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside, were also investigated.RESULTS: Blackberry ACN-rich extract exhibited the most significant inhibitory effect on TG clearance (30.5% ± 3.4%) and reactive oxygen species generation. TG clearance was significantly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.991, P < 0.05) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity value (r = 0.961, P < 0.05). Furthermore, Cy-3-glu showed the highest inhibitory effect on intracellular TG overaccumulation, with a maximum TG clearance of 61.3% at 40 µg mL(-1) .CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of different ACNs on oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis significantly vary. Cy-3-glu, which contains the ortho hydroxyl group in its B ring, possibly confers the protective effects of antioxidants and inhibits TG accumulation in HepG2 cells. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.","['Animals', 'Anthocyanins', 'Antioxidants', 'Blueberry Plants', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fragaria', 'Fruit', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Oleic Acid', 'Plant Extracts', 'Prunus', 'Rubus']",26250597,"[['B01.050'], ['D03.383.663.283.266.450.087', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.087', 'D09.408.084', 'D23.767.124'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.341.937.774.249'], ['C06.552.241'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.266'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['A11.251.860.180.432', 'A11.436.348.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G03.458'], ['D10.251.355.325.600.525'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.625'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.764']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
4934,Leukemia-derived exosomes induced IL-8 production in bone marrow stromal cells to protect the leukemia cells against chemotherapy.,"AIMS: The interplay between bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells plays a critical role in AML drug resistance by secreting growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles. As kind of extracellular vesicles, exosomes consist of proteins and RNAs and regulate communication among cells.MAIN METHODS: The BMSCs, HS5 cells, and AML cells were co-cultivated with transwell membranes, and treated with different doses of AML chemotherapy drug, etoposide.KEY FINDINGS: Findings of our research proved that co-cultivation of BMSCs with AML cells defended AML against cell death triggered via etoposide, without having an impact on cell growth. An increase in the expression of the 70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) as well as lysosomal associated membrane protein 3 (CD63) was observed in the exosomes from BMSC and AML, co-cultivated in conditioned media. Exosome repression in BMSC and AML co-cultivating system rebuilt the sensitivity of the KG1A cells to apoptosis triggered via etoposide, indicating that exosome modulated drug resistance in AML. Our study proved that exosomes arising from KG1A cells could propel BMSCs to generate IL-8, which could regulate the effect of etoposide treatment. Furthermore, IL-8 inhibition by its antibody increased the sensitivity of AML cells to cell death triggered via etoposide.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggested that exosomes secreted by AML cells is an essential communicator for the interaction of BMSCs and AML, which can protect AML cells from chemotherapy drug induced apoptosis.","['Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide', 'Exosomes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protective Agents', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",30716336,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['G07.690.773.984.395'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.638.960.675.250', 'D04.615.638.960.675.250', 'D09.408.348.275'], ['A11.284.295.588.750', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.880.495'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.120.800', 'D12.644.276.374.465.312', 'D12.776.467.374.200.120.800', 'D12.776.467.374.465.246', 'D23.125.300.120.800', 'D23.469.200.120.800', 'D23.529.374.200.120.800', 'D23.529.374.465.312'], ['C04.557.337.539.275'], ['A11.329.830.500', 'A11.872.590.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.223.500', 'E05.200.500.265.500', 'E05.242.223.500', 'E05.481.500.249.500'], ['D27.505.696.706', 'D27.720.799'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
32296,Systemic blood pressure after stent management for arch coarctation implications for clinical care.,"OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to prospectively assess blood pressure (BP) and echocardiographic parameters to delineate the incidence and nature of the hypertension burden in this cohort.BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the long-term outcomes of aortic stenting.METHODS: Thirty-one patients with successfully stented coarctation during childhood (mean age 12.4 years) underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), exercise BP measurement, and echocardiographic assessment.RESULTS: Mean time after stent implantation was 5.3 ± 4 years. Hypertension was noted on one-off right-arm BP assessment in 3 patients (10%), but on the basis of the 24-h ABPM assessment in 14 patients (45%). Twenty-four of 31 patients (80%) had an abnormally elevated exercise BP response. Peak exercise BP correlated with left ventricular mass index (r = 0.51; p < 0.05), which was also significantly increased in the entire cohort (mean = 91.3 g/m(2); p < 0.05). In patients with significant somatic growth since implantation, the indexed diameter of the stent (to aortic diameter) had significantly decreased from the 48th percentile at the implantation to the 4th percentile during the study (p < 0.05). There was no difference in any parameter between patients with native or those with recurrent coarctation.CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension is endemic in patients with stented coarctation, irrespective of the absence of residual obstruction. Due to abnormal BP homeostasis, hypertension should be aggressively pursued by ABPM assessment and exercise stress testing in this population.

42026,Laboratory testing of whole cell pertussis vaccine: a WHO proficiency study using the Kendrick test.,"Whole cell pertussis vaccine (WCV), commonly in combination with vaccines for diphtheria and tetanus, has an important role in reducing morbidity and mortality among children in most parts of the world. Testing to assure the efficacy of such vaccines is essential. We have, therefore, carried out, under the Global Training Network (GTN) of the Department of Vaccines and Biologicals at the World Health Organization (WHO), a proficiency study involving 13 laboratories in 12 countries that routinely test WCV. Two vaccine samples were tested in this study and represented samples which were expected clearly either to pass (sample B, a full strength vaccine) or to fail (sample A, 1/8 strength of vaccine B). Data from this study showed good performance by the majority of participants. Most assays were statistically valid and were carried out to the level of precision achieved for these assays in previous studies. This study also indicated that, relative to the assay precision, the in-house reference (IHR) preparations are in general accurately calibrated. Statistically valid assays of the sub-potent vaccine, A, showed it to fail in all except one laboratory. Statistically valid assays of the potent vaccine, B, showed it to pass in all laboratories. Nevertheless, the between laboratory variability of estimates for vaccine B, and for comparisons of the two vaccine samples suggested that there are some differences in results in different laboratories. The introduction of a common working standard may assist in reducing inter-laboratory variation. This study has shown clearly satisfactory performance by most laboratories. However, a serious problem was detected in one laboratory where the sub-potent vaccine A could have been passed and was not distinguished from the eight-fold more potent vaccine B. There were also indications of possible problems in several other laboratories, where IHR preparation may not be accurately calibrated or where vaccine samples A and B may not be completely distinguished. Although this study provides reassurance that most laboratories perform well, it demonstrates the essential role of ongoing proficiency studies in high-lighting problems.","['Animals', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Mice', 'Pertussis Vaccine', 'World Health Organization']",11672896,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.940.402', 'G07.225.500', 'G07.690.773.875.750', 'G07.690.936.500.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D20.215.894.135.535'], ['N03.540.514.718.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In this study, we attempt to analyze the independent and joint effect of variants from these loci on type 2 diabetes and clinical phenotypes related to glucose metabolism.METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from fourteen loci were successfully genotyped in 1,849 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 1,785 subjects with normal glucose regulation. We analyzed the allele and genotype distribution between the cases and controls of these SNPs as well as the joint effects of the susceptible loci on type 2 diabetes risk. The associations between SNPs and type 2 diabetes were examined by logistic regression. The associations between SNPs and quantitative traits were examined by linear regression. The discriminative accuracy of the prediction models was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. We confirmed the effects of SNPs from PPARG, KCNJ11, CDKAL1, CDKN2A-CDKN2B, IDE-KIF11-HHEX, IGF2BP2 and SLC30A8 on risk for type 2 diabetes, with odds ratios ranging from 1.114 to 1.406 (P value range from 0.0335 to 1.37E-12). But no significant association was detected between SNPs from WFS1, FTO, JAZF1, TSPAN8-LGR5, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2-ADAM30 and type 2 diabetes. Analyses on the quantitative traits in the control subjects showed that THADA SNP rs7578597 was association with 2-h insulin during oral glucose tolerance tests (P = 0.0005, empirical P = 0.0090). The joint effect analysis of SNPs from eleven loci showed the individual carrying more risk alleles had a significantly higher risk for type 2 diabetes. And the type 2 diabetes patients with more risk allele tended to have earlier diagnostic ages (P = 0.0006).CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The current study confirmed the association between PPARG, KCNJ11, CDKAL1, CDKN2A-CDKN2B, IDE-KIF11-HHEX, IGF2BP2 and SLC30A8 and type 2 diabetes.

21245,"Kinetic and mechanistic studies of the electrocatalytic reduction of O2 TO H2O with mononuclear Cu complexes of substituted 1,10-phenanthrolines.","Mononuclear Cu complexes with a 1,10-phenanthroline-based ligand adsorbed onto an edge-plane graphite electrode act as electrocatalysts for the 4-electron reduction of O2 to H2O. A mechanism is proposed for the electrocatalytic O2 reduction that accounts for the observed redox and kinetic dependences on coordinating anions and proton donors in the buffer. Systematic increases of ligand electron-withdrawing properties and/or the steric demands near the Cu center increase the E0 of the Cu catalysts but decrease the rate of O2 reduction. The kinetic rate of O2 reduction at E0, reported as kinetic current divided by catalyst redox charge, decreases as E0 increases: from 16 s(-1) measured at E0 in air-saturated solutions for adsorbed Cu(phen) to 0.4 s(-1) for Cu(2,9-Et2-phen). The maximum value of E for which catalytic activity can be attained is estimated to be +350 mV vs NHE. Near E0, the kinetic current deviates from that expected if O2 binding were the sole rate-limiting step. This indicates that one or more of the electrochemical reduction steps are rate limiting at potentials near E0.","['Catalysis', 'Copper', 'Kinetics', 'Oxygen', 'Phenanthrolines', 'Water']",18076134,"[['G02.130'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['D03.633.300.669'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

47424,Tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA) acquired in Southwestern Germany.,"BACKGROUND: Tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA) was first described in 1997 in a patient in France. The causative agent, Rickettsia slovaca, is transmitted by Dermacentor ticks.CASE PRESENTATION: In southwestern Germany we encountered a patient with a tick bite at the dorsal scalp that resulted in an eschar and nuchal lymphadenopathy. Additionally, fever, malaise as well as elevated inflammatory markers and transaminases occurred. The characteristic clinical picture along with positive antibody testing for rickettsiae of the tick-borne spotted fever group strongly suggest the diagnosis TIBOLA.CONCLUSION: Human rickettsioses are emerging infections. Clinicians should be aware of TIBOLA as a newly described rickettsial disease. As in our case, TIBOLA may be encountered in regions/countries where R. slovaca and Dermacentor ticks are prevalent but autochthonous acquisition was not described before.","['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial', 'Arachnid Vectors', 'Dermacentor', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Diseases', 'Rickettsia', 'Rickettsia Infections']",21663601,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.107', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.125', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.125'], ['N06.850.335.188.100.100', 'N06.850.520.203.375.100.100'], ['B01.050.500.131.166.132.832.400.200'], ['Z01.542.315'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C15.604'], ['B03.660.050.783.875.650.650'], ['C01.150.252.400.789.725', 'C01.920.914.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
12188,Primary stent angioplasty of the inferior vena cava after liver transplantation and liver resection.,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated technical efficacy and safety of stent angioplasty of the inferior vena cava (IVC) after liver transplantation or liver resection and analysis of changes in creatinine levels and patients' weight.METHODS: Between October 2004 and February 2011, 16 patients (mean age, 52.6 years) with symptomatic IVC stenoses after liver transplantation (n = 10) or liver resection (n = 6) were subjected to stent angioplasty. Enrollment criteria included edema and/or ascites. The smallest diameter of the IVC, serum creatinine values, and patients' weight were assessed before and after stent placement and respective values were compared. Technical and clinical success, patency rates, related complications, and patients' survival were analyzed.RESULTS: Stent placement was technically successful in 16 patients (100 %). Clinical success was achieved in 13 patients (81.25 %), reflecting two patients with early restenosis and one patient suffering from thrombosis distal to the stent. Mean follow-up was 372 days. Primary patencies were 75 % (n = 12). Primary assisted patencies were 93.75 % (n = 15). Serum creatinine levels decreased significantly (p = 0.01) from 1.68 mg/dl before to 1.08 mg/dl after stent placement. Patients' weight decreased (mean 2.1 %). No angioplasty-related complications occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Stent angioplasty of the IVC is an effective and safe treatment of stenoses after liver transplantation and resection and has a positive effect on creatinine levels.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Angioplasty', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Constriction, Pathologic', 'Creatinine', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Female', 'Hepatectomy', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stents', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Patency', 'Vena Cava, Inferior']",24091757,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E02.148.050', 'E04.100.814.529.124', 'E04.502.382.124', 'E05.157.016'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['M01.060.406'], ['C23.300.287'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['E01.370.350'], ['E04.210.556'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.552'], ['E02.095.147.725.490', 'E04.210.650', 'E04.936.450.490', 'E04.936.580.490'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E07.695.750'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['G09.330.920'], ['A07.015.908.949.648']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
12389,Results of chemotherapy for cats with alimentary malignant lymphoma: 21 cases (1993-1997),"OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and pathologic findings in cats with alimentary malignant lymphoma and results of treatment with a combination of prednisone, L-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and methotrexate.DESIGN: Retrospective study.ANIMALS: 21 cats with alimentary malignant lymphoma.PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed, and information on signalment, clinical history and signs, previous treatments, and results of laboratory tests, thoracic radiography, and abdominal ultrasonography were obtained.RESULTS: Test results in all cats were negative for FeLV; 3 of 19 were positive for feline immunodeficiency virus. Thirteen tumors were stage III, 7 were stage IV, and 1 was stage V. Diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of microscopic examination of histologic (n = 13) or cytologic (8) specimens. Immunophenotyping was performed on 13 tumors; 10 were T-cell and 3 were B-cell lymphomas. Overall median duration of first remission was 20 weeks. Overall median survival time was 40 weeks. The only factor significantly associated with duration of first remission was whether cats had a complete response following induction chemotherapy; duration of first remission was significantly associated with survival time. Cats tolerated treatment well; only 1 cat had a delay in the treatment schedule because of neutropenia.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Use of a multidrug chemotherapeutic protocol that includes L-asparaginase and doxorubicin results in minimal adverse effects and prolonged survival times in cats with alimentary malignant lymphoma.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Asparaginase', 'Cat Diseases', 'Cats', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Digestive System Neoplasms', 'Doxorubicin', 'Female', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma', 'Male', 'Methotrexate', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine']",9787382,"[['B01.050'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D08.811.277.087.116'], ['C22.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.377.750.250.125'], ['D02.455.526.728.650.730.243', 'D02.705.672.500.243'], ['C04.588.274', 'C06.301'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['E01.370.225.812.447', 'E05.200.812.447', 'E05.478.594.450'], ['C04.557.386', 'C15.604.515.569', 'C20.683.515.761'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.192.500'], ['E01.789.625'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.719.702'], ['E02.860'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D03.132.436.681.827.817', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.827.817', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.827.817']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
38662,Glucocorticoid receptor isoforms alpha and beta in in vitro cytokine-induced glucocorticoid insensitivity.,"We stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 14 healthy subjects, 14 patients with stable asthma, and 13 patients with unstable asthma with interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 to induce glucocorticoid insensitivity and we examined the relationship between insensitivity and the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) isoforms. Results are expressed as IC(50) (nanomolar) values (means +/- SD) in proliferation assays and as 10(3) cDNA molecules per microgram of total RNA (means +/- SD) in real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cells from patients with unstable asthma were less sensitive (316 +/- 7 nM) to dexamethasone antiproliferative effects than those from healthy control subjects (102 +/- 4 nM, p < 0.05) and patients with stable asthma (107 +/- 2 nM, p < 0.05). Coincubation with IL-2 and IL-4 repressed the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on proliferation in all groups (unstable: 851 +/- 47 nM, p < 0.01; stable: 912 +/- 52 nM, p = 0.001; control subjects: 537 +/- 45 nM, p = 0.001). GR-alpha mRNA baseline expression was higher in patients with unstable asthma [(1.95 +/- 0.40) x 10(3) cDNA molecules/microg total RNA, p < 0.05] than in patients with stable asthma [(1.46 +/- 0.35) x 10(3) cDNA molecules/microg total RNA] and healthy subjects [(1.35 +/- 0.25) x 10(3) cDNA molecules/microg total RNA]. GR-beta mRNA was 600 times lower than GR-alpha in the three groups. Coincubation with IL-2 and IL-4 significantly increased GR-alpha mRNA expression in the three groups (p < 0.01), but caused no significant change in GR-beta mRNA. GR-alpha, but not GR-beta, protein was detected at baseline and after cytokine exposure. Our data do not support the hypothesis that increased GR-beta expression can contribute to cytokine-induced glucocorticoid insensitivity.","['Adult', 'Asthma', 'Cytokines', 'Dexamethasone', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2', 'Interleukin-4', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Monocytes', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",15184204,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.769.344', 'D04.210.500.908.238'], ['D06.472.040.543', 'D27.505.696.399.472.488'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.021', 'D12.644.276.374.480.372', 'D12.776.467.374.465.021', 'D12.776.467.374.480.372', 'D23.529.374.465.155', 'D23.529.374.480.372'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.186', 'D12.776.467.374.465.178', 'D23.529.374.465.186'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['A11.118.637.555.652', 'A11.148.580', 'A11.627.624', 'A11.733.547', 'A15.145.229.637.555.652', 'A15.378.316.580', 'A15.382.490.555.652', 'A15.382.670.547', 'A15.382.680.547'], ['D12.776.800'], ['D12.776.826.750.430'], ['E05.393.620.500.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
212,Endovascular repair of complex aortic aneurysms: intravascular ultrasound guidance with an intracardiac probe.,"To assess the accuracy and efficacy of intravascular ultrasound guidance obtained by an intracardiac ultrasound probe during complex aortic endografting. Between November 1999 and July 2002, 19 patients (5 female, 14 male; mean age 73.5 +/- 2.1 years) underwent endovascular repair of thoracic (n = 10), complex abdominal (n = 6) and concomitant thoraco-abdominal (n = 3) aortic aneurysm. The most suitable size and configuration of the stent-graft were chosen on the basis of preoperative computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Intraoperative intravascular ultrasound imaging was obtained using a 9 Fr, 9 MHz intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) probe, 110 cm in length, inserted through a 10 Fr precurved long sheath. The endografts were deployed as planned by CTA or MRA. Before stent-graft deployment, the ICE probe allowed us to view the posterior aortic arch and descending thoraco-abdominal aorta without position-related artifacts, and to identify both sites of stent-graft positioning. After stent-graft deployment, the ICE probe allowed us to detect the need for additional modular components to internally reline the aorta in 11 patients, and to discover 2 incomplete graft expansions subsequently treated with adjunctive balloon angioplasty. In 1 patient, the ICE probe supported the decision that the patient was ineligible for the endovascular exclusion procedure. The ICE probe provides accurate information on the anatomy of the posterior aortic arch and thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms and a rapid identification of attachment sites and stent-graft pathology, allowing refinement and improvement of the endovascular strategy.","['Aged', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional']",14753303,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C14.907.055.239.075', 'C14.907.109.139.075'], ['C14.907.055.239.125', 'C14.907.109.139.125'], ['E01.370.350.130.750', 'E01.370.350.850.220', 'E01.370.370.380.220'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E01.370.350.850.855', 'E04.502.890']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
1398,Trauma-induced alterations in cognition and Arc expression are reduced by previous exposure to 56Fe irradiation.,"Exposure to ionizing irradiation may affect brain functions directly, but may also change tissue sensitivity to a secondary insult such as trauma, stroke, or degenerative disease. To determine if a low dose of particulate irradiation sensitizes the brain to a subsequent injury, C56BL6 mice were exposed to brain only irradiation with 0.5 Gy of (56) Fe ions. Two months later, unilateral traumatic brain injury was induced using a controlled cortical impact system. Three weeks after trauma, animals received multiple BrdU injections and 30 days later were tested for cognitive performance in the Morris water maze. All animals were able to locate the visible and hidden platform during training; however, treatment effects were seen when spatial memory retention was assessed in the probe trial (no platform). Although sham and irradiated animals showed spatial memory retention, mice that received trauma alone did not. When trauma was preceded by irradiation, performance in the water maze was not different from sham-treated animals, suggesting that low-dose irradiation had a protective effect in the context of a subsequent traumatic injury. Measures of hippocampal neurogenesis showed that combined injury did not induce any changes greater that those seen after trauma or radiation alone. After trauma, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of neurons expressing the behaviorally induced immediate early gene Arc in both hemispheres, without associated neuronal loss. After combined injury there were no differences relative to sham-treated mice. Our results suggest that combined injury resulted in decreased alterations of our endpoints compared to trauma alone. Although the underlying mechanisms are not yet known, these results resemble a preconditioning, adaptive, or inducible-like protective response, where a sublethal or potentially injurious stimulus (i.e., irradiation) induces tolerance to a subsequent and potentially more damaging insult (trauma).","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cognition', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Male', 'Maze Learning', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons']",21192069,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C10.228.140.199', 'C10.900.300.087', 'C26.915.300.200'], ['F02.463.188'], ['D12.776.220'], ['F02.463.425.874.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.776.631'], ['G04.152.912', 'G07.345.500.325.377.687', 'G08.686.784.170.450.500', 'G11.561.620'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
16638,"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders and associated factors among bank workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are dramatically increased in the world due to the advancement of technology and competitiveness of markets. There were limited studies carried out regarding WMSDs among bank workers in Africa particularly in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of work-related musculoskeletal disorders and associated factors among bank workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed in the study. Multi-stage sampling techniques were used to select 838 bank workers from 62 banks in Addis Ababa. Self-administered standard Nordic questionnaires were used as well. Multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were employed to identify factors associated with WMSDs. Moreover adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and p value < 0.05 was used to show the strength of association between explanatory variables and dependent variable.RESULTS: Out of 838 total numbers of participants, 755 bank workers returned their questionnaires responding with a rate of 90%. Of these, 77.6% (N = 586) suffered WMSDs with a 95% CI [75-81%]. Based on the final multivariate logistic regression analysis being female [AOR = 2.98, 95% CI 1.91-4.65], sitting back in a twisted position [AOR = 3.59, 95% CI 2.13-6.08], sitting back bent [AOR = 4.06, 95% CI 2.48-6.66], work on fixed position [AOR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.17-2.71], no work time break [AOR = 3.33, 95% CI 1.44-7.71], type of chairs [AOR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.19-5.75] and job stress [AOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.19-4.54] were factors significantly associated with WMSDs.CONCLUSION: From the study's findings, the magnitude of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among bank workers was high. Being female, awkward posture, no work time break, fixed position, type of chairs, and job stress are the factors significantly associated with WMSDs. So bank workers should use proper types of chairs, practice proper work posture, increase healthy working conditions, and create awareness programs on how to maintain beneficial health conditions which may lead to increased leisure time.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Banking, Personal', 'Cities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ethiopia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Occupational Diseases', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",32718332,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['N03.219.463.030.100'], ['G16.500.275.069', 'N06.230.069', 'Z01.433'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['Z01.058.290.120.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05'], ['C24'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Considerable debate has focused on how PVI should be defined, and the techniques used to detect them have differed considerably from one study to another.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our study, 167 cases of N- breast cancers were reviewed, with a view to determining whether or not PVI, as defined in the recently published European recommendations, were present.RESULTS: Based on the results of the subsequent statistical study, the presence of PVI was not found to constitute a reliable prognostic index to the outcome of N- breast cancer.CONCLUSION: Referring each case to the data available in the literature, the difficulties encountered when searching for PVI of this kind are described, the results of various studies on the topic are reviewed and whether it is worth pursuing studies along these lines is discussed.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Rate', 'Vascular Neoplasms']",10216503,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['C04.588.180.260', 'C17.800.090.500.260'], ['E02.186.170', 'E02.319.170'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['A11.642', 'C04.697.650.900', 'C23.550.727.650.900'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['C04.588.839.750', 'C14.907.936']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
11048,Carborane-derived local anesthetics are isomer dependent.,"Clinically there is a need for local anesthetics with a greater specificity of action on target cells and longer duration. We have synthesized a series of local anesthetic derivatives we call boronicaines in which the aromatic phenyl ring of lidocaine was replaced with ortho-, meta-, C,C'-dimethyl meta- and para-carborane clusters. The boronicaine derivatives were tested for their analgesic activity and compared with lidocaine using standard procedures in mice following a plantar injection. The compounds differed in their analgesic activity in the following order: ortho-carborane = C,C'-dimethyl meta-carborane > para-carborane > lidocaine > meta-carborane derivative. Both ortho-boronicaine and C,C'-dimethyl meta-boronicaine had longer durations of analgesia than lidocaine. Differences in analgesic efficacies are rationalized by variations in chemical structure and protein binding characteristics.","['Anesthetics, Local', 'Animals', 'Area Under Curve', 'Binding Sites', 'Boranes', 'Catalysis', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Lidocaine', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Pain', 'Palladium', 'ROC Curve', 'Serum Albumin']",25420874,"[['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.318.740.200', 'G03.787.101', 'G07.690.725.064', 'N06.850.520.830.200'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['D01.132.105', 'D02.203.087'], ['G02.130'], ['G02.111.570.120.704', 'G02.111.570.820.709.275.750.188'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.570.685', 'G02.607.445'], ['D02.065.199.092.500', 'D02.092.146.113.092.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E05.599.595.249', 'L01.224.160.249'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['D01.268.556.680', 'D01.268.956.718', 'D01.552.544.680'], ['E05.318.370.800.750', 'E05.318.740.872.750', 'N05.715.360.325.700.680', 'N06.850.520.445.800.750'], ['D12.776.034.841', 'D12.776.124.727']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
2338,"Common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is active neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (""enkephalinase""): direct evidence by cDNA transfection analysis.","The common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is a 749-amino acid type II integral membrane protein expressed by most acute lymphoblastic leukemias, certain other lymphoid malignancies with an immature phenotype, and normal lymphoid progenitors. A computer search against the most recent GenBank release (no. 56) indicates that human CALLA cDNA encodes a protein nearly identical to the rat and rabbit neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (""enkephalinase;"" EC 3.4.24.11). This zinc metalloendopeptidase, which has been shown to inactivate a variety of peptide hormones including enkephalin, chemotactic peptide, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, bradykinin, and angiotensins I and II, had not been identified in lymphoid cells. To determine whether CALLA cDNA derived from human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Nalm-6 cell line) encodes functional neutral endopeptidase activity, we generated CALLA+ stable transfectants in the CALLA- murine myeloma cell line J558 and analyzed them for enzymatic activity in a fluorometric assay based upon cleavage of the substrate glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide at the Ala-Phe bond. Total lysates as well as whole-cell suspensions of the Nalm-6 line and of the CALLA+ transfectants, but not of the CALLA- J558 cells, possessed neutral endopeptidase activity. This enzymatic activity was associated with the cellular membrane fraction and was abrogated by the specific neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon. The unequivocal identification of CALLA as a functional neutral endopeptidase provides insight into its potential role in both normal and malignant lymphoid function.","['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Glycopeptides', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neprilysin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transfection']",2521388,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.050.301.264', 'D23.101.100'], ['D23.050.285'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D13.444.308.425'], ['D09.400.420', 'D12.644.233'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.600', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.600', 'D23.050.285.550', 'D23.101.140.500'], ['C04.557.337.428.600', 'C15.604.515.560.600', 'C20.683.515.528.600'], ['E05.393.183.620.650', 'E05.393.712'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

6244,Ambulatory blood pressure variations relative to sitting or standing position in renal transplant patients.,"OBJECTIVE: High blood pressure is almost constant in renal transplant patients for whom dysautonomia is frequently described. The main objective of this study was to analyse the variations in blood pressure and heart rate recorded by ambulatory measurement during changes in position in renal transplant patients.METHODS: Thirty-nine non-diabetic renal transplant patients with a renal transplant functioning for more than a year, were selected at random. Blood pressure was measured using the validated monitor Diasys Integra with a position sensor to discriminate between standing and sitting/lying.RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly higher when the patient was standing than when sitting/lying (+2.9 mmHg, P<0.05 and +9 beats/min, P<0.001 respectively) and diastolic blood pressure tends to be higher (+1.7 mmHg, NS) when standing. One minute after standing up, the heart rate rises by about 9 beats/min (P<0.001) while systolic and diastolic blood pressures do not vary significantly. Variations in systolic blood pressure and heart rate on changing position are therefore in the same direction as those recorded in elderly normotensive or hypertensive untreated subjects, but with a lower amplitude.CONCLUSIONS: In most of non-diabetic functional renal transplant patients, there is an absence of an orthostatic decline in blood pressure. Thus, it could be considered that there is no real dysautonomia in this specific population.","['Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Renal', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Posture', 'Shy-Drager Syndrome']",15812257,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.370.140.100', 'E01.370.520.500.100'], ['G07.180.562.190'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.777.419.331', 'C13.351.968.419.331', 'C14.907.489.631'], ['E02.870.500', 'E04.936.450.485', 'E04.950.774.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G11.427.695'], ['C10.177.575.550.750', 'C10.228.140.079.612.700', 'C10.228.662.550.700', 'C14.907.514.741']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

14072,18F-FDG uptake for prediction EGFR mutation status in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are a response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, a lack of sufficient tumor tissue has been a limitation for determining EGFR mutation status in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to predict EGFR mutation status in NSCLC patients based on a model including maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and clinical features.We retrospectively reviewed NSCLC patients undergoing EGFR mutation testing and pretreatment positron emission tomography/computed tomography between March 2009 and December 2013. The relationships of EGFR mutations with both SUVmax and patient characteristics were evaluated, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. The model was assessed by area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and was prospectively validated during January to June 2014.Three hundred and sixteen patients meeting the criteria were enrolled for model construction. The SUVmax values were significantly lower for EGFR mutations (mean, 9.5 ± 5.74) than for EGFR wild-type (mean, 12.7 ± 6.43; P < 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that the SUVmax cutoff point was 8.1, for which the AUC was 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.72). In addition, multivariate analysis also showed that low SUVmax (?8.1) was a predictor of EGFR mutations, for which the AUC was 0.77, combining nonsmoking history and primary tumor size (?5 cm). Eighty-five patients were enrolled to validate the predictive model, and the overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 77.6%, 64.6% (95% CI 40.7-82.8), and 82.5% (95% CI 70.9-91.0), respectively.The specific FDG uptake value could be considered to effectively predict EGFR mutation status of NSCLC patients by considering smoking history and primary tumor size when genetic tests are not available.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies']",27472739,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.894.797.520.109.220.249', 'C08.381.540.140.500', 'C08.785.520.100.220.500'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074'], ['D09.254.229.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.370.350.350.800.700.500', 'E01.370.350.350.810.645', 'E01.370.350.567.500', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810.490', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800.399.500', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810.645', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810.723', 'E01.370.350.710.800.399.500', 'E01.370.350.825.800.399.500', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810.700', 'E01.370.384.730.800.399.500'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
655,Executive function impairment in early-treated PKU subjects with normal mental development.,"Executive functions were studied in 14 early and continuously treated PKU subjects (age 10.8 years, range 8-13) in comparison with controls matched for IQ, sex, age and socioeconomic status. Brain MRI examination was normal in all PKU patients. Neuropsychological evaluation included Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure Test, Elithorn's Perceptual Maze Test, Weigl's Sorting Test, Tower of London, Visual Search and Motor Motor Learning Test. Whatever the IQ, PKU subjects performed worse than controls in tests exploring executive functions. Subgrouping the PKU subjects according to the quality of dietary control for the entire follow-up period (using 400 micromol/L as cut-off value for blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration) showed that patients with worse dietary control performed more poorly than both the PKU group with the best dietary control and the control group. However, a mild impairment of executive functions was still found in PKU patients with a good dietary control (Phe <400 micromol/L) compared to controls. Concerning the PKU group as a whole, no linear correlation was found between neuropsychological performance and historical and concurrent biochemical parameters. We conclude that (a) PKU patients, even when treated early, rigorously and continuously, show an impairment of frontal lobe functions; (b) a protracted exposure to moderately high levels of Phe can affect frontal lobe functions independently of the possible effect of the same exposure on IQ; (c) in order to reduce the risk of frontal lobe dysfunction, the target of dietary therapy should be to maintain blood Phe concentration below 400 micromol/L.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Humans', 'Intelligence', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Phenylketonurias', 'Prognosis', 'Social Class']",15159642,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F03.615.250'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.543'], ['F04.711.513'], ['C10.228.140.163.100.687', 'C16.320.565.100.766', 'C16.320.565.189.687', 'C18.452.132.100.687', 'C18.452.648.100.766', 'C18.452.648.189.687'], ['E01.789'], ['I01.880.853.996.755', 'N01.824.782']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
32702,Impact of traumatic and violent victimization experiences in individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.,"Individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ) experience more violent victimization and noninterpersonal traumatic experiences than the general population. Earlier studies, however, have generally excluded one or grouped together victimization and trauma experiences into single outcome variables, which may obscure their contributory role to SZ symptoms. This issue is important because there is some evidence that intentionally induced violence produces higher rates of psychopathology than nonintentional traumatic experiences. We examined the independent contribution of both types of victimization experiences on SZ patients' symptomatology. We were also interested in determining whether SZ patients' pattern of acute symptom presentation could discriminate between SZ patients with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) comorbidity. SZ inpatients (n = 70) were assessed for the presence of comorbid PTSD diagnosis, violent victimization, and noninterpersonal traumatic experiences. Patients were also rated on SZ symptom severity and general psychopathology measures. Past violent victimization experiences predicted severity of dysphoria and anxiety in SZ. Past traumatic experiences, however, predicted severity of psychosis. Victimization predicted severity of patients' autistic/cognitive symptoms. SZ patients with comorbid PTSD presented with significantly more anxiety and dysphoria symptoms and SZ illness chronicity than their non-PTSD counterparts. Discriminant function analysis revealed that the severity of positive, dysphoric, autistic/cognitive, and anxiety symptoms differentiated comorbid PTSD patients from their non-PTSD counterparts, with an overall 72.9% classification rate. Past traumatic and victimization experiences are significantly associated with SZ patients' symptom severity and illness course in partially overlapping domains. Use of common assessment strategies may be employed to increase detection of PTSD in SZ patients presenting for acute treatment.","['Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Comorbidity', 'Crime Victims', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Violence']",20921860,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F03.080'], ['F03.625.164.113.500'], ['F03.615.250'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['M01.135'], ['L01.453.245.945.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.458.410'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['F03.700.675'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F03.700.750'], ['F04.824'], ['F03.950.750.500'], ['I01.198.240.856', 'I01.880.735.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0

23052,Direct Tracking of Particles and Quantification of Margination in Blood Flow.,"Margination refers to the migration of particles toward blood vessel walls during blood flow. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to margination will aid in tailoring the attributes of drug-carrying particles for effective drug delivery. Most previous studies evaluated the margination propensity of these particles via an adhesion mechanism, i.e., by measuring the number of particles that adhered to the channel wall. Although particle adhesion and margination are related, adhesion also depends on other factors. In this study, we quantified the margination propensity of particles of varying diameters (0.53, 0.84, and 2.11 ìm) and apparent wall shear rates (30, 61, and 121 s-1) by directly tracking fluorescent particles flowing through a microfluidic channel. The margination parameter, M, is defined as the total number of particles found within the cell-free layers normalized by the total number of particles that passed through the channel. In this study, an M-value of 0.2 indicated no margination, which was observed for all particle sizes in water. In the case of blood, larger particles were found to have higher M-values and thus marginated more effectively than smaller particles. The corresponding M-values at the device outlet were 0.203, 0.223, and 0.285 for 0.53-, 0.84-, and 2.11-ìm particles, respectively. At the inlet, the M-values for all particle sizes in blood were <0.2, suggesting that non-fully-developed flow and constriction may lead to demargination. For particle velocities transverse to the flow direction (vy), all particle sizes showed a larger standard deviation of vy as well as a higher effective diffusivity when the particles were suspended in blood relative to water. These higher values are attributed to collisions between the blood cells and particles, further supporting recent simulation results. In terms of flow rates, for a given particle size, the higher the flow rate, the higher the M-value.","['Animals', 'Blood', 'Cattle', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hemorheology', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Microfluidics', 'Models, Biological', 'Particle Size', 'Water']",27705771,"[['B01.050'], ['A12.207.152', 'A15.145'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['E05.830.250', 'G09.188.370', 'G09.330.380.630'], ['E07.305.343.500'], ['E05.830.666', 'H01.671.808.500', 'J01.897.520.500.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['G02.712'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
1639,Determination of 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) in human urine by liquid chromatography: direct injection with column switching.,"3TC (GR109714X) is a cytidine dideoxynucleoside analogue which has been shown to have in vitro activity against a variety of strains of HIV-1 and is currently being investigated in clinical trials as a treatment for HIV infection. An HPLC method for the determination of 3TC in human urine has been developed and validated. The method allows direct injection of urine (10 microliters) using HPLC column switching followed by UV detection. On-line extraction is performed using a Spherisorb-SCX (5 microns, 20 x 4.0 mm) eluted with deionized water at 1 ml min-1. 3TC is retained while the bulk of urine constituents are eluted to waste. The SCX column is then backflushed to a BDS-Hypersil-C18 (5 microns, 250 x 4.6 mm) and eluted with 100 mM acetate pH 4.5-methanol (95:5, v/v) for final separation. 3TC is detected by UV absorbance at lambda = 285. The quantitation range of the assay was 0.5-500 micrograms ml-1. The method has demonstrated sufficient ruggedness to be used in support of 3TC clinical trials. Application to other cytidine analogues including DDC has been demonstrated.","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Lamivudine', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Zalcitabine']",8003552,"[['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500.950.500', 'D13.570.230.329.950.500', 'D13.570.230.500.925.500', 'D13.570.685.245.500.950.500'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500.950', 'D13.570.230.329.950', 'D13.570.230.500.925', 'D13.570.685.245.500.950']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
38007,Subarachnoid morphine versus TAP blocks for enhanced recovery after caesarean section delivery: A randomized controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Subarachnoid morphine is widely used for pain relief in enhanced recovery program after cesarean section in spite of its side effects. However, the role of TAP block is still controversial. The aim of our study was to compare the impact of these analgesic techniques (subarachnoid morphine and TAP block) on enhanced recovery after cesarean section.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, we included patients scheduled for cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomized in two groups. Group I: received spinal anesthesia with 100ìg of subarachnoid morphine. Group II: received spinal anesthesia without subarachnoid morphine followed by an ultrasound-guided TAP block. We assessed the time required for mobilization, for re-establishment of gastrointestinal transit and for breast-feeding.RESULTS: TAP block allowed earlier postoperative mobilization. Time required for getting up was significantly lower in group II (9.4h versus 6.9h; P=0.024) as well as time required for walking (12.4h versus 7.4h; P=0.001). TAP block allowed earlier re-establishment of gastrointestinal transit (11.2h in group I versus 8.1h in group II; P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: TAP block seems to be suitable with enhanced recovery programs.","['Abdominal Muscles', 'Adult', 'Analgesics, Opioid', 'Anesthesia Recovery Period', 'Anesthesia, Obstetrical', 'Anesthesia, Spinal', 'Cesarean Section', 'Early Ambulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Morphine', 'Nerve Block', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain, Postoperative', 'Pregnancy', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional', 'Walking']",27080379,"[['A02.633.567.050'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.696.277.600.500', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.760.500', 'D27.505.954.427.040.550.500', 'D27.505.954.427.210.600.500'], ['E03.160', 'E04.614.750.055', 'N02.421.585.753.750.055'], ['E03.155.364'], ['E03.155.086.331'], ['E04.520.252.500'], ['E02.760.169.063.500.335', 'E02.831.335'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.132.577.249.562.571', 'D03.605.497.607.587', 'D03.633.400.686.607.587', 'D04.615.723.795.576.571'], ['E03.155.086.711', 'E04.525.210.550'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['C23.550.767.700', 'C23.888.592.612.832'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E01.370.350.850.855', 'E04.502.890'], ['G11.427.410.568.900', 'G11.427.410.698.277.937', 'I03.350.937', 'I03.450.642.845.940']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

41503,Lower Frequency of HLA-DRB1*01 in Southwestern Iranian Patients with Atherosclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a gene family involved in antigen presentation associated with protection or susceptibility to inflammatory, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which HLA molecules play a role in the initiation and development of the disease through presentation of self or foreign antigens to T cells.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of HLA-DRB1 alleles with atherosclerosis in a sample of southwestern Iranians.METHODS: We performed an analytical cross-sectional study involving 96 patients with atherosclerosis and 72 controls. HLA-DRB1 genotyping was performed by PCR-SSP method.RESULTS: We observed a significantly lower frequency of DRB1*01 in patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis than in controls (4.68% vs. 13.1, P=0.0052, OR=3.09, CI 95%: 1.35-7.05). However, this allele showed a positive association with high blood pressure (P=0.009) in patients. Furthermore, DRB1*16 allele was associated with hyperlipidemia (P=0.008) in patients.CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that DRB1*01 may be a protective allele against atherosclerosis in individuals who live in southwest of Iran. The mechanism of this protection needs further investigation.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Iran', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",30246695,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G12.119', 'G12.450.050.400.070'], ['C14.907.137.126.307'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['G05.330'], ['E05.393.385'], ['G05.380'], ['D12.776.395.550.509.400.440.200.010', 'D12.776.543.550.440.400.440.200.010', 'D23.050.301.500.400.400.440.200.010', 'D23.050.301.500.450.400.440.333.500', 'D23.050.705.552.410.400.440.200.010', 'D23.050.705.552.450.400.440.333.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['Z01.252.245.500.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G05.365.795']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
19772,The role of embolization for hemangiomas.,"We retrospectively studied 31 patients with painful bone (15 patients) and soft-tissue (16 patients) hemangiomas treated with 39 embolizations using N-2-butyl cyanoacrylate from 2003 to 2010. The mean tumor size before embolization was 6 cm for bone and 7 cm for soft-tissue hemangiomas. The technique of embolization was the same for bone and soft-tissue lesions. Preoperative embolization was done in six patients, while the remaining patients had embolization as only treatment. The mean follow-up was 47 months (11-89 months). The clinical and imaging effect of treatment was evaluated at follow-up with a pain score scale, tumor size, and ossification. In four patients, embolization was not feasible because of the inability to catheterize and low blood flow of the feeding vessels. Nine patients with bone and 10 with soft-tissue hemangiomas experienced complete pain relief. Four patients with bone and four with soft-tissue hemangiomas experienced recurrence of pain and were treated with repeat embolization. Re-recurrences were not observed in any of the patients with soft-tissue hemangiomas until the period of this study. Ossification and tumor size reduction were higher for bone hemangiomas. Embolization-related complications were more common for soft-tissue hemangiomas.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Enbucrilate', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fractures, Compression', 'Fractures, Spontaneous', 'Hemangioma', 'Humans', 'Humeral Fractures', 'Laminectomy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain Management', 'Preoperative Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Spinal Fractures', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Tissue Adhesives', 'Tumor Burden', 'Young Adult']",22684541,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.149', 'C05.116.231'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E02.186'], ['E02.520.360', 'E02.926.500'], ['D02.241.081.069.366.350', 'D02.626.290.350', 'D05.750.259.341', 'D25.720.259.341', 'D25.919.367.341', 'J01.637.051.720.259.341', 'J01.637.051.919.367.341'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C26.404.195'], ['C26.404.374'], ['C04.557.645.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C26.088.390', 'C26.404.500'], ['E02.718.563', 'E04.188.400', 'E04.525.450', 'E04.555.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.745', 'N04.590.607.500'], ['E02.760.795', 'E04.604.750', 'N02.421.585.795'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C04.588.839'], ['C26.117.500.500', 'C26.404.812'], ['E04.555.100.700'], ['D25.919', 'D27.720.102.919', 'E07.858.690.860', 'J01.637.051.919'], ['E05.041.124.892'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
44927,Wogonin modulates hydroperoxide-induced apoptosis via PI3K/Akt pathway in retinal pigment epithelium cells.,"BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress causes the defects of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that contribute to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study was conducted to determine whether wogonin could prevent H2O2-induced oxidative stress in RPE cells.METHODS: A RPE cell line, ARPE-19, was obtained for the cell model. ARPE-19 cells were pre-treated with various concentrations of wogonin for 24 h before being exposed to H2O2 for 2 h to induce oxidative stress. Cell metabolic activity was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cellular apoptosis was quantified by the flow cytometry. Protein level was assed by western blot.RESULTS: The RPE cells exposed to to 200 mM H2O2 demonstrated a significant depression in the cell viability; whereas pre-treatment with 50 and 100 mmol/l wogonin could significantly improve the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The proportion of PI-positive cells was increased significantly in RPE cells treated with H2O2 alone; whereas pretreatment with 100 mM wogonin significantly reduced H2O2 -induced RPE cell death rate. In protein level, the wogonin use could reduce the level of p-Akt significantly and this is the possible mechanism of the antioxidant effect of wogonin.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that wogonin pre-treatment can protect RPE cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis. This suggests potential effect of wogonin in the prevention of retinal diseases associated with H2O2-induced oxidative stress such as AMD.VIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/13000_2014_154.","['Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytoprotection', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Flavanones', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium', 'Signal Transduction']",25432585,"[['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G04.346'], ['G07.690.773.500'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['A11.436'], ['D03.383.663.283.266.450.252', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.252'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.424', 'D01.339.431.374.424', 'D01.650.550.750.400', 'D02.389.338.253'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.500.100'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.755', 'D12.776.476.565', 'D12.776.624.664.700.168'], ['A09.371.670.500', 'A09.371.729.887'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18065,Efficient Synthesis of a Wide-Range Absorbing Azaphthalocyanine Dark Quencher and Its Application to Dual-Labeled Oligonucleotide Probes for Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reactions.,"Unsymmetrical dialkylamino-substituted zinc azaphthalocyanine (AzaPc) exhibits unique spectral and photophysical properties for dark quenchers of fluorescence in DNA hybridization probes. The panchromatic light absorption of AzaPc from 300 nm up to at least 700 nm and its lack of fluorescence make it an ideal candidate for a universal dark quencher. To prove this experimentally, oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes were labeled at the 3'-end by this AzaPc and at the 5'-end by a fluorophore used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-that is, fluorescein, CAL Fluor Red 610, and Cy5. AzaPc showed a significantly higher quenching efficiency compared to the commercially available dark quenchers (BHQ-1, BHQ-2, BBQ-650) in a developed model of TaqMan PCR assay. The AzaPc-labeled probe proved to also be useful in a practical PCR assay for the quantification of the SLCO2B1 transporter gene expression. The constructed calibration curves indicated linearity in the range from 102 to 107 of target copies.","['DNA Probes', 'Fluorescein', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",29683215,"[['D13.444.600.223', 'D27.505.259.750.600.223', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223'], ['D02.455.426.779.347.390', 'D03.633.300.953.275.390', 'D04.711.347.390'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['D13.695.578.424.450'], ['D13.444.600.601', 'D27.505.259.750.600.650', 'D27.720.470.530.600.650'], ['E05.393.620.500.706']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25467,Effects of PTEN inhibition on regulation of tau phosphorylation in an okadaic acid-induced neurodegeneration model.,"One of pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of tau hyperphosphorylation remain largely unclear. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, however, potential functions and role of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in AD pathogenesis have not been fully explored. Here, we report that okadaic acid (OA)-induced tau phosphorylation is accompanied by PTEN induction, knockdown of PTEN reduces the tau hyperphosphorylation by OA in SH-SY5Y cells and increases cell proliferation and survival. The effect of PTEN suppression on tau dephosphorylation appeared to be mediated by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 while enhancing the Akt activity. Reduction of tau phosphorylation was also observed in the OA-induced parental SH-SY5Y cells co-treated with bisperoxovanadate (bpv), a potent PTEN inhibitor. Our studies provide evidence for an effect of PTEN on the phosphorylation of tau in AD pathogenesis and give some insight into the mechanisms through which suppression of PTEN expression may contribute towards the amelioration of tauopathy, implying that pharmacological intervention of PTEN may be a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Okadaic Acid', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'tau Proteins']",22906543,"[['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.346'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['G05.308.370'], ['D05.500.117.875', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.429.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.625', 'D12.644.360.300.500', 'D12.776.476.081.875', 'D12.776.476.300.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.543'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.590.650.550', 'C04.557.470.670.590.650.550', 'C04.557.580.625.600.590.650.550'], ['D02.355.291.705', 'D23.946.580.710'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.850', 'D12.776.476.590', 'D12.776.624.776.695'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['D12.776.220.600.450.510', 'D12.776.631.560.510']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3695,A 23-year review of the management of acute retention of urine: progressing or regressing?,"A retrospective review of all patients in Oxford under the care of one consultant urologist (GJF) who presented on alternate years over a 23-year period with acute retention of urine was undertaken. Data were collected on the: (i) number of patients discharged from hospital with an in-dwelling catheter; (ii) duration of catheter drainage prior to surgery; and (iii) duration of postoperative stay. In all, 244 patients underwent prostatectomy. Over the 23-year period, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients discharged prior to surgery (P < 0.001) as well as their median duration of catheterisation (P < 0.001): more than 50% were catheterised for more than 3 months in 1997. Conversely, post-operative hospital stay has decreased. Prolonged catheter drainage carries considerable morbidity, with 72% experiencing some complication. Most patients feel they lose dignity, 69% consider it uncomfortable and more than 50% complain of burning sensations, bladder spasms and a persistent desire to micturate. We recommend that patients should not be placed on routine waiting lists where they are liable to remain for an unacceptably long time. Targets should be set to admit them within a set period and theatre lists made available. We feel that six weeks is a realistic target.","['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Catheters, Indwelling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medical Audit', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary Retention', 'Waiting Lists']",11041033,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E07.132.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.761.700.250.500', 'N05.700.175.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.950.774.860.625'], ['C12.294.565.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.370.390.820', 'E02.148.947', 'E05.157.500'], ['C12.777.934.880', 'C13.351.968.934.880'], ['N04.452.095.738']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
5001,Mechanism of hypertensive nephropathy in the Dahl/Rapp rat: a primary disorder of vascular smooth muscle.,"The Dahl/Rapp salt-sensitive (S) rat is a model of salt-sensitive hypertension and hypertensive renal disease. This study explored the role of vascular remodeling in the development of renal failure in S rats. Groups of S and Sprague-Dawley rats were given 0.3 and 8.0% NaCl diets for up to 21 days and evidence of smooth muscle proliferation identified using immunohistochemistry that showed nuclear accumulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine. Compared with the other three groups, S rats on 8.0% NaCl diet showed increased nuclear labeling of cells of the aorta and arteries and arterioles of the kidney by the end of the first week of study. Progressive luminal narrowing of the interlobular arteries and preglomerular arterioles occurred in S rats over the 3 wk on the 8.0% NaCl diet. Accumulation of pimonidazole adducts and nuclear accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) were used as markers of tissue hypoxia. By the end of the second week of study, pimonidazole levels increased in S rats on 8.0% NaCl diet and deposition was apparent in tubular cells in the cortex and medulla. At the completion of the experiment, HIF-1alpha levels were increased in nuclear extracts from the cortex and medulla of S rats on this diet, compared with the other three groups of rats. The data demonstrated a disorder of the vascular remodeling process with proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells temporally followed by development of tissue hypoxia in the hypertensive nephropathy of S rats on 8.0% NaCl diet.","['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', 'Kidney', 'Male', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular', 'Nitroimidazoles', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Dahl', 'Renal Insufficiency', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Sucrose', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors']",15583217,"[['B01.050'], ['D03.383.742.680.852.300.150', 'D13.570.230.430.196', 'D13.570.685.852.300.150'], ['G03.197.300', 'G04.270.300'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['C14.907.489'], ['D12.776.260.103.625.750', 'D12.776.930.125.625.750'], ['A05.810.453'], ['A02.633.570.491', 'A07.015.733.500', 'A10.690.467.491'], ['D02.640.672', 'D03.383.129.308.658'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.165', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.165'], ['C12.777.419.780', 'C13.351.968.419.780'], ['D01.210.450.150.875', 'D01.857.650'], ['D09.698.629.305.770', 'D09.947.750.770'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15279,Corticopontine projection in the guinea pig. Electron microscopic study.,"Guinea pigs were subjected to unilateral thermocoagulation of the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortex, and were allowed to survive 4 and 7 days. Routine electron microscopic technique was employed to examine orthograde degenerative changes in the ipsilateral pontine nuclei. Following four days survival the degenerating corticofugal synaptic boutons (d.s.b.) exhibited features attributed to all three basic degeneration types: dark, filamentous, and light. Most of the synaptic boutons arising in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortex display filamentous degenerative changes, and measure approximately 3 micrometers. The temporopontine axons terminate as dark d.s.b. Also, some d.s.b. following frontal ablation (collaterals of the corticospinal tract?), and a small number of occipitopontine d.s.b. (visual associative cortex?), develop dark degenerative changes. Most of the dark d.s.b. measure less than 2 micrometer. The light d.s.b., with mean diameter 2 micrometer, are rarely found following frontal and occipital lesions. Following 7 days survival almost exclusively dark d.s.b. are to be observed--a great part of them, apparently, representing the late stage of the evolution of the filamentous and light degeneration.

12973,"Enhancement of BALB/c 3T3 cells transformation by 1,2-dibromoethane promoting effect.","Two of the most representative halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, were tested in the two-stage cell transformation model for analysing the promoting ability. Both of these compounds had previously been found to exert genotoxic effects, probably acting as moderate initiators. BALB/c 3T3 cells were initiated with subtransforming doses of N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or 3-methylcholanthrene and then exposed to a chronic treatment with different non-transforming dosages of the two haloalkanes. 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane did not exert any promoting activity in that system. By contrast, significant promoting effects by 1,2-dibromoethane were observed both in cells treated with N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and in cells treated with 3-methylcholanthrene. Promotion of the transformation process initiated with 3-methylcholanthrene was detectable when confluent cells in the chemical-treated plates were replated in the level-II amplification test. This experimental procedure allowed cells to perform further rounds of replications and transformed foci to became detectable. Results gave evidence for a promoting role of 1,2-dibromoethane in multistep carcinogenesis, probably responsible for the higher oncogenic ability of this compound with respect to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane.","['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethane', 'Ethylene Dibromide', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine', 'Mice', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",8625443,"[['A11.251.210.100', 'A11.329.228.100'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.888.569.100'], ['C04.697.098.500', 'C23.550.727.098.500'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D02.455.326.146.379'], ['D02.455.526.368.225'], ['D02.455.526.439'], ['D02.078.370.649.400', 'D02.654.567.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D02.455.849.291.500.510.850']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
556,The Early Postoperative Effects of Cochlear Implantation on Horizontal Semicircular Canal Function.,"OBJECTIVES: To use video head impulse testing to examine the effect of cochlear implantation (CI) on horizontal SCC vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain early after surgery, and to relate outcomes to subjective imbalance.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.SETTING: Academic tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Thirty-seven (23F:14M) adult cochlear implant recipients (mean age, 55; age range, 20-80).INTERVENTION: Cochlear implantation.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The VOR of the horizontal semicircular canal of both the operated and non-operated ears was examined using video head impulse testing before surgery and at days 1, 7, and 28 following surgery. VOR gain, VOR gain asymmetry, and the change in VOR gain from preoperative baseline where the primary outcome measures. Subjective imbalance was assessed using a structured questionnaire.RESULTS: VOR gain value for the operated ear was 0.88 ± 0.21. Mean VOR gain on day 1 postoperatively was 0.86 ± 0.19; on day 7, 0.87 ± 0.17, and on day 30, 0.91 ± 0.21. Before surgery median asymmery was -5.50%, on day 1 it was -5.30%, at day 7, -6.44%, and at day 30 it was -2.61%. There was no significant difference between these measures for the cohort across the four time points. Thirteen of 37 (35%) of patients experienced imbalance in the follow-up period, but this was not correlated to changes in VOR gain.CONCLUSION: Horizontal semicircular canal function is preserved in the immediate and early postoperative period. This suggests that horizontal semicircular canal impairment is not likely to be responsible for postoperative imbalance.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Female', 'Head Impulse Test', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Postural Balance', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reflex, Vestibulo-Ocular', 'Semicircular Canals', 'Sensation Disorders', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",29995005,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E04.580.450.220', 'E04.650.220'], ['E07.305.250.319.381.500.500', 'E07.695.150', 'E07.695.202.381.500.500', 'E07.814.458.150'], ['E01.370.382.900.640'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E04.614.750', 'N02.421.585.753.750'], ['F02.830.816.541.752', 'G07.888.750.500', 'G11.427.690', 'G11.561.790.541.595'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['G07.888.937', 'G11.561.731.795'], ['A09.246.300.663'], ['C10.597.751', 'C23.888.592.763'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
18583,Validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire for the Spondyloarthropathies.,"The Health Assessment Questionnaire for Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) was built by adding five new questions related with cervical and lumbar spine functions to HAQ by Daltroy et al. (in J Rheumatol 17(7):946-945, 1990). The aim of this study was to adapt the added five items into Turkish and then to test its reliability and validity. New questions were adapted to Turkish according to 'translation-back translation' method. Seventy-nine patients with ankylosing spondylitis were asked with the Turkish version of HAQ-S (HAQ-S TV). To assess, construct validity patients were evaluated by HAQ, Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI), Maastricht AS Enthesitis Score (MASES), Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL), and laboratory variables (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein). Construct validity was investigated with Spearmann's rank correlation coefficient. Reliability of HAQ-S TV was assessed by internal consistency. Inter- and intra-observer reliability were tested with Cronbach's alpha score. HAQ-S TV met set criteria of reliability and validity. Reliability of adapted version was found good with high internal consistency value. (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89). In addition to this intra-observer and inter-observer reliability were found adequate for total score of HAQ-S (Cronbach's alphas: 0.999 and 0.998 in order) and also for each added five questions (Cronbach's alphas >0.7). Positive correlations were found between HAQ-S TV and HAQ, BASFI, BASDAI, BASMI, MASES, ASQoL, ESR, and CRP (P < 0.05). The results of this study showed that HAQ-S TV was reliable and valid in patients with AS.","['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Sedimentation', 'C-Reactive Protein', 'Cervical Vertebrae', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Spondylarthropathies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Translating', 'Turkey', 'Young Adult']",21327435,"[['E02.760.169.063.500.067', 'E02.831.067', 'I03.050', 'N02.421.784.110'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D23.101'], ['E01.370.225.625.125', 'E05.200.625.125'], ['D12.776.034.145', 'D12.776.124.050.120', 'D12.776.124.486.157'], ['A02.835.232.834.151'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['C05.116.900.853.625.800', 'C05.550.114.865.800'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['L01.559.423.796'], ['Z01.252.245.500.850'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
23765,Fenofibrate increases serum creatinine in a patient with familial nephropathy associated to hyperuricemia.,"BACKGROUND: Kidney function progressively deteriorates in patients with familial juvenile hyperuricemiac nephropathy (FJHN, OMIN 162000) and chronic renal disease is commonly associated to dyslipidemia. We report for the first time abrupt renal insufficiency in a patient with FJHN and hypertrygliceridemia following fenofibrate administration.CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old man was diagnosed clinically with FJHN at age 24 years which was subsequently confirmed by genotypic analysis of the UMOD gene at age 40 years. His mother and two brothers suffered the disease. At that time, renal size and function were normal, as was his blood pressure and serum lipids. At age 34 years, serum urate was 8.5 mg/dL and creatinine 1.7 mg/dL (GFR, 58 mL/min/1.73 m2). He was treated with allopurinol, losartan, and lovastatin. Serum TG levels ranged between 150 and 250 mg/dL. At age 52 years, serum urate was 4.1 mg/dL, creatinine 3.2 mg/dL, LDLc 99 mg/dL (atorvastatin 40 mg/d), and TG 275 mg/dL. Fenofibrate (160 mg/d) was added. One month later, serum creatinine increased to 4.2 mg/dL and TG decreased to 125 mg/dL. He did not complain of muscle pain, weakness, or changes in urinary frequency or color and rabdomyolysis was discarded. Fenofibrate was withheld and three months later serum creatinine decreased to baseline levels (3.2 mg/dL) and TG increased to 197 mg/dL.CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first patient with FJHN in whom fenofibrate administration was associated to a further impairment in renal function not attributable to rabdomyolysis.","['Adult', 'Creatinine', 'Female', 'Fenofibrate', 'Gout', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Young Adult']",24940667,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['D02.241.081.114.968.500.625', 'D02.355.726.305.625', 'D02.455.426.559.389.134.750', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.654.305.625', 'D02.522.223.750'], ['C05.550.114.423', 'C05.550.354.500', 'C05.799.414', 'C16.320.565.798.368', 'C18.452.648.798.368'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452.584.500.500.851'], ['C23.550.449'], ['A05.810.453'], ['C12.777.419', 'C13.351.968.419'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.760.952', 'N02.421.585.952'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
26687,"HY5, Circadian Clock-Associated 1, and a cis-element, DET1 dark response element, mediate DET1 regulation of chlorophyll a/b-binding protein 2 expression.","DET1 is a pleiotropic regulator of Arabidopsis development and controls the expression of many light-regulated genes. To gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which DET1 controls transcription from light-regulated promoters, we identified elements in the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein 2 (CAB2) promoter that are required for DET1-mediated expression. Using a series of reporter constructs in which the luciferase gene is controlled by CAB2 promoter fragments, we defined two DET1-responsive elements in the CAB2 promoter that are essential for proper CAB2 transcription. A 40-bp DET1 dark-response element (DtRE) is required for both dark and root-specific repression of CAB2, whereas the known CAB upstream factor-1 element is required for DET1 activation-associated effects in the light and repression in the roots. HY5, a factor that binds CAB upstream factor-1, is also required for DET1 effects in the light. DtRE binds two distinct activities in Arabidopsis seedling extracts: a novel activity with binding site CAAAACGC that we have named CAB2 DET1-associated factor 1 plus an activity that is likely to be the myb transcription factor Circadian Clock-Associated 1. Both activities are altered in dark-grown det1 extracts as compared with wild type, correlating a change in extractable DNA binding activity with a major change in CAB2 expression. We conclude that DET1 represses the CAB2 promoter in the dark by regulating the binding of two factors, CAB2 DET1-associated factor 1 and Circadian Clock-Associated 1, to the DtRE.","['Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Coleoptera', 'Darkness', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Light', 'Luciferases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors']",14563928,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.157.100'], ['D12.776.765.149'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D12.776.260.108', 'D12.776.930.127'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['G07.180.562.190'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.375'], ['G01.590.540.233'], ['G05.308.375'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.435'], ['D12.644.360', 'D12.776.476'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['D08.811.682.517', 'D12.776.532.510'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.776.660'], ['B01.650.520', 'B05.620.600'], ['E05.393.751'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Prostates from a group of younger individuals only showed a patchy distribution of the MCAR at the epithelium of the acini.

41507,A study of goat SRY protein expression suggests putative new roles for this gene in the developing testis of a species with long-lasting SRY expression.,"The testis-determining gene SRY is not well-conserved among mammals, and particularly between mouse and other mammals. To evaluate SRY function in a nonrodent species, we produced an antibody against goat SRY and used it to investigate the expression pattern of SRY throughout goat testicular development. By contrast with the mouse, SRY is primarily expressed in most cells of XY genital-ridges and not solely in pre-Sertoli cells. Between cord formation and prepuberty, SRY remains expressed in both Sertoli and germinal cells. During adulthood, SRY expression declines and then disappears from meiotic germ cells, only remaining present at low levels in some spermatogonia. Unlike the germinal lineage, SRY continues to be highly expressed in adult Sertoli cells with a typical nuclear staining. Our data indicate that in goat, the role of SRY may not be limited to testis determination and could have other functions in testicular maintenance and hence male fertility.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Goats', 'Male', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sertoli Cells', 'Sex Differentiation', 'Sex-Determining Region Y Protein', 'Spermatogonia', 'Testis']",20941779,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A11.251.210.172.500', 'A11.329.228.220'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.126.110'], ['G05.308.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.513'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['A05.360.444.849.789', 'A11.382.952', 'A11.436.837'], ['G07.345.500.325.377.843', 'G07.345.750.500', 'G08.686.841.500'], ['D12.776.260.719.049', 'D12.776.660.235.400.750.049', 'D12.776.664.235.400.750.049', 'D12.776.930.823.049'], ['A05.360.490.890.900', 'A11.497.760.800'], ['A05.360.444.849', 'A05.360.576.782', 'A06.300.312.782']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
17788,Influence of streaming potential on the transport and separation of charged spherical solutes in nanochannels subjected to particle-wall interactions.,"In this work, we theoretically investigate the implications of streaming potential on the transport and size-based separation of charged solutes in nanoscale confinements. By employing a regular perturbation analysis, we demonstrate that the consideration of streaming potential establishes a new paradigm of size-based separation of charged solutes in nanochannels. Depending on the sizes of the particles being handled, we establish two distinctive separation regimes. For smaller particles with significantly large electrophoretic mobilities, electrophoretic transport mechanisms predominantly influence the solutal transport characteristics, whereas for larger particles the combined pressure-driven and back electroosmotic transport mechanisms essentially dictate the resultant separation characteristics. The extent of improvement in separation characteristics, on account of the consideration of streaming effect, largely depends on the consideration of particle-wall interactions. For cases without wall effects, the streaming potential may induce dramatic enhancements in the resolution of separation for small particles by exploiting optimal combinations of zeta potential values and relative thicknesses of the electrical double layers. However, with wall effect considerations, similar combinations of zeta potential and electrical double-layer thicknesses may give rise to dramatic improvements in the separation characteristics over a much wider range of particle sizes by interacting nontrivially with the streaming potential effects. Such confluences may be exploited in practice for designing efficient nanofluidic separation systems.","['Adsorption', 'Electrochemistry', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Statistical', 'Nanoparticles', 'Nanotechnology', 'Osmosis', 'Particle Size', 'Pressure', 'Solutions', 'Surface Properties', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",19618905,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['H01.181.529.307'], ['E05.830.666', 'H01.671.808.500', 'J01.897.520.500.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.666.400', 'E05.595.666.400'], ['E05.599.495'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['H01.603', 'J01.897.520.600'], ['G01.154.090.750', 'G02.111.655', 'G02.691', 'G02.723.495'], ['G02.712'], ['G01.374.715'], ['D26.776'], ['G02.860'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0

14514,Recombinant interleukin-2-activated intracavitary lymphocytes: phenotypic characteristics and effector function.,"A preclinical study of intracavitary lymphocytes (ICL) from malignant effusions of cancer patients is described. The object of this study was to evaluate the antitumor potential of ICL as a baseline for developing adoptive immunotherapy trial for ovarian carcinoma patients. The main parameters studied were functional cytolytic activity of fresh and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-activated ICL and their phenotypic characteristics. Spontaneous cytolytic activity of ICL was detected in all samples tested against natural killer (NK)-sensitive targets (K562), while very low activity was shown against NK-resistant targets (Daudi) and fresh tumor cells. Activation in culture with rIL-2 generated cytolytic activity against NK-resistant targets and significantly augmented NK activity. The pattern of antitumor lytic activity of ICL resembles lymphokine-activated killer cell activity and is non-major histocompatibility complex restricted against a variety of tumor targets. Phenotypic characterization of fresh ICL showed the predominance of CD3+ cells with the CD4/CD8 ratio resembling that of peripheral blood lymphocytes. During culture with rIL-2, changes in phenotypic expression of activated ICL were detected: enrichment in NKH1+ cells (up to 65%), of CD8+ (up to 70%), and very late antigen (VLA)-1+ cells (up to 54%), concomitantly with a decrease in CD4+ population. The NKH1, CD8, and VLA-1 expression peaked at 2 weeks in culture and coincided with peak cytolytic activity of cultured ICL. Depletion of CD8+ cells from activated ICL resulted in a decreased proportion of cells expressing the NKH1 and VLA-1 phenotype, whereas depletion CD4+ cells led to enrichment in CD8, NKH1, and VLA-1 antigens. Cytolytic activity was significantly increased in CD4 depleted population against NK-resistant and NK-sensitive targets. In this study we found that rIL-2 activation and culture of ICL generates killer activity against NK-resistant and fresh tumor targets and that enrichment in expression of NKH1, CD8, and VLA-1 antigens is associated with effector function.","['Antigens, Surface', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Exudates and Transudates', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2787838,"[['D23.050.301'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['A11.251'], ['G12.287'], ['A12.383'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.021', 'D12.644.276.374.480.372', 'D12.776.467.374.465.021', 'D12.776.467.374.480.372', 'D23.529.374.465.155', 'D23.529.374.480.372'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['G05.695'], ['D12.776.828']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4312,The Parental Schoolwork Support Measure-Youth: development and psychometric evaluation.,"Parental involvement in school-related tasks is associated with a number of positive outcomes across ethnic groups. However, a growing literature suggests that unique forms of involvement and barriers exist among linguistic minority Latino families. The Parental Schoolwork Support Measure-Youth (PSSM-Y) is introduced in this study along with the psychometric properties found with a sample of 133 Latino youth in Grades 5 through 7 from a public school in a low-income urban neighborhood. Exploratory factor analyses indicated the presence of three factors called direct support, language and support, and indirect support, which together accounted for 66.3% of the common variance in the 16-item version. Strong internal consistency and test-retest coefficients were found for the PSSM-Y in this sample. In addition, schoolwork support was correlated with youth depression, economic pressure, loneliness, and familism in the expected directions. The findings are discussed in terms of the potential utility of this measure for future school-based studies of Latino students and youth of immigrant backgrounds in the United States.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Poverty Areas', 'Psychometrics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Schools', 'Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Students', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States', 'Urban Population']",22686144,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E05.318.740.400', 'N05.715.360.750.350', 'N06.850.520.830.400'], ['M01.686.754.441'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.263.370.290'], ['F01.829.263.500.320', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340', 'M01.620'], ['I01.880.853.996.535.550', 'N01.824.600.550'], ['F04.711.780'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['N01.224.791', 'N06.850.505.400.800'], ['I02.783', 'J03.832'], ['I01.880.853.500.600'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['M01.848'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['N01.600.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

We present the Mars-500 experiment, which took place in Moscow, Russia, over 520 d from June 5, 2010, to November 4, 2011. It was designed to simulate a 250-d interplanetary mission from Earth to Mars, a 30-d orbital stay with a Mars landing, and a 240-d interplanetary mission from Mars back to Earth. The six-person crew was composed of three Russians, two Europeans, and one Chinese.METHODS: We applied the ethological method based on observation, description, and quantification of nonverbal behavior expressed by actions and interactions, as well as verbal behavior expressed through positions and communications. These events were scored with The Observer XT software from video recordings made every 2 wk during a daily life activity at breakfast time and every month during a group discussion task.RESULTS: We show that the frequency of occurrences of personal actions, visual interactions, facial expressions and collateral acts are linked to certain phases, periods, and temporal points of the mission. Verbal communications in English and in Russian involve prevalent language associated with place preferences and preferential relationships among the crewmembers.DISCUSSION: We found evidence that the Mars-500 crew behavior was dependent on time, culture, and the individual.","['Adult', 'Communication', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Culture', 'Ecological Systems, Closed', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Russia', 'Space Flight']",24261062,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.145.209', 'L01.143'], ['I01.076.201.450.281', 'I01.880.853.100.257'], ['I01.076.201.450', 'I01.880.853.100'], ['G16.500.275.157.240', 'N06.230.124.240', 'N06.230.150.225'], ['E05.318.740.400', 'N05.715.360.750.350', 'N06.850.520.830.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.122.500', 'Z01.542.248.775'], ['J01.937.285.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
1284,A case-management program of medium intensity does not improve cardiovascular risk factor control in coronary artery disease patients: the Heartcare I trial.,"BACKGROUND: Case-management programs for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease that utilize extensive resources can reduce cardiovascular risk factors, but less intensive approaches have failed to show benefits. This randomized trial evaluated whether a medium intensity case-management program improves risk factor control in patients with coronary artery disease.METHODS: We assigned 201 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute coronary events in the intensive care unit of University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, to either a risk factor case-management program (n = 99) or care as usual (n = 102) using the patients' primary care physicians as the unit of randomization (cluster randomization). The case-management program consisted of an hour of counseling by a clinician during hospitalization and two short reminders by phone and mail 3 and 6 months later. Treatment decisions were left to patients and their primary care physicians.RESULTS: After 9 and 18 months of follow-up, there were no significant differences in lipid values, blood pressure control, fasting blood glucose, body-mass index, or number of smokers between the two groups. However, significantly more patients in the intervention group than in the care as usual group achieved target cholesterol values after 18 months (48% versus 27%, P = 0.002 and remained significant after Bonferroni-Holms correction) but not after 9 months of follow-up (31% versus 27%, P >0.2).CONCLUSION: This hospital-based case-management and outreach program, limited to counseling by a clinician, did not substantially improve cardiovascular risk factor control among patients hospitalized for coronary events.","['Blood Pressure', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case Management', 'Cholesterol', 'Coronary Disease', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Risk Factors']",11343668,"[['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['N04.590.233.624.250'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197', 'D10.570.938.208'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.458'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
27242,Isolated tibial polyethylene insert exchange outcomes after total knee arthroplasty.,"UNLABELLED: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a modular design allows isolated tibial polyethylene insert exchange (ITPIE) as a treatment option for isolated polyethylene failure. We asked whether ITPIE in selected patients would provide high survivorship and identified factors predicting success or failure. We retrospectively reviewed 42 patients (42 knees) who underwent ITPIE for instability, stiffness, or aseptic effusions after TKA. All patients had well-aligned and well-fixed components documented by radiographs and intraoperative evaluation. We determined whether patients had been revised and evaluated unrevised patients using the Knee Society rating system. The minimum followup was 2 years (average, 5.6 years; range, 2-11 years). Twelve patients (29%) underwent subsequent revision of their ITPIE (58% survivorship at 11 years). Average time to revision was 3 years. Although mean Knee Society scores improved, nine of the 30 unrevised patients (30%) had persistent pain at followup. Time from index TKA to ITPIE was associated with outcome; ITPIE less than 3 years from index TKA was 3.8 times more likely to undergo rerevision than ITPIE more than 3 years from index TKA. ITPIE for failed TKA is associated with unpredictable outcomes. ITPIE, even with well-defined and narrow indications, should be undertaken with caution. The longer the initial components performed successfully before ITPIE, the greater the likelihood of success after ITPIE.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

19364,Utilization of fermented barley extract obtained from a by-product of barley shochu for nisin production.,"Fermented barley extract (FBE) obtained from a barley shochu by-product (shochu kasu) and its ethanol fractions were evaluated as a medium and supplement, respectively, for nisin A production by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454. A Brix 2.5 FBE medium supplemented with glucose provided a high level of nisin A production with a nisin yield comparable to that from a nutritionally rich laboratory medium (basal medium). By adding the ethanol-insoluble (EI) fraction of FBE to the basal medium, nisin A production was enhanced concomitant with an increase in bacterial cell growth, while the ethanol-soluble (ES) fraction had a negative effect on nisin A production. These findings indicate that FBE obtained from shochu kasu can be utilized as a preferable medium for nisin A production and could be converted into a value-added food product having preservative functions. The procedure developed in this study would promote recycling of shochu kasu.","['Bioreactors', 'Culture Media', 'Ethanol', 'Fermentation', 'Glucose', 'Hordeum', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactates', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lactococcus lactis', 'Nisin', 'Solubility', 'Temperature']",19000617,"[['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['D02.033.375'], ['G02.111.158.249', 'G03.191.249'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.481'], ['G02.300'], ['D02.241.511.459'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['B03.353.750.737.500.400', 'B03.510.400.800.500.400', 'B03.510.550.737.500.400'], ['D04.345.566.582', 'D12.644.641.582', 'D12.776.097.151.700', 'D12.776.543.695.110.700'], ['G02.805'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
7651,Risk indicators for tooth wear in Sri Lankan adolescents.,"The aim of the study was to determine the risk indicators for tooth wear in Sri Lankan adolescents. A total of 1,200 17-year-olds were selected using a two-stage cluster sampling technique from schools in the Colombo district. The data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire and a clinical examination. A modified version of Smith and Knight's index of tooth wear was used to record tooth wear on occlusal/incisal, buccal and lingual/palatal surfaces of teeth excluding the third molars. Tooth wear was present in 22% of the adolescents, while nearly 9% had at least 1 wear lesion extending up to the dentine. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the consumption of Coca Cola(R) (OR: 2.60; 95% CI: 1.41-4.78), apples (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.04-2.58), the father's occupation (OR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.29-3.74) and chewing vitamin C tablets (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.03-2.75) were significantly associated with dentinal wear, while tooth wear was associated with the consumption of oranges (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.09-2.37) and apples (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.06-1.80), the father's occupation (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.22-2.68) and chewing vitamin C tablets (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.04-2.00). As the father's occupation could be considered as a proxy measure of socioeconomic status, the findings suggest that tooth wear in Sri Lankan adolescents is a disorder of affluence.","['Adolescent', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Carbonated Beverages', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Dentin', 'Fathers', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Malus', 'Occupations', 'Oral Hygiene', 'Physical Examination', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Class', 'Sri Lanka', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tooth Wear', 'Toothbrushing', 'Vitamins']",20068303,"[['M01.060.057'], ['D02.241.081.844.107', 'D02.241.511.902.107', 'D09.811.100'], ['G07.203.100.300', 'J02.200.300'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.875.177.769'], ['A14.549.167.900.280'], ['F01.829.263.500.320.100', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340.210', 'M01.620.390'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.444'], ['N01.824.547'], ['E02.547.600', 'E06.761.726'], ['E01.370.600'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['I01.880.853.996.755', 'N01.824.782'], ['Z01.252.245.840', 'Z01.639.520.875'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['C07.793.818'], ['E06.761.726.794'], ['D27.505.696.494.600', 'G07.203.300.681.500.600', 'J02.500.681.500.600']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
39917,Multiple-center study of reduced-concentration triamcinolone topical solution for the treatment of dogs with known or suspected allergic pruritus.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of triamcinolone acetonide topical solution (TTS) in dogs for use in reduction of clinical signs of pruritic inflammatory skin diseases of a known or suspected allergic basis and to evaluate adverse effects associated with TTS administration.ANIMALS: 103 pruritic adult dogs with known or suspected allergic skin disease.PROCEDURE: Dogs were treated for 4 weeks with TTS or with vehicle solution (control dogs) in a multiple-center study. Clinical signs were scored by owners and by examining veterinarians before and after treatment. Blood samples obtained before and after treatment were subjected to routine hematologic and serum biochemical analyses.RESULTS: Treatment success, as defined by an improvement of at least 2 of 6 grades in overall clinical score, was evident in 35 of 52 (67%) TTS-treated dogs (mean improvement, 1.98) and 12 of 51 (24%) control dogs (mean improvement, 0.29). For several criteria, TTS was significantly more effective than vehicle in reducing clinical signs. Minor alterations in hematologic determinations in TTS-treated dogs were limited to slightly lower total leukocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts after treatment. Minor adverse effects were reported by owners in 6 of 52 (12%) TTS-treated and 9 of 51 (18%) control dogs.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Triamcinolone used as a spray solution at a concentration approximately one-sixth the concentration of triamcinolone topical preparations currently available for veterinary use is effective for short-term alleviation of allergic pruritus in dogs. Adverse effects are few and mild and, thus, do not preclude prolonged treatment with the solution.","['Administration, Topical', 'Animals', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Pruritus', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide']",11911576,"[['E02.319.267.120'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.124.100', 'E05.200.124.100'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['D06.472.040.543', 'D27.505.696.399.472.488'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595', 'E05.200.625.107.595', 'E05.242.195.107.595', 'G04.140.107.595', 'G09.188.105.595'], ['C17.800.685', 'C23.888.885.625'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.915.715', 'D04.210.500.908.891.927']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
28504,VA Study of Unstable Angina. 10-year results show duration of surgical advantage for patients with impaired ejection fraction.,"BACKGROUND: In a randomized study of unstable angina, medically treated patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) ejection fractions (EF = 0.3 to 0.58) were at significantly higher risk of mortality than patients treated by coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Because the duration of this surgical advantage is unknown, 10-year cumulative mortality rates of patients with impaired LVEF were determined and compared with the previously observed rates at 2, 5, and 8 years.METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 468 patients with unstable angina, 237 were randomized to receive medical treatment alone and 231 patients to have CABG. Baseline characteristics, which were equally distributed between the two treatment groups, included age, LVEF, number of diseased coronary arteries, diabetes, clinical presentation (type I or type II), prior myocardial infarction, and smoking. Mortality was determined by life-table analysis and risk factors by logistic regression analysis. Patients were divided into terciles according to LVEF, and the mortality rates of medical and surgical patients in the lowest tercile were compared. The 10-year mortality rate for all medical patients was 38% and for all surgical patients, 39%. When LVEF was treated as a continuous variable, there was a significant relation between mortality and LVEF for medically treated patients but not for surgical patients. The cumulative mortality rate for the lowest-tercile (EF 0.3 to 0.58) medical patients was 49%; for the lowest-tercile surgical patients, 41% (P = .15).CONCLUSIONS: The surgical advantage for patients with impaired LVEF that was significant at 5 years (P = .03) and 8 years (P = .05) appears to have diminished at 10 years (P = .15).","['Angina, Unstable', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Stroke Volume', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left']",7955237,"[['C14.280.647.187.150', 'C14.907.585.187.150', 'C23.888.592.612.233.500.150'], ['E04.100.376.719.332', 'E04.100.814.868.750', 'E04.928.220.520.220'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.475', 'E05.318.740.100.500', 'N01.224.935.530', 'N06.850.505.400.975.475', 'N06.850.520.308.985.475'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E01.370.370.380.150.700', 'G09.330.380.124.882'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['G01.910.857'], ['C14.280.945.900']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
16404,PDGFR-â (+) perivascular cells from infantile hemangioma display the features of mesenchymal stem cells and show stronger adipogenic potential in vitro and in vivo.,"Infantile hemangioma, a common benign tumor of infancy, grows quickly in the first year of life, and then regresses slowly to fibrofatty tissue in childhood. The accumulation of fibrofatty tissue in hemangioma involution indicates adipogenesis during this period. Perivascular cells (PCs) from multiple organs display multi-lineage differentiation, including adipogenesis. So we supposed that PCs in hemangioma may contribute to the adipogenesis in the involution. In this study, PDGFR-â (+) PCs was isolated from hemangioma tissue (hemangioma-derived perivascular cells, Hem-PCs) by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. In vitro, Hem-PCs showed fibroblast-like morphology. Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry showed Hem-PCs expressed MSCs markers CD105, CD90, CD29 and vimentin, pericyte markers á-SMA and PDGFR-â, stem cell marker CD133, and the adipogenic transcription factor PPAR-ã, but not hematopoietic/endothelial markers CD45, CD34, CD31, and flt-1. In vitro inductions confirmed multi-lineage differentiation of Hem-PCs, especially strong adipogenic potential. Then a murine model was established to observe in vivo differentiation of Hem-PCs by subcutaneous injection of cells/Matrigel compound into nude mice. The results showed Hem-PCs differentiated into adipocytes in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the isolation of multipotential PDGFR-â (+) PCs from hemangioma, and observing their adipogenic differentiation in vivo. PCs may be the cellular basis of adipogenesis in hemangioma involution, and may be the target cells of adipogenic induction to promote hemangioma involution.","['Adipogenesis', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hemangioma', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multipotent Stem Cells', 'Pericytes', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",25031705,"[['G04.152.149'], ['B01.050'], ['G04.152'], ['G04.172', 'G07.345.500.325.180.500', 'G08.686.155', 'G08.686.784.170.104.249'], ['E01.370.225.500.363', 'E05.200.500.363', 'E05.242.363'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512.240', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512.240', 'E05.200.500.607.512.240', 'E05.200.750.551.512.240', 'E05.478.583.375'], ['C04.557.645.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['A11.329.830.500', 'A11.872.590.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['A11.872.590'], ['A07.015.700.750', 'A10.272.491.677', 'A11.710', 'A16.504.660.600'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.900.750', 'D12.776.543.750.630.625.400', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.630.400'], ['E05.393.620.500.725']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5778,Short-term effects of minimally invasive dynamic neutralization system for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis: An observational study.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and short-term effects of dynamic stabilization via minimally invasive system for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. Patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis and treated with Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion via minimally invasive minimally system (mis-TLIF) were served as the control group.From April 2011 to March 2015, 47 patients (29 male, 18 female; mean age 47.6 [range, 26-52] years) with lumbar spinal stenosis were treated with decompression and excision of herniated disk via the minimally invasive system combined with the dynamic fixation technique, and 42 patients as control group with mis-TLIF. Minimally invasive surgeries were performed via the posterior incision approach. The clinical outcomes were evaluated by comparing the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and the ROMs of the adjacent segment before and after surgery. The postoperative complications related to the implants were identified.A total of 83 patients (43 of Dynesys group and 40 of mis-TLIF group) were followed for an average duration of >35 months. Dynesys stabilization resulted in significantly higher preservation of motion at the index level (P < .05), and significantly less hypermobility at the adjacent segments. VAS for the back and leg pain and ODI improved significantly (P < .05) in 2 groups; however, there is no significant difference between the groups. In Dynesys group, 3 cases suffered skin flay necrosis, 1 of them had a wound infection that was treated with washing and drainage combined with antibiotic therapy. Skin flay necrosis were also observed in 2 cases of mis-TLIF group. Reoperation was performed in one case of Dynesys group for rupture of the internal fixation. No rupture of internal fixation was observed in mis-TLIF group.The nonfusion fixation system Dynesys may be used to treat degenerative spinal stenosis without posterior element damage. This surgical technique is safe and effective. However, utilizing higher preservation of motion may lead to the failure of internal fixation.","['Adult', 'Decompression, Surgical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internal Fixators', 'Intervertebral Disc Displacement', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Range of Motion, Articular', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Spinal Stenosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",29851799,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E04.188'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E07.695.370', 'E07.858.442.660.460', 'E07.858.690.725.460'], ['C05.116.900.307', 'C23.300.707.952'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.502'], ['E01.370.600.700', 'G11.427.760'], ['E04.555.100.700'], ['C05.116.900.825'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
45563,Fecal incontinence treated by sacral neuromodulation: Long-term follow-up of 325 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Long-term results of large patient cohorts with fecal incontinence treated by sacral neuromodulation are limited. This study shows the long-term results after a mean follow-up of 7.1 years in 325 patients with fecal incontinence treated by continuous sacral neuromodulation.METHODS: All patients with fecal incontinence and eligible for sacral neuromodulation between 2000 and 2015 were evaluated retrospectively. Primary outcome was a decrease in episodes of fecal incontinence, which was defined as involuntary fecal loss at least once per week and documented by a 3 week bowel habit diary. Quality of life was assessed using the Short-Form 36 and the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Score.RESULTS: In the study, 374 patients were included for sacral neuromodulation screening and 325 patients (32 male, 9.7%) received permanent, continuous sacral neuromodulation. Mean age was 56.5 years (17-82 years) and mean follow-up was 7.1 years (3.0-183.4 months). In the 325 patients with permanent sacral neuromodulation, fecal incontinence episodes decreased from a mean of 16.1 ± 14.5 to 3.0 ± 3.7 per 3-week period after sacral neuromodulation (P < .001) according to the bowel habit diary. Sacral neuromodulation was removed due to unsatisfactory results in 81 patients. Quality of life (both Short-Form 36 and Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Score) showed no significant difference compared with the Dutch population during follow-up.CONCLUSION: Long-term efficacy of sacral neuromodulation can be maintained in about half (52.7%) of all patients screened with sacral neuromodulation for fecal incontinence after a mean follow-up of 7.1 years. Importantly, the quality of life of patients with sacral neuromodulation for fecal incontinence did not differ from the general population.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anal Canal', 'Cohort Studies', 'Electric Stimulation Therapy', 'Fecal Incontinence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lumbosacral Plexus', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Quality of Life', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sacrum', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Treatment Outcome']",28159117,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['A03.556.124.526.070', 'A03.556.249.249.070'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E02.331', 'E02.779.468', 'E02.831.535.468'], ['C06.405.469.860.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A08.800.800.720.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['A02.835.232.834.717'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

It was also studied whether this proportion differed on farms which imported pigs from Great Britain and farms which did not do so; the proportion of carriers on farms having animals imported from Great Britain was found to be higher than that on farms not using these importations, viz., 17 per cent and one per cent respectively.","['Animals', 'Carrier State', 'Netherlands', 'Streptococcus', 'Swine', 'United Kingdom']",3603534,"[['B01.050'], ['N06.850.520.169'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['B03.353.750.737.872', 'B03.510.400.800.872', 'B03.510.550.737.872'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
43419,Efficacy of oral administration and oral intake of edible vaccines.,"To evaluate whether vaccine administration via intragastric gavage is indicative for the outcome of edible vaccines, mice were orally immunised with ovalbumin (OVA) mixed with or without Vibrio cholerae toxin (CT) in various compositions via various routes: (1) OVA dissolved in saline and intragastrically (IG) administered ('IG'); (2) OVA mixed with food extract and administered IG ('food IG'); (3) food chow absorbed with OVA dissolved in saline and fed to the animals ('food'); and (4) OVA dissolved in saline and administered via drinking bottles ('drinking'). When given to naive mice, 'IG' and 'food IG' but not 'food' or 'drinking' induced anti-OVA IgG1 responses in serum, but oral boost immunisations were necessary. Serum IgA was not induced. Oral boosting of subcutaneously (SC) primed mice enhanced the IgG1 and IgA response in serum regardless of the route of immunisation or the vaccine composition. CT did not dramatically enhance the immune response. All immunisation routes except 'drinking' induced antigen-specific IgA antibody secreting cells (ASC) in the lamina propria of naive mice. But antigen-specific antibody responses in faeces were not observed. We concluded that oral (i.e. IG) administration is distinct from oral intake. The composition of the vaccine (food or saline) did not influence oral administration. We thus suggested that the route of administration greatly influenced the outcome of oral immunisation. Although oral administration is a well-accepted route to test the potentials of oral vaccines, our study demonstrated that it is merely indicative for the effectiveness of edible vaccines. Studies on the feasibility of edible vaccines should thus be performed by eating the vaccine.","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial', 'Antibody-Producing Cells', 'Drinking', 'Enterotoxins', 'Female', 'Food', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Mice', 'Ovalbumin', 'Vaccines, Edible']",12413735,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.107', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.125', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.125'], ['A11.063', 'A15.382.032'], ['G07.203.650.283.249', 'G10.261.330.249'], ['D23.946.330'], ['G07.203.300', 'J02.500'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.026', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.026', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.026'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.644.861.557', 'D12.776.034.614', 'D12.776.256.159.157.663', 'D12.776.290.663', 'D12.776.872.557'], ['D12.776.828.868.915', 'D20.215.894.860.915', 'D20.215.894.865.915', 'D23.050.865.915']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
37373,Gingival recession treatment with connective tissue grafts in smokers and non-smokers.,"BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking can adversely affect the results of many periodontal procedures. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cigarette smoking affects wound healing of subepithelial connective tissue grafts.METHODS: Seventeen systemically healthy patients with 22 Miller Class I or II mucogingival defects were divided into a non-smoker group or smoker group. Patients were regarded as smokers if they reported smoking 10 to 20 cigarettes per day. The following parameters were documented at the surgery date and 3 and 6 months postoperatively: recession depth (RD), recession width (RW), keratinized gingiva height measured apico-coronally (KG), relative attachment level (RAL), probing depths (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and the full-mouth plaque score (FMP). Salivary cotinine samples were taken at the surgery to confirm the smoking history and to quantify cigarette use.RESULTS: Non-smokers (0- to 10-ng/ml cotinine level) healed with statistically more recession coverage than the smokers (>10-ng/ml cotinine level) (98.3% versus 82.3%, respectively; P=0.001). Six months postoperatively, the non-smokers healed with a 0.2-mm mean recession depth compared to a 1.0-mm mean recession depth for the smokers. This difference in recession depth was statistically significant (P=0.014).CONCLUSIONS: Root coverage with connective tissue grafts appears to be negatively associated with cigarette smoking. Smokers should consider smoking cessation or reducing the use of cigarettes for optimal results with connective tissue grafts.","['Adult', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cotinine', 'Female', 'Gingiva', 'Gingival Recession', 'Gingivoplasty', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Periodontal Index', 'Prospective Studies', 'Saliva', 'Smoking', 'Wound Healing']",16805676,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A10.165'], ['D03.383.773.812.180'], ['A14.549.167.646.480'], ['C07.465.714.258.447', 'C07.465.714.354.625'], ['E04.545.355', 'E06.645.355', 'E06.721.384'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.300.725', 'E06.208.720', 'E06.721.658', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.300.690', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.300.725', 'N06.890.160.215'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['A12.200.666'], ['F01.145.805'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
38806,"Hydrogeochemical characterization of fluoride rich groundwater of Wailpalli watershed, Nalgonda District, Andhra Pradesh, India.","The groundwater of Nalgonda district is well known for its very high fluoride content for the past five decades. Many researchers have contributed their scientific knowledge to unravel causes for fluoride enrichment of groundwater. In the present paper, an attempt has been made to relate the high fluoride content in the groundwater to hydrogeochemical characterization of the water in a fracture hard rock terrain--the Wailpally watershed. Groundwater samples collected from all the major geomorphic units in pre- and post-monsoon seasons were analyzed for its major ion constituents such as Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Na(+), K(+), CO3-, HCO3-, Cl(-), SO4(-2), NO3-, and F(-). The groundwaters in the watershed have the average fluoride content of 2.79 mg/l in pre-monsoon and 2.83 mg/l in post-monsoon. Fluoride concentration in groundwater does not show perceptible change neither with time nor in space. The ionic dominance pattern is in the order of Na(+) > Ca(2+) > Mg(2+) > K(-) among cations and HCO3- Cl(-) > SO4(-2) NO3- F(-) among anions in pre-monsoon. In post-monsoon, Mg replaces Ca(2+) and NO3- takes the place of SO4(-2). The Modified Piper diagram reflect that the water belong to Ca(+2)-Mg(+2)-HCO3- to Na(+)-HCO3- facies. Negative chloralkali indices in both the seasons prove that ion exchange between Na(+) and K(+) in aquatic solution took place with Ca(+2) and Mg(+2) of host rock. The interpretation of plots for different major ions and molar ratios suggest that weathering of silicate rocks and water-rock interaction is responsible for major ion chemistry of groundwater in Wailpally watershed. Chemical characteristics and evolution of this fluoride-contaminated groundwater is akin to normal waters of other hard rock terrain; hence, it can be concluded that aquifer material play an important role in the contribution of fluoride in to the accompanying water. High fluoride content in groundwater can be attributed to the continuous water-rock interaction during the process of percolation with fluoride-bearing country rocks under arid, low precipitation, and high evapotranspiration conditions.","['Calcium', 'Cyclonic Storms', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Fluorides', 'Fresh Water', 'Geology', 'Humans', 'India', 'Magnesium', 'Seasons', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Water Supply']",20069449,"[['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['G16.500.175.500', 'N06.230.100.230.100'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['D01.248.497.158.380', 'D01.303.350.300'], ['G16.500.275.280', 'N06.230.232'], ['H01.277.562'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['G01.910.645.661', 'G16.500.275.071.590', 'N06.230.300.100.250.525'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['J01.293.821.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1
4288,Phase II trial of oxaliplatin and tegafur/uracil and oral folinic acid for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer in elderly patients.,"OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer is usually diagnosed in elderly patients. Since there is clear evidence that such patients are under-treated and under-represented or even excluded from clinical studies and there are no reliable and prospective data on the feasibility and efficacy of an oxaliplatin (L-OHP)-based chemotherapy in this setting, we have tested the L-OHP plus oral uracil/tegafur (UFT) and oral folinic acid (FA) combination as first-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) aged 70 or older.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients with advanced or MCRC, aged over 70, were treated with L-OHP 65 mg/m(2) as an intravenous 3-hour infusion on day 1 and 8 plus UFT 300 mg/m(2) and FA 90 mg in 3 divided doses given orally on days 1-14 for each 3-week cycle. Patients were followed by a geriatric and a quality of life (QoL) assessment with specific scales and EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire.RESULTS: All patients were assessable for toxicity and 45 for response to treatment. Complete response was achieved in 2 patients (4%) and partial response in 22 (47%) [overall response rate, 51%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 40.7-61.2%]; 18 patients (38%) had stable disease, and 5 (11%) had disease progression. The median duration of response was 8 months (range, 3-19+ months). After a minimum follow-up of 17 months, the median time to disease progression and the median overall survival were 8.0 (95% CI: 6.7-9.3%) and 14.1 (95% CI: 11.0-17.1%) months, respectively. Regimen safety was manageable. Most adverse events were mild to moderate, and this did not result in QoL impairment. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (17%), neutro- and thrombocytopenia (2%), laryngeal spasm (2%), and peripheral neuropathy (12.7%). No treatment-related deaths occurred.CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed that this tested chemotherapy combination is active with acceptable tolerability and QoL maintenance in elderly patients with advanced or MCRC.","['Administration, Oral', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leucovorin', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organoplatinum Compounds', 'Oxaliplatin', 'Tegafur', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uracil']",16118508,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.082.500', 'E02.319.267.510.590'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.400.800.350.450', 'D08.211.840.300.500'], ['C04.697.650', 'C23.550.727.650'], ['D02.691.788'], ['D02.257.750'], ['D03.383.742.698.875.404.850'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D03.383.742.698.875']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
47068,The development of verbal and visual working memory processes: a latent variable approach.,"Working memory (WM) processing in children has been studied with different approaches, focusing on either the organizational structure of WM processing during development (factor analytic) or the influence of different task conditions on WM processing (experimental). The current study combined both approaches, aiming to distinguish verbal and visual processing in order to investigate WM development. We investigated recall performance under different task conditions in a sample of 5- to 13-year-olds, applying latent class regression analysis. In this analysis, we examined latent classes (subgroups) within the sample that differed in terms of processing type. The interpretations of the latent classes were validated internally using characteristics of the latent classes and externally using recall performance of words and figures. The results showed that children of different developmental stages used the same type of processing under the same conditions. However, due to developmental differences, their overall performances differed, showing groups of children who were successful in verbal or visual processing and groups of children who were not. This study shows and discusses the importance of disentangling the influence of task conditions from the influence of WM development when interpreting recall performance in children.","['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory, Short-Term', 'Mental Recall', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Speech', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual Perception']",22093922,"[['M01.060.057'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.525.200', 'G07.345.374.750'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425.540.407'], ['F02.463.425.540.641'], ['E05.723.729'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['F01.145.209.908.677', 'G11.561.812', 'L01.559.423.676'], ['F01.145.209.908'], ['F02.463.593.932']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
21887,Retnla overexpression attenuates allergic inflammation of the airway.,"Resistin-like molecule alpha (Retnla), also known as 'Found in inflammatory zone 1', is a secreted protein that has been found in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic mice and plays a role as a regulator of T helper (Th)2-driven inflammation. However, the role of Retnla in the progress of Th2-driven airway inflammation is not yet clear. To better understand the function of Retnla in Th2-driven airway inflammation, we generated Retnla-overexpressing (Retnla-Tg) mice. Retnla-Tg mice showed increased expression of Retnla protein in BAL fluid and airway epithelial cells. Retnla overexpression itself did not induce any alteration in lung histology or lung function compared to non-Tg controls. However, OVA-sensitized/challenged Retnla-Tg mice had decreased numbers of cells in BAL and inflammatory cells accumulating in the lung. They also showed a reduction in mucus production in the airway epithelium, concomitant with a decreased Muc5ac level. These results were accompanied by reduced levels of Th2 cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, with no effect on levels of OVA-specific immunoglobulin isotypes. Furthermore, phosphorylation of ERK was markedly reduced in the lungs of OVA-challenged Retnla-Tg mice. Taken together, these results indicates that Retnla protects against Th2-mediated inflammation in an experimental mouse model of asthma, suggesting that therapeutic approaches to enhance the production of Retnla or Retnla-like molecules could be valuable for preventing allergic lung inflammation.","['Animals', 'Asthma', 'Base Sequence', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",25415454,"[['B01.050'], ['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.927.100.500'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['C20.543'], ['D12.644.276', 'D12.776.467', 'D23.529'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['E05.393.620.500.706']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
30415,Supplementation of zinc mitigates the altered uptake and turnover of 65Zn in liver and whole body of diabetic rats.,"Diabetes is a life threatening disease and its onset is linked with both environmental and genetic factors. Zinc metabolism gets altered during diabetes and results in many complications. The present study was designed to elucidate the effects of zinc supplementation on the biokinetics of (65)Zn in whole body, liver and its biodistribution in diabetic rats. The animals were divided into four groups viz; normal control; diabetic (single intraperitoneal injection of alloxan 150 mg/kg body weight); zinc treated (227 mg/l in drinking water); and diabetic + zinc treated. To carry out biokinetics study, each rat was injected intraperitoneally with 0.74 MBq radioactivity of (65)Zn following 4 weeks of different treatments and the radioactivity was determined by using a suitably shielded scintillation counter. Alloxan induced diabetic rats showed a significant decrease in both the fast (Tb(1)) and slow (Tb(2)) components of biological half-life of (65)Zn which, however, were normalized in whole body (P > 0.05) following zinc supplementation. In case of liver, Tb(2) component was brought back to the normal but Tb(1) component was not increased significantly. The present study indicates that the paucity of zinc in the tissues of the diabetic animals was due to decreased retention of tissue zinc as evidenced by increased serum Zn, hyperzincuria and increased rate of uptake of (65)Zn by the liver. Zinc supplementation caused a significant improvement in the retention of zinc in the tissues and is therefore likely to be of benefit in the treatment of diabetes.","['Animals', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Zinc', 'Zinc Radioisotopes']",21584710,"[['B01.050'], ['C18.452.394.750.074', 'C19.246.240', 'E05.598.500.374'], ['G07.203.300.456', 'J02.500.456'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.620'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949'], ['D01.268.556.940', 'D01.268.956.906', 'D01.552.544.940'], ['D01.268.556.940.500.800', 'D01.268.956.906.500.800', 'D01.496.749.980', 'D01.496.966.800', 'D01.552.544.940.500.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
36286,Factor analysis of household factors: are they associated with respiratory conditions in Chinese children?,"BACKGROUND: We explored methods to develop uncorrelated variables for epidemiological analysis models. They were used to examine associations between respiratory health outcomes and multiple household risk factors.METHODS: We analysed data collected in the Four Chinese Cities Study (FCCS) to examine health effects on prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms and illnesses in 7058 school children living in the four Chinese cities: Lanzhou, Chongqing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. We used factor analysis approaches to reduce the number of the children's lifestyle/household variables and to develop new uncorrelated 'factor' variables. We used unconditional logistic regression models to examine associations between the factor variables and the respiratory health outcomes, while controlling for other covariates.RESULTS: Five factor variables were derived from 21 original variables: heating coal smoke, cooking coal smoke, socioeconomic status, ventilation, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and parental asthma. We found that higher exposure to heating coal smoke was associated with higher reporting of cough with phlegm, wheeze, and asthma. Cooking coal smoke was not associated with any of the outcomes. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with lower reporting of persistent cough and bronchitis. Higher household ventilation was associated with lower reporting of persistent cough, persistent phlegm, cough with phlegm, bronchitis, and wheeze. Higher exposure to ETS and the presence of parental asthma were associated with higher reporting of persistent cough, persistent phlegm, cough with phlegm, bronchitis, wheeze, and asthma.CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that independent respiratory effects of exposure to indoor air pollution, heating coal smoke, and ETS may exist for the studied children.","['Air Pollution, Indoor', 'Asthma', 'Bronchitis', 'Child', 'China', 'Coal', 'Cough', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Heating', 'Humans', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoke', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution', 'Ventilation']",15166210,"[['N06.850.460.100.080'], ['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['C01.748.099', 'C08.127.446', 'C08.381.495.146', 'C08.730.099'], ['M01.060.406'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['D20.345.108', 'N06.230.132.258.108'], ['C08.618.248', 'C23.888.852.293'], ['E05.318.740.400', 'N05.715.360.750.350', 'N06.850.520.830.400'], ['N06.230.150.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.852.779', 'E01.370.386.720', 'G09.772.775'], ['C08'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['D20.633.937'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['D20.633.937.680', 'N06.850.460.100.555'], ['N06.230.150.520']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
2987,Using polymer chemistry to modulate the delivery of neurotrophic factors from degradable microspheres: delivery of BDNF.,"PURPOSE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neuroprotection and repair, but long-term delivery from polymer systems has been challenging. We investigated the role the chemistry of the polymer played in loading and delivery of BDNF via microspheres, which are suitable for minimally invasive administration.METHODS: We synthesized polymers based on PLGA and PEG to determine what components augmented loading and delivery. We characterized microspheres fabricated from these polymers using a battery of tests, including sizing, in vitro release, and bioactivity of the BDNF using PC12 cells engineered to express the trkB receptor.RESULTS: We found that a triblock polymer of PLGA, PLL, and PEG led to the delivery of BDNF for periods of time greater than 60 days and that the BDNF delivered was bioactive. The microsphere size was amendable to injection via a 30 gauge needle, allowing minimally invasive delivery.CONCLUSIONS: PLGA-PLL-PEG leads to greater loading and longer-term delivery of BDNF than PLGA or a blend of the polymers. We hypothesize that the introduction of an amphiphilic PLGA-based polymer increases the interaction of the BDNF with the polymer and leads to release that more closely correlates with the degradation of the polymer.","['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Drug Carriers', 'Lactic Acid', 'Microspheres', 'Models, Chemical', 'PC12 Cells', 'Particle Size', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Polyglycolic Acid', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Polylysine', 'Polymers', 'Rats', 'Receptor, trkB', 'Solubility']",19921405,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.644.276.860.100', 'D12.776.467.860.100', 'D12.776.631.600.100', 'D23.529.850.100'], ['G04.152'], ['H01.158.703.007', 'H01.181.466'], ['D26.255.260', 'E02.319.300.380'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['E07.565'], ['E05.599.495'], ['A11.251.210.190.750', 'A11.251.860.180.750', 'A11.299.500'], ['G02.712'], ['D02.033.455.250.700', 'D05.750.741', 'D25.720.741', 'J01.637.051.720.741'], ['D05.750.728.780', 'D25.720.728.780', 'J01.637.051.720.728.780'], ['D02.241.511.459.450.500', 'D05.750.728.780.500', 'D25.720.728.780.500', 'J01.637.051.720.728.780.500'], ['D12.125.068.555.750', 'D12.125.095.647.750', 'D12.644.760'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.700', 'D12.776.543.750.630.498', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.550.600'], ['G02.805']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
17252,Validity of deterministic record linkage using multiple indirect personal identifiers: linking a large registry to claims data.,"BACKGROUND: Linking patient registries with administrative databases can enhance the utility of the databases for epidemiological and comparative effectiveness research. However, registries often lack direct personal identifiers, and the validity of record linkage using multiple indirect personal identifiers is not well understood.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a large contemporary national cardiovascular device registry and 100% Medicare inpatient data, we linked hospitalization-level records. The main outcomes were the validity measures of several deterministic linkage rules using multiple indirect personal identifiers compared with rules using both direct and indirect personal identifiers. Linkage rules using 2 or 3 indirect, patient-level identifiers (ie, date of birth, sex, admission date) and hospital ID produced linkages with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98% compared with a gold standard linkage rule using a combination of both direct and indirect identifiers.CONCLUSIONS: Ours is the first large-scale study to validate the performance of deterministic linkage rules without direct personal identifiers. When linking hospitalization-level records in the absence of direct personal identifiers, provider information is necessary for successful linkage.","['Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Claim Reporting', 'Male', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Medical Records Systems, Computerized', 'Medicare', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'United States']",24755909,"[['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.313.500.750.280', 'L01.470'], ['M01.643.470'], ['N03.219.521.576.210'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.500', 'N04.452.859.564.550', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.500', 'N06.850.520.308.940.968.500'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.625', 'L01.313.500.750.300.695', 'N04.452.859.564.650', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.530', 'N06.850.520.308.940.968.625'], ['N03.219.521.346.506.564.663', 'N03.219.521.576.343.840', 'N03.706.615.696'], ['E05.318.308.940', 'L01.399.250.900', 'N04.452.859', 'N05.715.360.300.715', 'N06.850.520.308.940'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
48812,Optical coherence tomography and focal macular electroretinogram in eyes with epiretinal membrane and macular pseudohole.,"PURPOSE: To determine the morphology of macular pseudoholes (MPHs) and the relationship of morphology to macular function.DESIGN: Observational case series.METHODS: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed on 42 eyes of 42 consecutive patients with an epiretinal membrane (ERM) and an MPH. The diameters of the MPH, and the thickness of the foveal and parafoveal retina were measured. Of these 42 eyes, focal macular electroretinograms (FMERGs) were recorded from 22 eyes of 22 patients with a 15 degree stimulus; FMERGs were also recorded with a 5 degree stimulus from 9 eyes of these 22 eyes.RESULTS: In 42 eyes, the mean +/- Standard deviation (SD) diameter (437.7 +/- 172.8 microm) and geometrical shape of the MPHs were not significantly correlated with the visual acuity. The MPHs were divided into 2 types from the OCT images at the base of MPHs; group A had normal thickness (100-199 microm; n = 29), and group B (n = 13) had thicknesses of >or= 200 microm, or thickness < 100 microm, or irregular base. The visual acuity in group A (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [log MAR] mean +/- SD:.083 +/-.144) was significantly better than group B (log MAR,.407 +/-.212, P <.0001). There was a significant reduction in the amplitude of all components of FMERGs elicited by the 15 degree stimulus in the affected eyes (mean +/- SE, A-wave: 1.26 +/-.12 microv, B-wave: 3.07 +/-.27 microv, oscillatory potentials: 1.23 +/-.25 microv) compared with the normal fellow eyes (A-wave: 1.58 +/-.13 microv, B-wave: 4.14 +/-.27 microv, oscillatory potentials: 2.35 +/-.29 microv). A significant correlation was found between the relative amplitudes of the B-wave elicited by the 5 degree stimulus and the visual acuity (r =.918, P =.0005).CONCLUSIONS: In eyes with an ERM and an MPH, the visual acuity is generally correlated with the OCT images. Macular function of eyes with an MPH resembles eyes with an ERM without an MPH. The effect of the ERM appears to be different on the base and parafovea of the MPHs.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Electroretinography', 'Epiretinal Membrane', 'Female', 'Fovea Centralis', 'Humans', 'Interferometry', 'Macula Lutea', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retinal Perforations', 'Tomography', 'Visual Acuity']",12834671,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E01.370.380.225', 'E01.370.405.270'], ['C11.768.328'], ['A09.371.729.522.436'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.490'], ['A09.371.729.522'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C11.768.740'], ['E01.370.350.825'], ['E01.370.380.850.950', 'F02.463.593.932.901', 'G14.940']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
31855,Tolerance to sulfur dioxide-induced bronchoconstriction in subjects with asthma.,"A study to determine whether the bronchoconstriction induced by low concentration of sulfur dioxide in subjects with asthma decreases with repeated exposure was undertaken. Eight subjects with asthma performed 3 min of voluntary eucapnic hyperpnea with 0.5 ppm of SO2 in humidified filtered air three times at 30-min intervals and we measured specific airway resistance (SRaw) before and after each period of hyperpnea. Specific airway resistance increased significantly more after the first exposure to SO2 [(from 7.6 +/- 1.7 to 15.5 +/- 2.0 L x cm H2O/liter/sec (mean +/- SEM)] than after the second (from 8.1 +/- 1.3 to 10.8 +/- 1.6) or third (from 7.6 +/- 1.6 to 10.1 +/- 1.9) exposures (P less than 0.025). When seven subjects repeated hyperpnea with SO2 24 hr and 7 days later, SRaw increased as much as it had after the first exposure (from 8.2 +/- 2.5 to 15.5 +/- 4.5 at 24 hr and from 6.6 +/- 1.4 to 15.4 +/- 2.1 at 7 days). In four subjects repeated exposure to SO2 caused short-term inhibition of the bronchomotor response to SO2 but did not inhibit the bronchomotor response to histamine aerosol. It was concluded that repeated exposures to a low concentration of SO2 over a short period (on 1 day) can induce tolerance to the bronchomotor effects of SO2 in subjects with asthma. Tolerance to the bronchomotor effects of SO2 is not caused by decreased responsiveness of airway smooth muscle or a generalized decrease in the responsiveness of vagal reflex pathways since the bronchomotor response to histamine is preserved.","['Adult', 'Airway Resistance', 'Asthma', 'Bronchi', 'Bronchial Provocation Tests', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Female', 'Histamine', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Sulfur Dioxide']",6832125,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.386.700.050', 'G09.772.060'], ['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['A04.411.125'], ['E01.370.386.700.125'], ['G07.690.773.992'], ['D02.092.211.215.501', 'D02.092.471.440', 'D03.383.129.308.373', 'D23.469.050.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.362.810', 'D01.650.550.850.925', 'D01.875.825.925']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
3735,Aspirin inhibits nuclear factor-kappa B mobilization and monocyte adhesion in stimulated human endothelial cells.,"BACKGROUND: The induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is mediated by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). Since salicylates have been reported to inhibit NF-kappa B activation by preventing the degradation of its inhibitor I kappa B, we studied a potential inhibition of this pathway by acetylsalicylate (aspirin) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).METHODS AND RESULTS: Gel-shift analyses demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-induced NF-kappa B mobilization by aspirin at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mmol/L. Induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin surface expression by TNF was dose-dependently reduced by aspirin over the same range, while induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was hardly affected. Aspirin appeared to prevent VCAM-1 transcription, since it dose-dependently inhibited induction of VCAM-1 mRNA by TNF. As a functional consequence, adhesion of U937 monocytes to TNF-stimulated HUVECs was markedly reduced by aspirin due to suppression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin upregulation. These effects of aspirin were not related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity, since indomethacin was ineffective.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that aspirin inhibits NF-kappa B mobilization, induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin, and subsequent monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells stimulated by TNF, thereby providing an additional mechanism for therapeutic effects of aspirin.","['Aspirin', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cells, Cultured', 'E-Selectin', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Monocytes', 'NF-kappa B', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",7534663,"[['D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595.176'], ['G04.022'], ['D12.776.395.550.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200', 'D23.050.301.350'], ['A11.251'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.700.300', 'D12.776.503.843.300', 'D12.776.543.550.200.700.300', 'D23.050.301.350.700.300'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['A11.118.637.555.652', 'A11.148.580', 'A11.627.624', 'A11.733.547', 'A15.145.229.637.555.652', 'A15.378.316.580', 'A15.382.490.555.652', 'A15.382.670.547', 'A15.382.680.547'], ['D05.500.672', 'D12.776.260.600', 'D12.776.660.600', 'D12.776.930.600'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.920', 'D12.776.543.550.200.920', 'D23.050.301.350.920']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
43915,[Anatomical basis for the newly developed facelifting].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the SMAS and the facial nerve divisions in the cheek area.METHOD: We dissected 12 cadaver heads(24 sides).RESULTS: 1. SMAS distributed over the middle face. It became thinner as it extended forward and there was a small aperture lateral to the mouth. The branches of facial nerve lay directly beneath the parotidomassetric fascia after emerging from the parotid gland. 2. The frontal branch penetrated the deep fascia to the SMAS at about 0.5 cm below the zygomatic arch. 3. Some buccal branches went through the cheek fat pad while the others lay on its surface directly under the thin SMAS. 4. There was constantly a zygomatic ramus went into the upper one third of the zygomaticus. It innervated the lower and lateral orbicularis oculi muscle in 9 of 24 sides (37.5%) of the cadaver heads, zygomaticus major and minor and orbicularis oculi muscle in 8 of 24 sides (33.3%), and the zygomaticus major and minor in 7 of 24 sides (29.2%).CONCLUSION: During facelifting, wide dissection of the SMAS should be done directly above the parotidomassetric fascia and 0.5 cm below the zygomatic arch. While approaching the middle face, the dissection should be limited to the lower two third of the zygomaticus, followed by elevating the zygomatic fat. The authors dissect the nasolabial fold through the lower eyelid incision, then the dissection should go downwards, under the orbicularis oculi muscle, to the nasolabial area. In a clinical situation, care must be taken not to damage the facial nerve trunk, and dissection of the upper one third of the zygomaticus should be avoided.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Facial Nerve', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rhytidoplasty']",11263318,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['A08.800.050.050.275', 'A08.800.050.600.149', 'A08.800.800.060.275', 'A08.800.800.120.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.218.765', 'E04.680.275.700']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
11660,"Functional properties of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase after proteolytic cleavage at Leu119-Lys120, close to the A-domain.","By measuring the phosphorylation levels of individual proteolytic fragments of SERCA1a separated by electrophoresis after their phosphorylation, we were able to study the catalytic properties of a p95C-p14N complex arising from SERCA1a cleavage by proteinase K between Leu(119) and Lys(120), in the loop linking the A-domain with the second transmembrane segment. ATP hydrolysis by the complex was very strongly inhibited, although ATP-dependent phosphorylation and the conversion of the ADP-sensitive E1P form to E2P still occurred at appreciable rates. However, the rate of subsequent dephosphorylation of E2P was inhibited to a dramatic extent, and this was also the case for the rate of ""backdoor"" formation of E2P from E2 and P(i). E2P formation from E2 at equilibrium nevertheless indicated little change in the apparent affinity for P(i) or Mg(2+), while binding of orthovanadate was weaker. The p95C-p14N complex also had a slightly reduced affinity for Ca(2+) and exhibited a reduced rate for its Ca(2+)-dependent transition from E2 to Ca(2)E1. Thus, disruption of the N-terminal link of the A-domain with the transmembrane region seems to shift the conformational equilibria of Ca(2+)-ATPase from the E1/E1P toward the E2/E2P states and to increase the activation energy for dephosphorylation of Ca(2+)-ATPase, reviving the old idea of the A-domain being a phosphatase domain as part of the transduction machinery.","['Animals', 'Calcium', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Endopeptidases', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leucine', 'Lysine', 'Models, Molecular', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",14672956,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.250', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.500', 'D12.776.157.530.813.250', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.500', 'D12.776.543.585.813.250'], ['G02.111.570.120.704', 'G02.111.570.820.709.275.750.188'], ['D08.811.277.656.300'], ['G02.380'], ['D12.125.070.637', 'D12.125.142.441'], ['D12.125.068.555', 'D12.125.095.647', 'D12.125.142.497'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.250.500', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.500.500', 'D12.776.157.530.813.250.500', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.500.500', 'D12.776.543.585.813.250.500'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
35432,Polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles: A novel drug delivery system for enhancing the activity of Psoralen against breast cancer.,"A polymer-lipid hybrid nanocarrier was developed to encapsulate psoralen (PSO) to improve its water solubility and bioavailability. The effects of PSO-loaded polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PSO-PLNs) on breast cancer MCF-7 cells were investigated. PSO-PLNs were prepared through a nanoprecipitation method and were optimized by a central composite design-response surface methodology using particle size and entrapment efficiency as indices. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy analysis confirmed the physicochemical characterizations of PSO-PLNs, which had an average size of 93.44 ± 2.39 nm and a zeta potential of -27.63 ± 0.31 mV. In vitro drug release of PSO-PLNs was evaluated using dialysis and showed a delayed release compared with free PSO. The in vivo anticancer efficiency of PSO-PLNs was appreciated using a MCF-7 breast tumor model. Administration of PSO-PLNs showed similar antitumor efficacy but lower toxicity compared with doxorubicin. Our designed nanocarriers successfully optimized the pharmacokinetics of PSO via improved systemic delivery.","['Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Liberation', 'Ficusin', 'Humans', 'Lipids', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles', 'Particle Size', 'Polymers', 'Solubility', 'Surface Properties', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",30851393,"[['B01.050'], ['G03.787.151', 'G07.690.725.129'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['E02.319.300'], ['G02.211', 'G03.787.321', 'G07.690.725.321'], ['D03.383.663.283.446.794.200', 'D03.633.100.150.446.794.200', 'D03.633.300.770.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D10'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['G02.712'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720'], ['G02.805'], ['G02.860'], ['E05.337.550.200.900', 'E05.624.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
44700,Ceramic bearings for total hip arthroplasty have high survivorship at 10 years.,"BACKGROUND: Ceramic bearings were introduced to reduce wear and increase long-term survivorship of total hip arthroplasty. In a previous study comparing ceramic with metal-on-polyethylene at 5 to 8 years, we found higher survivorship and no osteolysis for the ceramic bearings.QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether ceramic bearings have equal or superior survivorship compared with that for metal-on-polyethylene at longer followup; we also determined survivorship of the implant systems, the presence or absence of radiographic osteolysis, and incidence of device squeaking.METHODS: Five surgeons at five sites have followed 189 patients (216 hips) for a minimum of 10 years and average of 10.3 years (range, 10-12.4 years) comparing alumina ceramic bearings (144 hips) with cobalt chrome-on-polyethylene bearings (72 hips). We determined Kaplan-Meier survivorship of the bearing surface and implant systems and collected radiographic and clinical data.RESULTS: We observed no difference between the control metal-on-polyethylene and the alumina-bearing couple cohorts with regard to bearing-related failures (98.9% versus 99.1%). Revisions for any reason occurred in 10.5% of the control patients and 3.1% of the patients with alumina bearings. All femoral implants remain well fixed (100%), whereas one acetabular component (1%) is unstable in the control group. Osteolysis occurred in 26% of the control patients and in none of the patients with alumina bearings. Squeaking occurred in two of 144 hips (1.4%) of the patients with ceramic bearings.CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving the ceramic-on-ceramic bearings had fewer revisions for any reason and less osteolysis than the control metal-on-polyethylene at 10 years. Our data suggest ceramic bearings continue to provide an option for the young and more active patient and provide for a measure to compare other new alternative bearings that are currently available.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, therapeutic study.

31694,Three-dimensional structures of canine senile plaques.,"In this study, the three-dimensional structures of two types of canine senile plaques (SP), diffuse plaques (DP) and mature plaques (MP), were compared using a confocal laser scanning microscope. The three-dimensional observation revealed that canine DP were uneven nebula-like assemblies of amyloid-beta (Abeta), while MP were comparatively uniform assemblies of membrane-like or fibrous Abeta materials with some differences among subtypes (primitive, classic and compact). We also noticed the presence of areas with low-density Abeta deposition inside DP and MP, indicating degradation of Abeta. Double staining for Abeta and other SP constituents was also conducted. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) was mainly deposited as rough granules around Abeta assemblies in DP and both inside and around Abeta assemblies in MP. The patten of ubiquitin deposition was quite similar to that of APP. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astroglial projections were found around and inside Abeta assemblies in both types of SP, but were more prominent in MP than DP. DP were often invaded by neurofilament-positive neuronal processes (neurites), while no such neurites were observed inside MP. Dystrophic neurites were, however, frequently detected around MP. These results clearly showed that canine DP and MP have completely different three-dimensional structures, consistent with different processes of DP and MP formation.","['Aging', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Plaque, Amyloid']",11603806,"[['G07.345.124'], ['D12.644.024', 'D12.776.049.407.249.500', 'D12.776.543.039.500'], ['D12.776.049.407.249', 'D12.776.543.039', 'D12.776.645.468.500', 'D12.776.811.050'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['E01.370.350.515.395', 'E05.595.395'], ['C23.300.821']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
10885,[The role of surgical access in postoperative ventral hernia development].,"Long-term follow-up of 508 patients after various surgical procedures has been conducted. Of the 351 patients were operated on using a paramedian incision, 109 had an upper median laparotomy and the rest 48 had an oblique subcostal incision.

23506,Adjusting for differential-verification bias in diagnostic-accuracy studies: a Bayesian approach.,"In studies of diagnostic accuracy, the performance of an index test is assessed by verifying its results against those of a reference standard. If verification of index-test results by the preferred reference standard can be performed only in a subset of subjects, an alternative reference test could be given to the remainder. The drawback of this so-called differential-verification design is that the second reference test is often of lesser quality, or defines the target condition in a different way. Incorrectly treating results of the 2 reference standards as equivalent will lead to differential-verification bias. The Bayesian methods presented in this paper use a single model to (1) acknowledge the different nature of the 2 reference standards and (2) make simultaneous inferences about the population prevalence and the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the index test with respect to both reference tests, in relation to latent disease status. We illustrate this approach using data from a study on the accuracy of the elbow extension test for diagnosis of elbow fractures in patients with elbow injury, using either radiography or follow-up as reference standards.","['Bayes Theorem', 'Bias', 'Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Reference Standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",21228702,"[['E05.318.740.600.200', 'N05.715.360.750.625.150', 'N06.850.520.830.600.200'], ['N05.715.350.150', 'N06.850.490.500'], ['E01.370'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['E05.978.808'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This first paper presents the results. A response rate of 175 returned questionnaires from the 247 consultants was obtained (70.9%). Analysis revealed that the majority of consultants use antibiotics, mouthwashes, sutures, analgesics and postoperative review and the minority steroids and peroperative local anaesthetic, routinely in the majority of cases. Approximately half routinely use a chisel as opposed to a bur for bone removal. The consultants who gave all their patients steroids were significantly (p less than 0.01) more likely to possess a medical qualification than the consultants who did not.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alveolectomy', 'Analgesics', 'Anesthesia, Dental', 'Anesthesia, Local', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Dental Service, Hospital', 'Drug Utilization', 'Education, Dental', 'Education, Medical', 'Humans', 'Medical Audit', 'Molar, Third', 'Mouthwashes', 'State Medicine', 'Sutures', 'Tooth Extraction', 'United Kingdom']",1622965,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E04.545.550.110', 'E06.645.550.110'], ['D27.505.696.663.850.014', 'D27.505.954.427.040'], ['E03.155.141', 'E06.045'], ['E03.155.086.231'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.298', 'N02.421.240.200', 'N04.452.442.452.422.298'], ['N04.452.706.477'], ['I02.358.274'], ['I02.358.399'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.761.700.250.500', 'N05.700.175.500'], ['A14.549.167.860.525.500'], ['D25.583', 'D27.720.102.583', 'D27.720.269.583', 'J01.637.051.583'], ['N03.349.550.902', 'N03.858'], ['E07.858.690.820'], ['E04.545.700', 'E06.645.700'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
16786,Absence of a correlation of androgen receptor gene CAG repeat length and prostate cancer risk in an African-American population.,"Shorter androgen receptor gene CAG repeat length has been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, an earlier age of onset, and more advanced stage of disease. Studies comparing the distribution of CAG repeat lengths within different populations have reported that racial groups with higher prostate cancer incidence also have shorter CAG repeat lengths. We evaluated CAG repeat length in 685 black men in Louisiana, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia who were participating in prostate cancer screening, comparing the 118 who were diagnosed with prostate cancer with 567 who had normal serum prostate-specific antigen levels and no evidence of cancer on digital rectal examination. The median CAG repeat length was 21 among cases and 19 among controls (P = 0.11). Cases were significantly older than controls, with a median age of 68 years compared with 54 years (P < 0.0001). After adjusting for age, we found no association between prostate cancer risk and CAG repeat length (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.98-1.13; P = 0.16). Dividing CAG repeat lengths into septiles and calculating the odds ratio for each revealed no specific repeat-length range with a significantly elevated or depressed risk of prostate cancer, but a trend test showed a significant association between longer CAG repeat lengths and an elevated risk of prostate cancer (P = 0.02). Neither grade nor stage was associated with CAG repeat length. This study confirms earlier reports that black men have shorter CAG repeat lengths than reported white and Asian populations. We did not find an increased risk of prostate cancer among black men with fewer CAG repeats.","['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Receptors, Androgen', 'Reference Values', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States']",15479493,"[['M01.060.116'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['D13.444.308.425'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['G05.365.795'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E01.789'], ['C04.588.945.440.770', 'C12.294.260.750', 'C12.294.565.625', 'C12.758.409.750'], ['D12.776.826.750.150'], ['E05.978.810'], ['G02.111.570.080.708', 'G05.360.080.708'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

10298,Tissue distribution and subcellular localization of rabbit liver metalloendopeptidase.,"We have previously isolated rabbit liver microsomal metalloendopeptidase (MEP) as a candidate for the processing enzyme of vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins. A cDNA coding for MEP has revealed that it is structurally related to metalloendopeptidase-24.15, which catalyzes the proteolytic processing of several bioactive peptides. In this study we examined the tissue distribution and subcellular localization of MEP by light and electron microscopic immunohistochemical methods, in addition to Northern blot analysis. Chicken polyclonal antibodies were raised by using synthetic peptides AG1 (Met31-Asn46) and AG3 (Asp537-Gly551) derived from the sequence of MEP. Both anti-AG1 and anti-AG3 antibodies reacted specifically with MEP, as judged by Western blotting and immunohistochemical methods. Both antibodies gave an identical staining distribution, which was localized on the luminal cell surfaces and in the cytoplasm of the following organs: liver, brain, lungs, kidneys, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, placenta, epididymis, uterus, ovary, and oviduct. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of MEP mRNA is similar to its immunohistochemical distribution except in the heart. These results suggest that MEP may participate more closely in a degradation role in peptide metabolism in various tissues than in a processing role of the proprotein, like metalloendopeptidase-24.15.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Brain', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cytoplasm', 'Duodenum', 'Female', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Metalloendopeptidases', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rabbits', 'Stomach', 'Testis', 'Tissue Distribution']",9010467,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.095', 'E05.301.300.074', 'E05.601.100'], ['A08.186.211'], ['A11.284.149'], ['A11.284.430.214'], ['A03.556.124.684.124', 'A03.556.875.249'], ['E05.478.566.350', 'E05.478.583.400', 'E05.601.470.350'], ['A05.810.453'], ['A03.620'], ['A04.411'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.625', 'E05.595.402.625'], ['A11.284.835.540.541'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['A03.556.875.875'], ['A05.360.444.849', 'A05.360.576.782', 'A06.300.312.782'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

28490,"Availability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to earthworms (Eisenia andrei, Oligochaeta) in field-polluted soils and soil-sediment mixtures.","The bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for earthworms (Eisenia andrei) was experimentally determined in seven field-polluted soils and 15 soil-sediment mixtures. The pore-water concentration of most PAHs was higher than predicted. However, most of the compound was associated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and not directly available for uptake by earthworms. The apparent sorption could be reasonably predicted on the basis of interactions with DOC; however, the biota-soil accumulation factors (BSAFs) for earthworms were up to two orders of magnitude lower than predicted by equilibrium partitioning. The large variability between sites was not fully explained by differences in sorption. Experimental results indicate that the pool of freely dissolved PAHs in the pore water became partially depleted because of uptake by the earthworms and that bioaccumulation is thus also influenced by the kinetics of PAH desorption and mass transport. A pilot study with Lumbricus rubellus showed that steady-state body residues were well correlated to E. andrei. Current results show that depositing dredge spoil on land may lead to increased bioavailability of the lower-molecular-weight PAHs. However, risk assessment can conservatively rely on equilibrium partitioning, but accurate prediction requires quantification of the kinetics of bioavailability.","['Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Kinetics', 'Oligochaeta', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants']",12685711,"[['B01.050'], ['G03.787.151', 'G07.690.725.129'], ['G01.311.330', 'G16.500.320'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['B01.050.500.091.657'], ['D02.455.426.559.847', 'D04.615'], ['D20.721', 'G01.311.820', 'G16.500.275.815', 'N06.230.600'], ['D27.888.284.756']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

24109,Ciliary body edema after scleral buckling surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.,"PURPOSE: Choroidal detachment and anterior chamber (AC) shallowing develop in some cases after scleral buckling surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD). Postoperative angle-closure glaucoma has been reported to occur in 4% of cases. It is supposed that compression by the local scleral buckling induces ciliary body edema and angle narrowing. This study aimed to evaluate quantitatively the time course of changes in ciliary body thickness and AC depth (ACD) before and after the scleral buckling procedure using ultrasound biomicroscopy.DESIGN: Prospective consecutive case series.PARTICIPANTS: Forty-six eyes of 44 patients (43.7+/-18.1 years old [mean +/- standard deviation]) undergoing rhegmatogenous RD surgery.METHODS: Ciliary body thickness and ACD were measured before and 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after the procedure. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to evaluate ACD and ciliary body thickness.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time course of changes in ciliary body thickness and ACD.RESULTS: The surgery caused significant increases in ciliary body thickness at 3, 7, and 14 days postoperatively (P<0.0001, Bonferroni multiple comparison). Ciliary body edema reached its peak 3 days after surgery, followed by a gradual decrease thereafter. Ciliary body thickness in the encircling group was statistically greater than in the segmental buckling group at 3 and 7 days postoperatively (P<0.001, Student's t test). The ciliary body was significantly thicker in the direction of buckling than on the opposite side 3 days after surgery (P = 0.0079). In the encircling group, retinal reattachment surgery significantly decreased ACD 3 days after surgery (P = 0.018), whereas no significant fluctuations were found in the buckling group.CONCLUSIONS: Even without apparent choroidal detachment and a shallow AC, subclinical ciliary edema existed in all directions of all eyes for at least 1 month after the scleral buckling procedure. The ciliary body in the direction of scleral buckling showed greater edema than the other areas. Eyes treated with the encircling band showed greater ciliary edema than those treated with segmental buckling alone.","['Adult', 'Anterior Chamber', 'Ciliary Body', 'Edema', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Acoustic', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Scleral Buckling', 'Time Factors', 'Uveal Diseases']",16290050,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A09.371.060.067'], ['A09.371.060.160', 'A09.371.894.280'], ['C23.888.277'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.515.370', 'E01.370.350.850.565', 'E05.595.370'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['C11.768.648'], ['E04.540.890'], ['G01.910.857'], ['C11.941']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

This study examined the occurrence and progression of vascular damage in mouse intestine when a contrast agent was present during shockwave treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anesthetized hairless mice were injected with Albunex contrast agent or a gas-body-free blank, and exposed to sham, 200 or 800 lithotripter shockwaves.RESULTS: Exposure of the mouse abdomen to lithotripter shockwaves produced petechiae in the intestinal wall and hemorrhage into the lumen. Contrast-agent gas bodies greatly enhanced the numbers of petechiae (but not the hemorrhages), relative to the blank agent. When evaluation of these effects was delayed for one day, both effects decreased, and the gas-body-associated petechiae seemed to disappear. However, survival significantly decreased for mice with added gas bodies and shockwave treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a gas-body-based ultrasound contrast agent enhances vascular side effects of shockwave lithotripsy. Although there are great uncertainties in relating these observations to human clinical conditions, a delay in planned treatment might be prudent for patients scheduled for shockwave lithotripsy soon after receiving gas-body-based ultrasound contrast agents.","['Albumins', 'Animals', 'Contrast Media', 'Gases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Intestines', 'Lithotripsy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Hairless', 'Ultrasonography']",10411095,"[['D12.776.034'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['D01.362'], ['C06.405.227', 'C23.550.414.788'], ['A03.556.124'], ['E02.600', 'E04.943.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.200', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.200', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.230'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24749,Small-dose bupivacaine-sufentanil prevents cardiac output modifications after spinal anesthesia.,"Spinal injection of small-dose (SD) bupivacaine decreases the likelihood of hypotension compared with large-dose (LD) bupivacaine. We assumed that a SD of bupivacaine could also prevent the decrease in cardiac output (CO). Patients undergoing elective urologic, lower abdominal, or lower limb surgery under spinal anesthesia were included in this prospective randomized study. Spinal injection consisted of 5 mug of sufentanil and either SD (7.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine with glucosemonohydrate 80 mg/mL; n = 19 patients) or LD (12.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine with glucosemonohydrate 80 mg/mL; n = 19 patients). CO (impedance cardiography), arterial blood pressure, and heart rate) were measured at 1 min before performance of spinal block and 2, 10, and 30 min after the intrathecal injection. Sensory level was also assessed at 30 min. CO was higher in the SD group as compared with the LD group from 2 min to 30 min after spinal anesthesia. Moreover, CO increased at 2 min in the SD group and decreased at 10 and 30 min in the LD group compared with baseline value. In conclusion, SD bupivacaine provides successful anesthesia and gives better CO stability than LD.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anesthesia, Spinal', 'Bupivacaine', 'Cardiac Output', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sufentanil']",16244022,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E03.155.086.331'], ['D02.065.199.239', 'D02.092.146.113.239'], ['E01.370.370.380.150', 'G09.330.380.124'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D03.383.621.265.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

2975,Effect of dissolved oxygen and carbon-nitrogen loads on denitrification by an aerobic consortium.,"Four samples of natural ecosystems and one sample from an activated sludge treatment plant were mixed together and progressively adapted to alternating aerobic/anoxic phases in the presence of nitrate in order to enrich the microflora in aerobic denitrifiers. Aerobic denitrifying performances of this mixed ecosystem at various dissolved oxygen concentrations and various carbon-nitrogen loads were evaluated and compared to those obtained with the aerobic denitrifier Microvirgula aerodenitrificans. The consortium and the pure strain exhibited an aerobic denitrifying activity at air saturation conditions (7 mg dissolved oxygen 1(-1)), i.e. there was co-respiration of the two electron acceptors with significant specific nitrate reduction rates. Dissolved oxygen concentrations had no influence on denitrifying performances above a defined threshold: 0.35 mg l(-1) for the consortium and 4.5 mg l(-1) for M. aerodenitrificans respectively. Under these thresholds, decreasing the dissolved oxygen concentrations enhanced the denitrifying activity of each culture. The higher the carbon and nitrogen loads, the higher the performance of the aerobic denitrifying ecosystem. However, for M. aerodenitrificans, the nitrate reduction percentage was affected more by variations in nitrogen load than in carbon load.","['Aerobiosis', 'Biomass', 'Nitrogen', 'Oxygen', 'Sewage']",11092629,"[['G02.111.017', 'G03.049'], ['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['D01.268.604', 'D01.362.625'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['D20.944.932.500']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
3634,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and paracetamol use in Queensland and in the whole of Australia.","BACKGROUND: Cross national drug utilization studies can provide information about different influences on physician prescribing. This is important for medicines with issues around safety and quality of use, like non selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ns-NSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. To enable comparison of prescription medicine use across different jurisdictions with a range of population sizes, data first need to be compared within Australia to understand whether use in a smaller sub-population may be considered as representative of the total use within Australia. The aim of this study was to compare the utilization of non selective NSAID, COX-2 inhibitors and paracetamol between Queensland and Australia.METHOD: Dispensing data were obtained for concession beneficiaries for Australia for ns-NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and paracetamol subsidized by the PBS over the period 1997-2003. The same data were purchased for Queensland. Data were converted to Defined Daily Dose (DDD)/1000 beneficiaries/day (World Health Organization anatomical therapeutic chemical classification, 2005).RESULTS: Total NSAID and paracetamol consumption were similar in Australia and Queensland. Ns-NSAID use decreased sharply with the introduction of COX-2 inhibitors (from approximately 80 to 40 DDD/1000 beneficiaries/day). Paracetamol was constant (approximately 45 DDD/1000 beneficiaries/day). COX-2 inhibitors consumption was initially higher in Queensland than in the whole of Australia.CONCLUSION: Despite initial divergence in celecoxib use between Queensland and Australia, the use of ns-NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and paracetamol overall, in concession beneficiaries, was comparable in Australia and Queensland.","['Acetaminophen', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal', 'Australia', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Drug Utilization', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Queensland']",18816393,"[['D02.065.199.092.040', 'D02.092.146.113.092.040'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030', 'D27.505.954.329.030'], ['Z01.639.100', 'Z01.678.100.373'], ['D27.505.519.389.310.500', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500.500.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030.500.500', 'D27.505.954.329.030.500.500'], ['N04.452.706.477'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05'], ['N04.590.374.577', 'N05.300.625'], ['Z01.639.100.937', 'Z01.678.100.373.937']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

We studied the mechanism of the action of MPTP through testing monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, deprenyl and L-prolyl-L-leucyl-glycinamide (PLG) against the neurotoxicity of MPTP. The results indicated that: (1) the use of MPTP can establish a useful parkinsonian animal model in rhesus monkey; (2) pretreatment with deprenyl can effectively prevent the neurotoxicity of MPTP; and (3) whether PLG can prevent or alleviate the neurotoxicity of MPTP requires further study.","['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'MPTP Poisoning', 'MSH Release-Inhibiting Hormone', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Parkinson Disease, Secondary', 'Selegiline']",1971785,"[['B01.050'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['C10.228.140.079.862.800.300', 'C10.228.662.600.700.250', 'C10.720.606', 'C25.723.705.400'], ['D06.472.699.327.700.500', 'D12.644.400.400.700.500', 'D12.644.548.365.700.500', 'D12.776.631.650.405.700.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.510.550'], ['C10.228.140.079.862.800', 'C10.228.662.600.700'], ['D02.092.471.683.915']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2349,Hypnotherapy and cognitive behaviour therapy of acute stress disorder: a 3-year follow-up.,"The long-term benefits of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for trauma survivors with acute stress disorder were investigated by assessing patients 3 years after treatment. Civilian trauma survivors (n=87) were randomly allocated to six sessions of CBT, CBT combined with hypnosis, or supportive counselling (SC), 69 completed treatment, and 53 were assessed 2 years post-treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. In terms of treatment completers, 2 CBT patients (10%), 4 CBT/hypnosis patients (22%), and 10 SC patients (63%) met PTSD criteria at 2-years follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that 12 CBT patients (36%), 14 CBT/hypnosis patients (46%), and 16 SC patients (67%) met PTSD criteria at 2-year follow-up. Patients who received CBT and CBT/hypnosis reported less re-experiencing and less avoidance symptoms than patients who received SC.

30441,Enhancement of bone mineral density and body mass in newborn chickens by in ovo injection of ionic-hydroxyapatite nanoparticles of bacterial origin.,"Using non-drug, non-surgical treatments for improving bone mineral diseases in newborn babies is an important topic for neonatologists. The present study introduces bacterial synthesized ionic nano-hydroxyapatite (Bio-HA) for the development of bone mineral density in the chicken embryo model. In vitro cytotoxicity analyses were demonstrated the optimal concentrations of Bio-HA compared to a chemically-synthesized hydroxyapatite (Ch-HA). Toxicity of Bio-HA on MCF-7 human cell lines was negligible at the concentrations less than 500 ìg/mL whereas Ch-HA showed similar results at the concentrations less than 100 ìg/mL. Therefore, concentrations at 50 ìg/mL and 100 ìg/mL were selected for in ovo injection of both materials into the fertilized eggs. The newly hatched chickens were sacrificed in order to monitor their serological factors, total body mass, bone mineral contents and bone mineral density. The results confirmed that Bio-HA increased the average body weight and bone mineral indices of chickens in comparison to the Ch-HA and negative controls (normal saline and intact groups). In view of the intact group, no liver or kidney damage occurred in the groups receiving Bio-HA which promises the effectiveness of these nanoparticles for the treatment of afterbirth bone mineral deficiency.","['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Density', 'Calcification, Physiologic', 'Chickens', 'Durapatite', 'Enterobacter aerogenes', 'Humans', 'Injections', 'Ions', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Nanoparticles']",30671631,"[['B01.050'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['G11.427.100'], ['G07.345.155.500', 'G07.345.500.325.377.625.050.500.175', 'G11.427.578.050.500.175'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374.075.025.300.150', 'D01.146.360.050.300.200', 'D01.578.122.477.300', 'D01.695.625.675.650.075.025.300.150'], ['B03.440.450.425.275.099', 'B03.660.250.150.170.049'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.530'], ['D01.248.497'], ['A05.810.453'], ['A03.620'], ['A11.251.210.190.630'], ['J01.637.512.600']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

32165,Hepatocyte-targeted HFE and TFR2 control hepcidin expression in mice.,"Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE), transferrin-receptor 2 (TfR2), hemojuvelin, hepcidin, or ferroportin genes. Hepcidin is a key iron regulator, which is secreted by the liver, and decreases serum iron levels by causing the down-regulation of the iron transporter, ferroportin. Mutations in either HFE or TfR2 lower hepcidin levels, implying that both HFE and TfR2 are necessary for regulation of hepcidin expression. In this study, we used a recombinant adeno-associated virus, AAV2/8, for hepatocyte-specific expression of either Hfe or Tfr2 in mice. Expression of Hfe in Hfe-null mice both increased Hfe and hepcidin mRNA and lowered hepatic iron and Tf saturation. Expression of Tfr2 in Tfr2-deficient mice had a similar effect, whereas expression of Hfe in Tfr2-deficient mice or of Tfr2 in Hfe-null mice had no effect on liver or serum iron levels. Expression of Hfe in wild-type mice increased hepcidin mRNA and lowered iron levels. In contrast, expression of Tfr2 had no effect on wild-type mice. These findings suggest that Hfe is limiting in formation of the Hfe/Tfr2 complex that regulates hepcidin expression. In addition, these studies show that the use of recombinant AAV vector to deliver genes is a promising approach for studying physiologic consequences of protein complexes.","['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hemochromatosis Protein', 'Hepatocytes', 'Hepcidins', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Immunoblotting', 'Iron', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2']",20177050,"[['B04.280.030'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.644.050', 'D12.776.543.695.054'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.308'], ['G05.360.337'], ['D12.776.395.550.489.200', 'D12.776.543.550.439.200', 'D23.050.301.500.100.363', 'D23.050.705.552.100.375'], ['A11.436.348'], ['D12.776.494.249', 'D12.776.543.695.054.425'], ['D12.776.395.550.489', 'D12.776.543.550.439', 'D23.050.301.500.100', 'D23.050.705.552.100'], ['E05.478.566.320', 'E05.601.470.320'], ['D01.268.556.412', 'D01.268.956.287', 'D01.552.544.412'], ['D12.776.543'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['D12.776.260.735.875', 'D12.776.660.235.700.875']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3126,Early detection of type 2 diabetes: the role of the community nurse.,"Recent changes to the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes have raised concerns that if steps are not taken to address relevant issues, the number of diagnosed sufferers will escalate in future years, with a similar increase in the prevalence of associated complications. Research suggests that for many patients, complications are evident at the time of diagnosis, and may have been present for several years before a diagnosis was made. Late presentation is the cause of considerable morbidity and mortality among these patients, largely because undiagnosed complications are often irreversible by the time the underlying diabetes is discovered. The current emphasis on public health augments the need for community nurses to recognize warning signs, particularly in patients who are at an increased risk of developing diabetes. This article aims to raise awareness of early signs and symptoms, and gives a brief insight into some of the associated health problems. If community nurses are to play a significant role in reducing the potentially devastating effects of this disease, they will need to be involved tin educating patients and implementing screening and intervention programmes.","['Community Health Nursing', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Humans', ""Nurse's Role"", 'Nursing Diagnosis', 'Risk Factors']",11907442,"[['H02.478.676.150', 'N02.421.143.150'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.316.616.625.450', 'N05.300.100.337'], ['N04.590.233.508.480.110'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
32660,Endoplasmic reticulum chaperone GRP78 mediates cigarette smoke-induced necroptosis and injury in bronchial epithelium.,"Introduction: Bronchial epithelial cell death and airway inflammation induced by cigarette smoke (CS) have been involved in the pathogenesis of COPD. GRP78, belonging to heat shock protein 70 family, has been implicated in cell death and inflammation, while little is known about its roles in COPD. Here, we demonstrate that GRP78 regulates CS-induced necroptosis and injury in bronchial epithelial cells.Materials and methods: GRP78 and necroptosis markers were examined in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell line, primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells, and mouse lungs. siRNA targeting GRP78 gene and necroptosis inhibitor were used. Expression of inflammatory cytokines, mucin MUC5AC, and related signaling pathways were detected.Results: Exposure to CS significantly increased the expression of GRP78 and necroptosis markers in HBE cell line, primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells, and mouse lungs. Inhibition of GRP78 significantly suppressed CS extract (CSE)-induced necroptosis. Furthermore, GRP78-necroptosis cooperatively regulated CSE-induced inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL6), IL8, and mucin MUC5AC in HBE cells, likely through the activation of nuclear factor (NF-êB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) pathways, respectively.Conclusion: Taken together, our results demonstrate that GRP78 promotes CSE-induced inflammatory response and mucus hyperproduction in airway epithelial cells, likely through upregulation of necroptosis and subsequent activation of NF-êB and AP-1 pathways. Thus, inhibition of GRP78 and/or inhibition of necroptosis could be the effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of COPD.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bronchi', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles', 'Indoles', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Lung Injury', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mucin 5AC', 'Mucus', 'NF-kappa B', 'Necrosis', 'Pneumonia', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor AP-1', 'Transfection']",29445274,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['A04.411.125'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['A11.436'], ['D12.776.580.216'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.383.129.308'], ['D03.633.100.473'], ['D23.469'], ['C08.381.520', 'C26.891.554'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['D12.776.395.560.631.100.500'], ['A12.200.503'], ['D05.500.672', 'D12.776.260.600', 'D12.776.660.600', 'D12.776.930.600'], ['C23.550.717'], ['C01.748.610', 'C08.381.677', 'C08.730.610'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D20.633.937'], ['F01.145.805'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D12.776.260.108.875', 'D12.776.930.127.875'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24047,Improving flavor metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by mixed culture with Wickerhamomyces anomalus for Chinese Baijiu making.,"Yeasts are the most important microorganisms in the fermentation of Chinese Baijiu and the interaction of these yeasts could impact the quality of Baijiu. In this study, we initially characterized the Baijiu yeasts and evaluated their fermentation potential. Wickerhamomyces anomalus GZ3 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae G20 were found to generate high yields of ethyl acetate (2.76 g/L) and 2-phenylethanol, respectively. Results also indicated that the use of W. anomalus along with S. cerevisiae increased volatile compounds production, the maximum ethyl acetate production was observed in S. cerevisiae and W. anomalus at 106:106 ratio and have increased by 33 % compared with single culture of W. anomalus. Besides, there was a significant increase of 2-phenylethanol (3.29 g/L) production in single culture of S. cerevisiae with the addition of l-phenylalanine. However, the conversion of l-phenylalanine in mixed culture had significant impact on the yeasts interaction and end flavor of Baijiu. Thus, the present study provided new insights into yeasts interactions in Baijiu fermentation and the effect of some primary metabolites on the end flavor and Baijiu quality.","['Acetates', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Candida', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'China', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fermentation', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Food Industry', 'Pichia', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Taste']",29551466,"[['D02.241.081.018', 'D10.251.400.045'], ['G07.203.100.100', 'J02.200.100'], ['B01.300.107.795.095', 'B01.300.381.147', 'B01.300.930.176'], ['E01.370.225.500.223', 'E05.200.500.265', 'E05.242.223', 'E05.481.500.249'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['G02.111.158.249', 'G03.191.249'], ['D26.650.294', 'D27.720.372.300.353', 'D27.720.744.294', 'G07.203.300.514.500.400', 'J02.500.514.500.400'], ['J01.576.423'], ['B01.300.107.795.700', 'B01.300.930.600'], ['B01.300.107.795.785.800', 'B01.300.930.705.655'], ['F02.830.816.724', 'G11.561.790.724']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
47817,Yi Qi Qing Re Gao formula ameliorates puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis by suppressing inflammation and apoptosis.,"BACKGROUND: Yi Qi Qing Re Gao (YQQRG) formula is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine used to treat chronic nephritis. This study was designed to evaluate the underlying mechanism in the use of YQQRG formula to treat nephrosis induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN).METHODS: Thirty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups of 12 rats each: a sham group, a vehicle-treated PAN model group (PAN), and a group treated with YQQRG (PAN + YQQRG). The PAN model was established by a single intravenous injection of PAN at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight; rats in the sham group received the same volume of saline. Twenty-four hour urinary protein was measured 0, 3, 5, 10, and 15 days after the injection. The rats were sacrificed on day 10 and day 15 and the serum lipid profile examined. The renal cortex of each rat was stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent and the pathologic alterations and ultrastructural changes were examined by transmission electron microscopy. In situ cell apoptosis was detected by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. Transcriptive levels of inflammatory markers and molecules associated with apoptosis were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction and expression of proteins was examined by either immunohistochemistry or Western blot analysis.RESULTS: YQQRG significantly decreased urinary protein level, and lowered serum lipid level. YQQRG also attenuated histologic lesions in the rat kidneys. Activation of inflammatory markers was largely restored by the administration of YQQRG. TUNEL assay showed that YQQRG decreased the number of apoptotic cells. Both mRNA and protein levels of caspase-3 were significantly reduced in the group treated with YQQRG, whereas expression of the Bcl-2 protein increased in the YQQRG group.CONCLUSIONS: YQQRG alleviated kidney injury in PAN-treated rats, possibly through anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.","['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nephritis', 'Nephrosis', 'Phytotherapy', 'Puromycin Aminonucleoside', 'Qi', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",26014479,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.158'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126.350.300', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126.350.300', 'D12.644.360.075.405.350.300', 'D12.776.476.075.405.350.300'], ['D20.215.784.500.350', 'D26.335'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['C23.550.470'], ['A05.810.453'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.580', 'E05.595.402.580'], ['C12.777.419.570', 'C13.351.968.419.570'], ['C12.777.419.630', 'C13.351.968.419.630'], ['E02.190.755'], ['D02.241.223.200.380.650', 'D03.633.100.759.590.138.325.800', 'D03.633.100.759.590.138.711.650', 'D09.408.051.788.650', 'D13.570.230.229.650', 'D13.570.583.138.325.800', 'D13.570.583.138.711.650'], ['I01.076.201.450.654.558.520.300', 'K01.752.730'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['E05.393.620.500.706']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
7992,Multiple marker second trimester serum screening for pre-eclampsia.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an appropriate combination of maternal serum inhibin A, free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (free beta-hCG), unconjugated estriol (uE3), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may be an effective means of screening for pre-eclampsia in the second trimester of pregnancy.SETTING: Women who attended an antenatal clinic in Oxford, from whom serum samples were stored, 19 of whom subsequently developed pre-eclampsia.METHODS: Serum inhibin A, free beta-hCG, uE3, and AFP were measured in 32 serum samples collected from the 19 women who developed pre-eclampsia and, for each sample, in three control samples collected from women with unaffected pregnancies matched for gestational age and maternal age.RESULTS: In pregnancies that developed pre-eclampsia the median inhibin A value was raised (1.7 multiples of the median (MoM) for unaffected pregnancies (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1 to 2.7 MoM), the median free beta-hCG was raised (2.1, 1.4 to 3.3 MoM) and the median uE3 was lowered (0.8, 0.6 to 0.98 MoM) after 19 completed weeks of gestation and at least 2 weeks before the onset ofproteinuria. Values of AFP were similar in affected and unaffected pregnancies. Combining the values ofinhibin A, free beta-hCG, and uE3 to form a screening test would detect an estimated 55% of affected pregnancies with a false positive rate of 5%.CONCLUSIONS: Inhibin A, free beta-hCG, and uE3 in combination may be a useful screening test during the second trimester for pre-eclampsia.","['Biomarkers', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human', 'Estriol', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibins', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Second', 'Proteinuria', 'alpha-Fetoproteins']",11480445,"[['D23.101'], ['D06.472.699.322.326.125', 'D06.472.699.649.367.125', 'D12.644.548.726.367.125', 'D12.776.780.400.125', 'D23.101.140.325', 'D23.101.175'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.331', 'D06.472.334.851.437.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.334.968', 'D06.472.699.337', 'D12.644.548.387', 'D12.776.395.439'], ['C13.703.395.249'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['G08.686.707.490'], ['C12.777.934.734', 'C13.351.968.934.734', 'C23.888.942.750'], ['D12.776.124.790.106.092', 'D12.776.320.525.500', 'D12.776.377.228.500', 'D12.776.377.715.085.092', 'D23.101.140.050']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
36127,Tandem mass spectrometry for the direct assay of enzymes in dried blood spots: application to newborn screening for mucopolysaccharidosis II (Hunter disease).,"BACKGROUND: A treatment for mucopolysaccharidosis II (Hunter syndrome) has recently become available. Therefore, we developed a high-throughput assay method appropriate for newborn screening for the relevant enzyme, iduronate 2-sulfatase.METHODS: We synthesized a new iduronate 2-sulfatase substrate that can be used to assay the enzyme by use of tandem mass spectrometry together with an internal standard. The assay uses a dried blood spot on a newborn screening card as the enzyme source.RESULTS: When the assay was tested on dried blood spots, the iduronate 2-sulfatase activity measured for 13 patients with Hunter syndrome was well below the interval found for 57 randomly chosen newborns. The assay was more sensitive than previously reported iduronate 2-sulfatase assays.CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed tandem mass spectrometry assay has the potential to be adopted for newborn screening of Hunter syndrome. This method also has the potential to be carried out in multiplex fashion to assay several different enzymes relevant to lysosomal storage diseases that are assayed in a single infusion into the mass spectrometer.","['Blood Specimen Collection', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mucopolysaccharidosis II', 'Neonatal Screening']",17082248,"[['E01.370.225.998.110', 'E04.665.150', 'E05.200.998.110'], ['E01.370.225.124.200', 'E05.196.427.200', 'E05.200.124.200'], ['D09.400.430', 'D12.776.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.196.566'], ['C10.597.606.360.455.750', 'C16.320.322.500.750', 'C16.320.400.525.750', 'C16.320.565.202.715.645', 'C16.320.565.595.600.645', 'C17.300.550.575.645', 'C18.452.648.202.715.645', 'C18.452.648.595.600.645'], ['E01.370.225.910', 'E01.370.500.580', 'E05.200.910', 'E05.318.308.980.438.580.580', 'N02.421.726.233.443.816', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.500.575', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.580.580', 'N06.850.780.500.580']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
27085,Expression patterns of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) and parathyroid hormone receptor type 1 (PTHR1) during human development are suggestive of roles specific for each gene that are not mediated through the PTHrP/PTHR1 paracrine signaling pathway.,"Close temporal and spatial relationships between Pthrp and Pthr1 gene expression are reported during fetal life in rats, suggestive of a developmental role via a paracrine signaling pathway. In agreement, disruption of this signaling pathway is associated with developmental defects, as documented in mice and humans. Surprisingly, however, only few organs are affected. We report here PTHrP and PTHR1 gene expression during human embryo-fetal development. We describe three patterns: in some organs, both genes are active ('hand-in-glove' fashion), while in others either PTHrP or PTHR1 transcripts are detected. In addition, in some tissues, expression of PTHrP or PTHR1 genes is transient. Abnormal development has been documented only for organs expressing both genes. The patterns that we observe are compatible with specific roles for each gene not mediated through the PTHrP/PTHR1 signaling pathway.","['Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Mesoderm', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Peptide Hormones', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptor, Parathyroid Hormone, Type 1', 'Receptors, Parathyroid Hormone', 'Signal Transduction']",12609604,"[['E05.393.332'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A16.504.660'], ['G04.085.600'], ['D06.472.699.591', 'D12.644.276.908', 'D12.644.548.588', 'D12.776.467.890', 'D23.529.890'], ['D06.472.699', 'D12.644.548'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.650.100', 'D12.776.543.750.750.600.100'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.650', 'D12.776.543.750.750.600'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
38159,Lipid core peptide/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) as a highly potent intranasal vaccine delivery system against Group A streptococcus.,"Rheumatic heart disease represents a leading cause of mortality caused by Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections transmitted through the respiratory route. Although GAS infections can be treated with antibiotics these are often inadequate. An efficacious GAS vaccine holds more promise, with intranasal vaccination especially attractive, as it mimics the natural route of infections and should be able to induce mucosal IgA and systemic IgG immunity. Nanoparticles were prepared by either encapsulating or coating lipopeptide-based vaccine candidate (LCP-1) on the surface of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). In vitro study showed that encapsulation of LCP-1 vaccine into nanoparticles improved uptake and maturations of antigen-presenting cells. The immunogenicity of lipopeptide incorporated PLGA-based nanoparticles was compared with peptides co-administered with mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B in mice upon intranasal administration. Higher levels of J14-specific salivary mucosal IgA and systemic antibody IgG titres were observed for groups immunized with encapsulated LCP-1 compared to LCP-1 coated nanoparticles or free LCP-1. Systemic antibodies obtained from LCP-1 encapsulated PLGA NPs inhibited the growth of bacteria in six different GAS strains. Our results show that PLGA-based lipopeptide delivery is a promising approach for rational design of a simple, effective and patient friendly intranasal GAS vaccine resulting in mucosal IgA response.","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Administration, Intranasal', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial', 'Cholera Toxin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lipopeptides', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles', 'Polyglycolic Acid', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Streptococcal Vaccines', 'Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Vaccination']",27659862,"[['D27.505.696.477.067'], ['E02.319.267.120.655.500'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.107', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.125', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.125'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.115.180', 'D23.946.123.194', 'D23.946.330.150'], ['E02.319.300'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.026', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.026', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.026'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['D10.477', 'D12.644.365'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['D05.750.728.780', 'D25.720.728.780', 'J01.637.051.720.728.780'], ['D02.241.511.459.450.500', 'D05.750.728.780.500', 'D25.720.728.780.500', 'J01.637.051.720.728.780.500'], ['D20.215.894.135.750'], ['B03.353.750.737.872.575', 'B03.510.400.800.872.575', 'B03.510.550.737.872.575'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.530.890', 'E05.478.550.600.890', 'N02.421.726.758.310.890', 'N06.850.780.200.425.900', 'N06.850.780.680.310.890']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

46125,Tuberculosis and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome at a New York City hospital: 1978-1985.,"Recent reports have described an increase in cases of tuberculosis in several urban centers. To investigate the possible relationship between tuberculosis and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), we reviewed case records at a New York City hospital between 1978 and 1985. During this period, tuberculosis occurred in 15.1 percent of AIDS patients with a history of parenteral drug use and 4.4 percent of all other patients with AIDS. The yearly rate of tuberculosis more than doubled during the study period; this increase was entirely attributable to cases among patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex and parenteral drug users, a group at high risk for the development of AIDS. Patients with AIDS and tuberculosis were younger and more frequently men than other patients with tuberculosis, and were more likely to have extrapulmonic disease. In the majority of patients, tuberculosis occurred prior to confirmation of CDC-defined AIDS. Forty-four percent of patients with AIDS-related complex at the time of diagnosis of tuberculosis subsequently developed AIDS. Mycobacterium tuberculosis appears to be yet another opportunistic agent to which patients with AIDS retroviral-induced immunodeficiency are susceptible.","['AIDS-Related Complex', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Urban', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium Infections', 'New York City', 'Population Surveillance', 'Substance-Related Disorders', 'Tuberculosis', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary']",3802929,"[['C01.221.250.875.080', 'C01.221.812.640.400.080', 'C01.778.640.400.080', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.080', 'C01.925.813.400.080', 'C01.925.839.080', 'C20.673.480.080'], ['C01.221.250.875.040', 'C01.221.812.640.400.040', 'C01.778.640.400.040', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.040', 'C01.925.813.400.040', 'C01.925.839.040', 'C20.673.480.040'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N02.278.421.660'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552'], ['Z01.107.567.875.350.530.530', 'Z01.107.567.875.500.530.530', 'Z01.433.741'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['C25.775', 'F03.900'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846.899', 'C01.748.939', 'C08.381.922', 'C08.730.939']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
27681,Diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted imaging for differentiating benign and malignant gallbladder lesions: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Although diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been characterized as an alternative imaging modality for gallbladder (GB) lesions, it has not been routinely used in clinical practice because of relatively low signal-to-noise ratio.PURPOSE: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic performance of DWI for differentiating benign and malignant GB lesions.STUDY TYPE: Meta-analysis.POPULATION: Patients with GB lesions.FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: DWI at 3.0T or 1.5T.ASSESSMENT: PubMed and EMBASE were searched following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Diagnostic Test Accuracy guidelines.STATISTICAL TESTS: Bivariate modeling and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) modeling were performed to compare the overall diagnostic performance of DWI. Subgroup analyses were performed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the DWI. Meta-regression analyses were performed according to the characteristics of the patients, study, and MRI.RESULTS: Eight studies (including 557 patients) were included. The DWI exhibited a pooled sensitivity of 91%, a pooled specificity of 87%, and HSROC of 0.95. In subgroup analyses, qualitative assessment (sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 87%; HSROC, 0.94) was more accurate than quantitative assessment (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 86 %; HSROC, 0.88). On meta-regression analysis, studies that used 3.0T field strength and thinner slices (?5 mm) reported a significantly higher sensitivity (P ? 0.02) than those using only 1.5T field strength and thicker slices (>5 mm).DATA CONCLUSION: DWI can discriminate malignant from benign GB lesions with excellent diagnostic performance in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. To enhance the diagnostic ability of DWI, images obtained with thinner slices (?5 mm) with 3T field strength and qualitative assessment are recommended.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J.

Sequence analysis revealed that the rice Vp1 gene (Osvp1) encodes a protein of 728 amino acids and is interupted by 5 introns at positions identical to those of the maize gene. Osvp1 transcript was detected in developing embryo as early as 10 days after flowering and decreased toward maturity. Osvp1 transcript was also detected in dry as well as imbided mature embryos.

40185,Cortisol metabolism in human obesity: impaired cortisone-->cortisol conversion in subjects with central adiposity.,"For a given body mass index (BMI), mortality is higher in patients with central compared to generalized obesity. Glucocorticoids play an important role in determining body fat distribution, but circulating cortisol concentrations are reported to be normal in obese patients. Our recent studies show enhanced conversion of inactive cortisone (E) to active cortisol (F) through the expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11betaHSD1) in cultured omental adipose stromal cells; the autocrine production of F may be a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of central obesity. We have now analyzed F metabolism in subjects with BMIs between 20-25 kg/m2 (group A), 25-30 kg/m2 (group B), and more than 30 kg/m2 (group C; n 12 in each group; six males and six premenopausal females; aged 23-44 yr). Glucose/insulin were measured using a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and each subject had total body and regional fat (scapular, waist, hip, and thigh) quantified using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Urinary total F metabolites (measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) were increased in subjects with obesity [group A, 11,176 +/- 1,530 microg/24 h (mean +/- SE); group C, 13,661 +/- 1,444], although not significantly so (P = 0.08). There was a significant reduction in the urinary tetrahydrocortisol (THF) +/- 5alpha-THF/tetrahydrocortisone (THE) and the cortol/cortolone ratio in obesity (group A vs. C, 1.06 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.04 and 0.41 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.34 +/- 0.03, respectively; both P < 0.05). Urinary free F (UFF) excretion was similar in all three groups, as was the UFF/urinary free E (UFE) ratio. The 0900 h circulating F, E, and ACTH pre- and postovernight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression values were similar in all three groups, but a reduction in the generation of serum F from dexamethasone-suppressed values after oral cortisone acetate (25 mg) was evident in both obese groups [e.g. 546 +/- 37 nmol/L in group A vs. 412 +/- 40 in group B (P < 0.05) and 388 +/- 38 in group C (P < 0.01) 180 min post-E]. Insulin resistance was present in groups B and C, but regression analysis revealed no relationship between F metabolites or the THF +/- 5alpha-THF/THE ratio and insulin action (homeostasis model assessment analysis and insulin values in the oral glucose tolerance test). There was, however, a highly significant relationship between the THF +/- 5alpha-THF/THE ratio and BMI (t = -3.44; P < 0.01) and total body fat (t = -2.27; P < 0.05). Stepwise regression analyses indicated an inverse relationship between THF+/-5alpha-THF/THE and scapular and waist fat (t = -2.25; P = 0.03) and a direct relationship with hip and thigh fat (t = 2.42; P = 0.02) in both sexes. The fall in the THF + 5alpha-THF/THE ratio but unchanged UFF/UFE ratio together with impaired F concentrations after oral E indicates inhibition of 11betaHSD1 in subjects with obesity. This results in an increased MCR for F, explaining the increased F secretion rate in obesity in the face of normal circulating F concentrations. 11BetaHSD1 activity is highly related to body fat distribution, with android or central obesity, but not gynoid obesity, associated with reduced activity in both sexes. This reduction in 11betaHSD1 activity raises new questions as to the primary role of 11betaHSD1 in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and central obesity.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Adult', 'Body Constitution', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cortisone', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Male', 'Obesity', 'Tetrahydrocortisol', 'Tetrahydrocortisone']",10084590,"[['A10.165.114'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.115', 'G07.100'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.183', 'D06.472.040.585.478.195'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['D04.210.500.745.887', 'D06.472.040.585.353.825', 'D06.472.040.585.478.782'], ['D04.210.500.745.558.783', 'D06.472.040.585.478.865']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

In this paper, we demonstrated a two-step spray-coating method for producing large-scale, smooth and flexible silver nanowire (AgNW)-poly3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) composite electrodes. Without the high-temperature annealing process, the conductivity of the composite film was improved via the lamination of highly conductive PEDOT:PSS modified by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Under the room temperature process condition, we fabricated the AgNW-PEDOT:PSS composite film showing an 84.3% mean optical transmittance with a 10.76 Ù sq(-1) sheet resistance. The figure of merit Ö(TC) was higher than that obtained from the indium tin oxide (ITO) films. The sheet resistance of the composite film slightly increased less than 5.3% during 200 cycles of tensile and compression folding, displaying good electromechanical flexibility for use in flexible optoelectronic applications.","['Adsorption', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrodes', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Hardness', 'Hot Temperature', 'Materials Testing', 'Metal Nanoparticles', 'Particle Size', 'Polystyrenes', 'Silver', 'Surface Properties', 'Thiophenes']",23241687,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['G01.358.500.249.277'], ['E07.305.250'], ['E05.320'], ['E05.325.192'], ['G01.374.647'], ['G01.906.595.543', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.380', 'G16.500.750.775.710.380', 'N06.230.300.100.725.232', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.380'], ['E05.570'], ['J01.637.512.600.500'], ['G02.712'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.150.750.800.830', 'D05.750.716.579', 'D25.720.716.579', 'J01.637.051.720.716.579'], ['D01.268.556.812', 'D01.268.956.843', 'D01.552.544.812'], ['G02.860'], ['D02.886.778', 'D03.383.903']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

17432,PGE2 involvement in experimental infection with Trypanosoma cruzi subpopulations.,"PGE2 involvement in experimental Trypanosoma cruzi infection depends on the lethal capacity of the parasite subpopulation used. Mice acutely infected with non-lethal K98 displayed an enhancement in PGE2 serum levels during the acute period, while those infected with lethal T. cruzi subpopulations (RA or K98-2) showed levels not different from normal mice. The enhancement detected in K98 group could be related both to an increased number of CD8+ T cell number and to enhanced PGE2 release per cell by CD8+; values of PGE2 release by adherent cells were not altered in this group. Treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors enhanced mortality rates of mice infected with K98, and administration of 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (dPGE) reversed this effect. However, mice infected with RA did not reduce their mortality rates by administration of diverse doses of dPGE. These findings suggest that PGE2 could play a role in resistance in mice infected with K98.","['16,16-Dimethylprostaglandin E2', 'Animals', 'Aspirin', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chagas Disease', 'Dinoprostone', 'Indomethacin', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Trypanosoma cruzi']",7652183,"[['D10.251.355.255.550.775.450.300', 'D23.469.050.175.725.775.450.300', 'D23.469.700.660.200'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595.176'], ['G04.022'], ['C01.610.752.300.900.200', 'C01.920.625'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.200'], ['D03.633.100.473.420'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595', 'E05.200.625.107.595', 'E05.242.195.107.595', 'G04.140.107.595', 'G09.188.105.595'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.388', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.388'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569'], ['B01.268.475.868.887.140']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

From January 1970 through March 1989, 45 patients at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center underwent splenectomy during the course of gynecologic laparotomies. All procedures were performed by the gynecology staff and trainees. Twenty-seven patients (60%) had ovarian cancer; endometrial and cervical cancers were present in three patients each. The remaining 11 patients had other diseases. Splenectomy was planned preoperatively in only 9 patients (20%). Thirteen patients (29%) underwent splenectomy because of injury to the spleen. Injury was most commonly due to traction during omentectomy, resulting in capsular laceration. The injury was immediately recognized in 12 patients; 1 patient required reexploration for hemoperitoneum. In 24 patients (53%), splenectomy was performed for tumor reduction. Pathologic examination showed that 11 of 24 patients had capsular involvement by tumor, 7 had parenchymal metastases, and 6 had no direct splenic involvement. Residual tumor following cytoreduction was smaller than 2 cm in 62.5% of patients. Splenectomy is a well-tolerated procedure and the operative approach can be tailored to the clinical situation and distribution of tumor.

1346,Intrarater reliability of neck strength measurement of rugby union players using a handheld dynamometer.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the isometric neck strength profiles of rugby union players and to assess the intrarater reliability of isometric neck strength measurement using a handheld dynamometer.METHODS: Twenty-five male, academy-level, rugby union players (forwards [n = 16], backs [n = 9]) were tested on 2 occasions during a training week 2 days apart. Isometric strength of the neck musculature was tested using a handheld dynamometer, for flexion (F), extension (E), left side flexion (LSF), and right side flexion (RSF). The average of 3 trials for each test position was used for statistical analysis. The following isometric neck strength values were obtained: F, E, F:E, LSF, RSF, LSF:RSF, and total isometric strength.RESULTS: Intrarater reliability intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.80 to 0.92 (intraclass correlation coefficient values: F, 0.85; E, 0.85; F:E, 0.85; LSF, 0.80; RSF, 0.85; LSF:RSF, 0.91; total isometric strength, 0.92), thus indicating excellent reliability in all instances. Forwards recorded significantly greater E scores compared with backs (637.10 ± 75.15 N vs 537.87 ± 82.25 N). Forwards also recoded significantly greater total isometric neck strength scores (2151.96 ± 231.11 N vs 1814.21 ± 211.26 N).CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide isometric neck strength values for the forward and back units in the rugby union and indicate that a handheld dynamometer may be a reliable tool for assessing isometric neck strength in this population.","['Athletic Injuries', 'Football', 'Hand', 'Humans', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Male', 'Muscle Strength', 'Muscle Strength Dynamometer', 'Neck Muscles', 'Observer Variation', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sampling Studies', 'Young Adult']",23845197,"[['C26.115'], ['I03.450.642.845.300'], ['A01.378.800.667'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G11.427.494.472'], ['E01.370.600.425', 'G11.427.560'], ['E07.230.460'], ['A02.633.567.650'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.372.875', 'N05.715.360.330.875', 'N06.850.520.450.875'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

4694,Two ears and two (or more?) devices: a pediatric case study of bilateral profound hearing loss.,"Advances in technology and expanding candidacy guidelines have motivated many clinics to consider children with precipitously sloping high-frequency hearing loss as candidates for cochlear implants (CIs). A case study is presented of a pediatric CI patient whose hearing thresholds were preserved within 10 dB of preimplant levels (125-750 Hz) after receiving a fully inserted 31.5-mm electrode array at one ear. The primary goal of this study was to explore the possible benefit of using both a hearing aid (HA) and a CI at one ear while using a HA at the opposite ear. The authors find that although the use of bilateral hearing aids with a CI may only provide a slight benefit, careful attention must be paid to the coordinated fitting of devices, especially at the ear with two devices.","['Audiometry', 'Auditory Pathways', 'Auditory Threshold', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Correction of Hearing Impairment', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing Loss, High-Frequency', 'Humans', 'Perceptual Masking', 'Persons With Hearing Impairments', 'Pitch Perception', 'Prosthesis Fitting', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sound Localization', 'Speech Perception', 'Treatment Outcome']",19447765,"[['E01.370.382.375.060'], ['A08.612.220.110'], ['F02.463.593.071.173', 'F02.463.593.710.190', 'G07.888.125.173'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E04.580.450.220', 'E04.650.220'], ['E07.305.250.319.381.500.500', 'E07.695.150', 'E07.695.202.381.500.500', 'E07.814.458.150'], ['E02.186'], ['E02.760.169.063.500.200', 'E02.831.200', 'H02.403.680.600.500', 'N02.421.784.377'], ['F01.470'], ['E07.305.906.500', 'E07.814.458'], ['C09.218.458.341.812', 'C10.597.751.418.341.812', 'C23.888.592.763.393.341.812'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.593.071.594', 'F02.463.593.932.733', 'G07.888.125.594'], ['M01.150.750'], ['F02.463.593.071.700', 'G07.888.125.700'], ['E02.794'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['F02.463.593.071.869', 'G07.888.125.869'], ['F02.463.593.071.875', 'G07.888.125.875'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

In every stage of his work a doctor should be ready to pick up signs of possible scientific progress. Being constantly attentive and able to see anything new occurring, however difficult it may be to discern, should remain the basis of any professional commitment that takes care not to become sterile and thereby less effective in treating disease. A doctor is an experimenter par excellence, one who constantly applies experimental methods based on his own ''historical'' knowledge, experience, and capacity to comprehend even the tiniest signals that reach him from the real world. On the other hand, although the indiscriminate acceptance of results obtained by clinical trials and the increasing recourse to technology could herald the end of clinical freedom, we believe that such recourse to technology is, in fact, desirable. The reason for this belief is that a lack of innovation leads to loss of enthusiasm and loss of interest in specific clinical problems; it also results in a cultural attitude that refutes the notion of experimental logic being inherent in any treatment because of the changeability of individual conditions on a biological, clinical, and psycho-relational level.","['Clinical Medicine', 'Physicians']",18034410,"[['H02.403.200'], ['M01.526.485.810', 'N02.360.810']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

At the end of the experiment, the young were injected intraperitoneally with 1 muCi 131I. One hour later they were decapitated and the radioactivity in their thyroid was expressed as the percentage of the administered dose per mg thyroid. The following age groups were used, according to the interval between thyroidectomy and decapitation: 4 to 8, 9 to 13, 13 to 15 and 15 to 17 days. 131I uptake by the residue of the thyroid in partially thyroidectomized animals was always compared with the values in the animals from the same litter subjected to sham operation. The results showed that partial thyroidectomy significantly stimulated 131I uptake in all age groups in which the mother was only given saline. In the 4- to 8-day-old group, the administration of 50 or 100 mug thyroxine to the mother inhibited this compensatory increase. In the 9- to 13-day-old group, inhibition occurred only after a dose of 100 mug thyroxine. In animals with an interval from the 13th to the 15th days old the dose of thyroxine administered to the mother had to be raised to 200 mug/day to achieve an inhibitory effect. In the last group (interval 15th to 17th day), not even administration of the maximum thyroxine dose to the mother from the 13th postnatal day succeeded in inhibiting the significant increase in 131I uptake. These results show that thyroxine administered to lactating female rats can be transmitted via the milk to the organism of the young in amounts which can be demonstrated in a physiological tests.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Female', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroidectomy', 'Thyroxine']",128011,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['D01.268.380.400.500.496', 'D01.496.448.496', 'D01.496.749.474'], ['G08.686.784.769.455'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['A06.300.900'], ['E04.270.856'], ['D06.472.931.812', 'D12.125.072.050.767']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
42304,"Safe from harm: learned, instructed, and symbolic generalization pathways of human threat-avoidance.","Avoidance of threatening or unpleasant events is usually an adaptive behavioural strategy. Sometimes, however, avoidance can become chronic and lead to impaired daily functioning. Excessive threat-avoidance is a central diagnostic feature of anxiety disorders, yet little is known about whether avoidance acquired in the absence of a direct history of conditioning with a fearful event differs from directly learned avoidance. In the present study, we tested whether avoidance acquired indirectly via verbal instructions and symbolic generalization result in similar levels of avoidance behaviour and threat-beliefs to avoidance acquired after direct learning. Following fear conditioning in which one conditioned stimulus was paired with shock (CS+) and another was not (CS-), participants either learned or were instructed to make a response that cancelled impending shock. Three groups were then tested with a learned CS+ and CS- (learned group), instructed CS+ (instructed group), and generalized CS+ (derived group) presentations. Results showed similar levels of avoidance behaviour and threat-belief ratings about the likelihood of shock across each of the three pathways despite the different mechanisms by which they were acquired. Findings have implications for understanding the aetiology of clinical avoidance in anxiety.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Conditioning, Classical', 'Conditioning, Psychological', 'Fear', 'Female', 'Generalization, Psychological', 'Humans', 'Learning', 'Male']",23077631,"[['F01.058'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F03.080'], ['F02.463.425.179.308'], ['F02.463.425.179'], ['F01.470.361'], ['F02.463.425.357'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425', 'F02.784.629.529']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
3751,Epigenotoxicity of environmental pollutants evaluated by a combination of DNA methylation inhibition and capillary electrophoresis-laser-induced fluorescence immunoassay.,"A variety of environmental pollutants may cause abnormal DNA methylation, which further disturb gene expression. In this work, we developed a rapid and sensitive method for the characterization and identification of the epigenotoxicity of environmental pollutants in terms of DNA methylation. The method combines in vitro inhibition reactions of a model DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) with rapid and sensitive capillary electrophoresis-laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) immunoassays. This method was first assessed using two known DNMT inhibitors, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and RG108, and then applied to epigenotoxic evaluation of four aldehydes and six benzo-1,4-quinones. It was found that all these electrophilic chemicals could inhibit DNMT activity, probably due to their interactions with the active sites of DNMT. Interestingly, benzo-1,4-quinones displayed more inhibitory effects on DNMT activity than aldehydes. Among the tested six benzo-1,4-quinones, halogenated benzo-1,4-quinone showed higher inhibitory activity than non-halogenated p-benzo-1,4-quinone. Owing to its speed and sensitivity, our method will be potentially applicable for fast epigenotoxic screening of environmental pollutants and mechanistic study of environmental epigenetics.","['DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Immunoassay']",23377082,"[['D13.444.308'], ['G02.111.035.538.161', 'G02.111.218', 'G03.059.538.161', 'G05.206'], ['D08.811.150.240', 'D08.811.913.555.500.350'], ['E05.196.401.190', 'E05.301.300.190'], ['D27.888.284'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['E05.478.566', 'E05.601.470']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5447,DNAc: A clustering method for identifying kinship relations between DNA profiles using a novel similarity measure.,"After decades of refinement, DNA testing methods have become essential tools in forensic sciences. They are essentially based on likelihood ratio test principle, which is utilized specifically, by using as prior knowledge the allele frequencies in the population, to confirm or refute a given kinship hypothesis made on two genotypes. This makes these methods ill suited when allele frequencies or kinship hypotheses are unavailable. In this paper, we introduce DNAc, a new clustering methodology for DNA testing based on a new similarity measure that allows an accurate retrieval of the degree of relatedness among two or more genotypes, without relying on kinship hypotheses or allele frequencies in the population. We used DNAc in analyzing microsatellite DNA sequences distributed among 12 genotypes from normal individuals from two distinct families. The results show that DNAc accurately determines kinship among genotypes and further gathers them in the appropriate kinship groups.","['Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Paternity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",21077874,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['E05.318.740.600.200', 'N05.715.360.750.625.150', 'N06.850.520.830.600.200'], ['E05.318.740.225.500.500', 'E05.393.290', 'I01.198.780.937.375', 'N04.452.910.099.750'], ['G05.330'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.340.024.850.500'], ['I01.198.780.937.766'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['E05.393.760.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
25135,Diagnosis of gallbladder dyskinesia by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy.,"AIM: The aim of the present study was to develop a new pharmacologic method during hepatobiliary scintigraphy by which patients with functional and organic forms of gallbladder (GB) dysfunction can be differentiated.METHODS: Quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy (QHBS) was performed on 31 patients with impaired GB motility selected by cerulein-augmented ultrasonography. Nineteen patients had acalculous biliary pain (ABP) and suspected GB dyskinesia, 6 patients had celiac disease, and 6 patients had type II diabetes mellitus. Sixty minutes after the isotope administration, 1 ng/bwkg/min cerulein (CCK10) was infused for 10 minutes, and then from the 90th minute, an equivalent dose of CCK10 was infused in the presence of 0.5 mg sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in 12 or placebo in 7 consecutive patients. The GB ejection fraction (GBEF) was calculated repeatedly in time periods from 60 to 90 and from 90 to 120 minutes.RESULTS: In the majority of patients with ABP and suspected GB dyskinesia, CCK10 and GTN coadministration normalized the previously impaired GB-emptying. When the cumulative results of all 12 patients were calculated, we demonstrated significant differences (P=0.003) in the GBEF between the first (CCK10) versus the second (CCK10 plus GTN) stimuli: 19+/-11% versus 40+/-17%, respectively. In contrast, in 12 patients with celiac sprue and diabetes mellitus, no differences in the GBEF were detected when the first (CCK10 alone) versus the second (CCK10 plus GTN) stimuli was compared: 21+/-10% versus 22+/-13%, respectively. Finally, placebo and CCK10 coadministration in 7 consecutive patients with ABP and suspected GB dyskinesia did not influence the GBEF as compared with CCK10 alone: 13+/-9% versus 15+/-10%, respectively.CONCLUSION: GTN and CCK10 coadministration induces a significant improvement of the GBEF in patients with GB dyskinesia. The application of this new pharmacologic test during QHBS permitted the noninvasive separation of those patients with secondary impaired GB-emptying as a result of GB dyskinesia from those with primary forms of GB hypokinesia.","['Biliary Dyskinesia', 'Biliary Tract', 'Ceruletide', 'Female', 'Gallbladder', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitroglycerin', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Technetium Tc 99m Diethyl-iminodiacetic Acid']",15827396,"[['C06.130.120.250.098'], ['A03.159'], ['D12.644.456.241'], ['A03.159.439'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.158.600', 'E01.370.350.350', 'L01.313.500.750.100.158.600'], ['A03.620'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.640.636'], ['E01.370.350.710', 'E01.370.384.730'], ['D27.505.259.843', 'D27.505.519.871', 'D27.720.470.410.650'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['D02.241.081.583.400', 'D02.491.485.400', 'D02.691.825.445', 'D12.125.072.401.830']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
31400,Management of malignant bowel obstruction with decompression tubes.,"OBJECTIVE: To build a quantitative assessment system for normative cancer pain management.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups of 60 patients with malignant lower bowel obstruction were formed: the study group (n=30) patients receiving routine small intestinal decompression and enteral nutrition, and the control group (n=30) patients receiving nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition. The weight, protein indicators and occurrence of complications in the two groups were compared during the treatment.RESULTS: The weight gain, increase of albumin and prealbumin, and complication rate were (1.9667 ± 1.38298) kg, (2.9133 ± 1.38258) g/L, (18.5333 ± 10.92840) mg/L and 26.67% in the study group compared with (0.6667±0.87428) kg, (1.5500 ± 0.72099) g/L, (12.9333 ± 8.47688) mg/L and 86.67% in the control group. There were statistically significant differences (t = -4,352,-4.789, -2.218; ÷2 = 21.9910; p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: The application of small bowel decompression tubes can improve the nutritional status, physical fitness, reduce complications in patients with malignant lower intestinal obstruction.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Decompression, Surgical', 'Enteral Nutrition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestine, Small', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutritional Status', 'Pain Management', 'Parenteral Nutrition', 'Weight Gain']",25339472,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E04.188'], ['E02.421.360', 'E02.642.500.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.405.469.531'], ['A03.556.124.684'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['E02.745', 'N04.590.607.500'], ['E02.421.505', 'E02.642.500.505'], ['C23.888.144.243.926', 'G07.345.249.314.120.200.926']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
38096,Examination of the thoracic cavity and lung lobectomy by means of thoracoscopy in dogs.,"The feasibility of thoracoscopy for viewing the chest cavity and performing pulmonary lobectomy was assessed in 8 mongrel dogs. Previously, selective intubation had been performed in another group of dogs (n = 8) in order to monitor respiratory physiology and assess its safety. Each hemithorax was intubated using a double-barrelled endotracheal tube with one barrel placed in the left main bronchus and the other in the bifurcation of the trachea. The thoracoscope was introduced through a cannula inserted through a 2-cm incision at the ventral third of the left 5th intercostal space. The cranial, dorsal, and caudal surfaces of the pleura, lobes of the left lung, and the mediastinum were examined. A 2nd cannula was located in the dorsal 3rd of the 5th intercostal space with a prior incision and used for the introduction of forceps to separate the viscera. To biopsy, a 3rd cannula was inserted at the dorsal third of the 8th intercostal space with a prior incision, through which a 12-mm diameter stapler was introduced. Should a lobectomy be necessary, a 4th cannula is located in the middle third of the 4th intercostal space. Excision of the left caudal pulmonary lobe was performed through the incision made for the 12-mm diameter cannula (8th intercostal space); a twisting movement facilitated removal. Thoracoscopy is a procedure that can be used in dogs and is particularly suitable for examination, collection of biopsy specimens, and even lung lobectomies.","['Anesthesia, General', 'Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Dogs', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Hemoglobins', 'Intubation, Intratracheal', 'Lung', 'Oxygen', 'Sutures', 'Thoracoscopy']",9592615,"[['E03.155.197'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['D12.776.124.400', 'D12.776.422.316.762'], ['E02.041.500', 'E02.585.578', 'E05.497.578'], ['A04.411'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['E07.858.690.820'], ['E01.370.388.250.840', 'E04.502.250.840', 'E04.928.752']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

48640,"Manipulation of two á-endo-â-1,4-glucanase genes, AtCel6 and GmCel7, reduces susceptibility to Heterodera glycines in soybean roots.","Plant endo-â-1,4-glucanases (EGases) include cell wall-modifying enzymes that are involved in nematode-induced growth of syncytia (feeding structures) in nematode-infected roots. EGases in the á- and â-subfamilies contain signal peptides and are secreted, whereas those in the ã-subfamily have a membrane-anchoring domain and are not secreted. The Arabidopsis á-EGase At1g48930, designated as AtCel6, is known to be down-regulated by beet cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii) in Arabidopsis roots, whereas another á-EGase, AtCel2, is up-regulated. Here, we report that the ectopic expression of AtCel6 in soybean roots reduces susceptibility to both soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines) and root knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita). Suppression of GmCel7, the soybean homologue of AtCel2, in soybean roots also reduces the susceptibility to SCN. In contrast, in studies on two ã-EGases, both ectopic expression of AtKOR2 in soybean roots and suppression of the soybean homologue of AtKOR3 had no significant effect on SCN parasitism. Our results suggest that secreted á-EGases are likely to be more useful than membrane-bound ã-EGases in the development of an SCN-resistant soybean through gene manipulation. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that Arabidopsis shares molecular events of cyst nematode parasitism with soybean, and confirms the suitability of the Arabidopsis-H. schachtii interaction as a model for the soybean-H. glycines pathosystem.","['Animals', 'Cellulose', 'Disease Resistance', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Diseases', 'Plant Roots', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Soybeans', 'Tylenchoidea']",24844661,"[['B01.050'], ['D05.750.078.562.180', 'D09.698.365.180', 'D25.720.099.500', 'J01.637.051.720.099.500'], ['C23.550.291.671', 'G12.450.564.250', 'G12.450.800.250', 'G15.630.250'], ['C23.550.291.687', 'G07.100.250'], ['G05.308.375'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.393', 'G05.360.340.365.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G15.610'], ['A18.400'], ['B01.650.520', 'B05.620.600'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.401.750'], ['B01.050.500.500.294.400.984.825']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

However, in more longstanding infections, considerably larger populations of minor VATs are required to stimulate an effective immune response. As a result, larger populations of minor VATs evade immune detection and, following a decrease in parasitaemia, become part of the relapse population.

Activation of the URA3, MEL1, and lacZ reporters in response to a protein-protein interaction is monitored by measuring sequentially: (i) growth in medium lacking uracil, (ii) alpha-galactosidase activity, and (iii) beta-galactosidase. The data thus generated permit elimination of many false positive signals and provide a preliminary measurement of reporter activation-strength that may be confirmed by further analysis. The assay procedure is inexpensive and requires few liquid-handling steps. It is appropriate for automated high-throughput interaction mating assays, validation of putative interactor strains and hybrid-protein self-activator tests.","['Fungal Proteins', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Yeasts']",15560140,"[['D12.776.354'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.435'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E05.393.220.870', 'E05.601.690.650', 'E05.601.870'], ['B01.300.930']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

1979,Antioxidant compounds EGB-761 and BN-52021 attenuate brain edema formation and hemeoxygenase expression following hyperthermic brain injury in the rat.,"Role of carbon monoxide (CO) in hyperthermic brain injury induced brain pathology was examined in a rat model using immunohistochemistry of the hemeoxygenase-2 (HO-2) enzyme. Exposure of rats to 4 h heat stress at 38 degrees C resulted in profound hyperthermia, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), brain edema formation, cell damage and expression of HO-2 in several brain regions. Pretreatment with potent antioxidant compounds EGB-761 and BN-52021 markedly reduced the HO-2 expression, BBB breakdown, brain edema formation and cell damage without attenuating the hyperthermic response. This effect was most marked in animals treated with EGB-761. These observations suggest that upregulation of HO-2 representing generation of CO plays important roles in hyperthermic brain injury, and oxidative stress seems to be one of the most important signals in inducing HO-2 expression in hyperthermia, not reported earlier.","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Capillary Permeability', 'Diterpenes', 'Fever', 'Ginkgo biloba', 'Ginkgolides', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)', 'Hot Temperature', 'Lactones', 'Male', 'Plant Extracts', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Stress, Physiological']",14753460,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['A07.035', 'A08.186.211.035'], ['C10.228.140.187'], ['C10.228.140.199', 'C10.900.300.087', 'C26.915.300.200'], ['G03.143.330', 'G09.330.165'], ['D02.455.849.291'], ['C23.888.119.344'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.125'], ['D02.455.849.291.400'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.410'], ['G01.906.595.543', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.380', 'G16.500.750.775.710.380', 'N06.230.300.100.725.232', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.380'], ['D02.540'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['G07.775']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

15943,Syringes versus Chinese cups in harvesting suction-induced blister graft: a randomized split-body study.,"BACKGROUND: Suction blister grafting (SBG) is a technique where the pigmented epidermis is harvested from the donor site by induction of a blister using different suction methods as syringes, Chinese cups, suction device, etc. However, pain, time consumption, incomplete blister formation, and failure of blister development are the main limitations.OBJECTIVE: To compare between cups and syringes of similar diameter in inducing suction blisters.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 30 patients with stable nonsegmental vitiligo, 2-cm-diameter (20 ml) syringe was applied on the anterolateral aspect of one thigh and a 2-cm-diameter cup on the corresponding site of the other thigh where right and left sides were chosen randomly. Patients were observed untill complete blister development or for a maximum of 3 hours. Suction blister induction time (SBIT) and the blister diameter were recorded for each patient. Pain during the process of induction was evaluated.RESULTS: Incomplete blister development was noted in 9 out of 30 (30%) with 2 cm syringes and 6 out of 30 (20%) with the similar diameter cups with no significant difference (P = 0.49). No significant difference was found between SBIT induced by the 2 cm syringes and the similar size cups (101.17 ± 68.14 minutes, 98 ± 56.84 minutes, respectively) (P = 0.85). Meanwhile, blister diameter induced by either syringe or cup was not significantly different (P = 0.37). Anesthesia was for short duration with xylocaine, and pain was intolerable in both sides in the first seven patients. A combination of xylocaine and bupivacaine was used with prolonged loss of pain in 17 of the remaining 23 patients and tolerable pain in six patients similarly in both sides.CONCLUSION: According to present results, the differences in SIBT, diameter of blisters, and number of complete blister formation induced by either syringes or cups of similar size were not significant. Therefore, whatever the available and feasible technique for the surgeon will be the ideal choice. A combination of xylocaine and bupivacaine is recommended to overcome the accompanying pain of the procedure.","['Adult', 'Anesthesia, Local', 'Anesthetics, Local', 'Blister', 'Bupivacaine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lidocaine', 'Male', 'Pain', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Suction', 'Syringes', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting', 'Vitiligo']",29797713,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E03.155.086.231'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['C17.800.865.187', 'C23.300.122'], ['D02.065.199.239', 'D02.092.146.113.239'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.065.199.092.500', 'D02.092.146.113.092.500'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['E02.095.147.725.700', 'E04.680.275.850', 'E04.936.580.700'], ['E04.237.890'], ['E07.877'], ['E04.936.537'], ['C17.800.621.440.895']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
19659,Underexpression and abnormal localization of ATM products in ataxia telangiectasia patients bearing ATM missense mutations.,"Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immune defects and predisposition to malignancies. A-T is caused by biallelic inactivation of the ATM gene, in most cases by frameshift or nonsense mutations. More rarely, ATM missense mutations with unknown consequences on ATM function are found, making definitive diagnosis more challenging. In this study, a series of 15 missense mutations, including 11 not previously reported, were identified in 16 patients with clinical diagnosis of A-T belonging to 14 families and 1 patient with atypical clinical features. ATM function was evaluated in patient lymphoblastoid cell lines by measuring H2AX and KAP1 phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation, confirming the A-T diagnosis for 16 cases. In accordance with previous studies, we showed that missense mutations associated with A-T often lead to ATM protein underexpression (15 out of 16 cases). In addition, we demonstrated that most missense mutations lead to an abnormal cytoplasmic localization of ATM, correlated with its decreased expression. This new finding highlights ATM mislocalization as a new mechanism of ATM dysfunction, which may lead to therapeutic strategies for missense mutation associated A-T.","['Ataxia Telangiectasia', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Transport', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",22071889,"[['C10.228.140.252.190.530.060', 'C10.562.100', 'C10.597.350.090.500.530.060', 'C14.907.823.213', 'C16.320.080', 'C16.320.798.250', 'C18.452.284.060', 'C20.673.795.250'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.097', 'D12.776.157.687.125', 'D12.776.660.720.125'], ['D12.776.167'], ['A11.251.210'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G05.297'], ['D12.776.157.687.485', 'D12.776.660.720.485', 'D12.776.664.469'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['G05.365.590.650'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['G03.143.700'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D12.776.624.776']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
47338,Dichotic listening tests in studying brain-behavior relationships.,"The magnitude of perceptual asymmetry (PA) on a CVC fused dichotic words test and on VCV and CV fused nonsense syllables tests were compared. In each test the set of distinguishing phonemic cues was the same; the six English stop consonants, b,p,d,t,g,k. Although test-retest reliability was very high on all three tests there was no correlation across individuals between the degrees of PA on different tests. Moreover, the magnitude of PA on the VCV nonsense test increased as field dependence (FD) increased on the field dependence index (FDI) of the WAIS while there was no relationship between FD and the magnitude of PA on the CVC words test. In addition, concurrent visual tasks increased PA on the VCV nonsense test and decreased it on the words test. In order to facilitate the use of such data, Kimura's classical model of the physiological basis of PA is modified by including components of primary receptive and secondary and tertiary associative function. Comparison of highly similar PA measures, that differ in specific ways, is discussed as a means of collecting data for mapping cerebral functional space and exploring brain-behavior relationships.","['Adult', 'Cues', 'Dichotic Listening Tests', 'Dominance, Cerebral', 'Female', 'Field Dependence-Independence', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Neurological', 'Phonetics', 'Psychoacoustics', 'Speech Perception', 'Wechsler Scales']",4033907,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F02.463.425.234'], ['E01.370.382.375.200'], ['F02.830.297', 'G11.561.225'], ['F02.463.593.343'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.599.395.642'], ['L01.559.598.518'], ['E01.370.382.375.060.530', 'E01.370.685.628', 'F04.096.753.628'], ['F02.463.593.071.875', 'G07.888.125.875'], ['F04.711.141.493.822']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

The system has been tested through a preliminary survey that took place in UK and Greece.","['Asthma', 'Disease Management', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Telemedicine']",15747901,"[['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['N04.590.607'], ['I02.233.332.445', 'N02.421.726.407.579'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.230.110.500'], ['I02.233.332.500', 'N02.421.726.407.680'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['H02.403.840', 'L01.178.847.652', 'N04.590.374.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0
38246,Relationships between strategy switching and strategy switch costs in young and older adults: a study in arithmetic problem solving.,"UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND/STUDY CONTEXT: This study investigated age-related differences in within-item strategy switching (i.e., revising initial strategy choices to select a better strategy while solving a given problem) and in strategy switch costs (i.e., longer latencies when participants switch strategies than when they do not switch strategy during strategy execution).METHODS: In a computational estimation task, participants had to give approximate products to two-digit multiplication problems (e.g., 41?67) while rounding up (i.e., do 50?70 for 41?67) or rounding down (i.e., do 40?60 for 41?67) operands to their nearest decades. After executing a cued strategy during 1000 ms, participants had the possibility to switch to another strategy (or repeat the same strategy) in a selection condition. In an execution condition, participants were forced to repeat the same strategy or to switch to another strategy.RESULTS: It was found that (1) older adults were less able than young adults to switch strategy after starting to execute a cued strategy (36.1% vs. 45.8%); (2) older adults showed larger switch costs than young adults (422 vs. 223 ms); and (3) strategy switches and strategy switch costs correlated in older adults but not in young adults.CONCLUSION: These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying within-item strategy switching and aging effects on these mechanisms as well as, more generally, of strategic variations during cognitive aging.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Executive Function', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mathematics', 'Middle Aged', 'Problem Solving', 'Young Adult']",25724013,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G07.345.124'], ['F02.463.217'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H01.548'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F02.463.425.725', 'F02.463.785.810'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

24592,Effects of cyclosporin A immunosuppression on pancreaticoduodenal transplantation in alloxan-diabetic rats.,"1. Forty-five outbred Wistar rats were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: GI, 10 non-diabetic control rats; GII, 10 alloxan-diabetic control rats; GIII, 25 alloxan-diabetic rats which received pancreaticoduodenal transplantation (PDT) from normal Wistar donor rats and were immunosuppressed with cyclosporin A (Cy-A), 10 mg kg body weight-1 day-1, administered intraperitoneally for 30 days. 2. In parallel, 15 alloxan-diabetic inbred Wistar rats received isogeneic PDT from normal Wistar donor rats. 3. Cy-A prevented graft rejection in the 15 surviving animals in group III. These observations were confirmed by clinical and biochemical parameters (body weight, urine output, water and food intake, blood and urinary glucose and plasma insulin) and by histology and immunohistochemistry of the pancreas. 4. However, Cy-A was associated with 60% of the infectious complications in transplanted rats leading to 40% mortality. Pulmonary infections were the main cause of death. There were no side effects of immunosuppression on the pancreas. Infections were not significant in inbred rats submitted to PDT.","['Animals', 'Cyclosporine', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Duodenum', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppression', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation', 'Male', 'Pancreas', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Time Factors']",1341913,"[['B01.050'], ['D04.345.566.235.300', 'D12.644.641.235.300'], ['C18.452.394.750.074', 'C19.246.240', 'E05.598.500.374'], ['E05.290.625', 'E05.337.425'], ['A03.556.124.684.124', 'A03.556.875.249'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E02.095.465.425.450', 'E05.478.610'], ['E02.095.147.500.250', 'E04.270.550', 'E04.936.225.375'], ['A03.734'], ['E05.318.370.700', 'E05.581.500.805', 'N05.715.360.325.675', 'N06.850.520.445.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
26624,An ab initio theoretical study of the stereoisomers of tetrahydrocannabinols.,"An extensive theoretical study of the stereoisomers of tetrahydrocannabinols has been performed at the ab initio HF/6-31G* and B3LYP/6-31G* levels. Effects of solvation were calculated with the Onsager model (with full geometry optimization), SCRF with Tomasi's PCM, and isodensity polarization continuum models. Single-point MP2//HF/6-31G* calculations were carried out. Frequency calculations for all the isomers at the HF/6-31G* level and for two natural isomers delta1-THC-RR and delta6-THC-RR at the B3LYP/6-31G* level were performed. Our results support the findings of the previous AM1 studies that the orientation of the carbocyclic ring and its C1 substituent with respect to the phenyl group hydroxyl oxygen play the major role in the activity. The calculated values of the LUMO energy (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) and the hardness of the stereoisomers show that for the trans isomers it is easier to remove one electron from its HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) to the LUMO and easier to accept an electron from the receptor binding site than for the cis isomers. Combining geometric features (the orientation of the carbocyclic ring and its C1 substituent with respect to the phenyl group hydroxyl oxygen) with electronic features (LUMO and hardness), we explain the activity differences among the stereoisomers.","['Computer Simulation', 'Dronabinol', 'Models, Molecular', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Thermodynamics']",11349815,"[['L01.224.160'], ['D02.455.849.090.810'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G02.607.445.682'], ['G01.906']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
33531,Soldier morphogenesis in the damp-wood termite is regulated by the insulin signaling pathway.,"Eusocial insects exhibit various morphological castes associated with the division of labor within a colony. Termite soldiers possess defensive traits including mandibles that are greatly exaggerated and enlarged, as compared to termite reproductives and workers. The enlarged mandibles of soldiers are known to result from dynamic morphogenesis during soldier differentiation that can be induced by juvenile hormone and its analogs. However, the detailed developmental mechanisms still remain unresolved. Because the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway has been shown to regulate the relative sizes of organs (i.e., allometry) in other insects, we examined the expression profiles of major IIS factors in the damp-wood termite Hodotermopsis sjostedti, during soldier differentiation. The relative expression patterns of orthologs for termite InR (HsjInR), PKB/Akt (HsjPKB/Akt), and FOXO (HsjFOXO) suggest that HsjInR and HsjPKB/Akt were up-regulated in the period of elongation of mandibles during soldier development. In situ hybridization showed that HsjInR was strongly expressed in the mandibular epithelial tissues, and RNA interference (RNAi) for HsjInR disrupted soldier-specific morphogenesis including mandibular elongation. These results suggest that signaling through the IIS pathway is required for soldier-specific morphogenesis. In addition, up-regulation of the IIS pathway in other body tissues occurred at earlier stages of development, indicating that there is tissue-specific IIS regulation. Because the IIS pathway is generally thought to act upstream of JH in insects, our results suggest the damp-wood termite may have evolved a novel feedback loop between JH and IIS that enables social interactions, rather than nutrition, to regulate caste determination.","['Animals', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Insulin', 'Isoptera', 'Juvenile Hormones', 'Morphogenesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wood']",23703784,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670.325', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670.325', 'E05.200.500.620.670.325', 'E05.200.750.600.670.325', 'E05.393.661.475'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.485'], ['D06.472.445.573.666'], ['G07.345.500'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A18.450.500.500', 'J01.637.241.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
48884,Complex-irreversibility and evolution.,"Both, irreversibility and evolution, imply order in time. It is argued that the only possible concept of time is a 'system-specific time', and that order in time is convertible into order in space and vice-versa. While life-less, complex systems are irreversible because of their complexity and, hence, not repeatable, living systems are reproduced by irreversible copy-reproduction and by coding. This mode of reproduction results of necessity in an arrow of time of growth and increasing complexity with death as its antagonist, and in obligatory spatial asymmetry. This arrow of increasing organic complexity is simultaneous with, and independent of, the arrow of increasing entropy. - A generalized, organic hierarchy is proposed as the model to study higher evolution. This hierarchy reproduces itself by differential rates of reproduction of its subunits within and between the various hierarchical levels of organization. Phylogenetic change is brought about by a change in this hierarchy's specific phase pattern of growth. Continuous and discrete organization is defined, and it is shown that specific relations between continuous and discrete levels within the hierarchy result in accumulation of neutral alleles. This accumulation is due to complex-irreversibility and causes genetic stabilisation, i.e. heritability, of the species-specific morphology of organisms.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Single-Stranded', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Models, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",6873230,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.045', 'G16.075'], ['G02.111.225', 'G05.226'], ['D13.444.308.497', 'G02.111.570.820.486.437', 'G05.360.580.437'], ['G05.360.335'], ['G05.365'], ['E05.599.395.397'], ['G02.111.570.080.708', 'G05.360.080.708']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
29986,A quality-control program for colposcopic practice.,"Quality control is accepted as an integral part of the cytology laboratory's activities. However, provision of similar safeguards for colposcopic practice in assessing patients with abnormal cervical cytology has been an elusive problem. This report describes the quality-control program for colposcopy that is used province-wide in British Columbia for 21 hospital-based clinics staffed by 35 colposcopists. Copies of the results of all colposcopic examinations performed are sent to the Central Cytology Laboratory where the program is coordinated and the data are collated, analyzed, and evaluated. These data are used to set standards against which each colposcopist's performance and activity can be measured. One of the quality-control indicators used is a comparison between the colposcopic impression of the lesion and the corresponding direct biopsy diagnosis. Correlation within one histologic degree occurred in 86% of patients examined; this information was used to set a performance standard of 80% as the quality-control index for this particular indicator. Three colposcopists had scores below this standard. Comparisons were also made between presenting cytology, directed biopsy results, initial colposcopic impression, and final colposcopic evaluation (the clinical working diagnosis). The other major aspect of the quality-control program consists of an analysis of all cases of diagnosed invasive cervical cancer in the province in a given year to determine whether any colposcopically related errors occurred in the investigation and management of these cases. This system helps to identify individuals who may benefit from additional training.","['Biopsy', 'British Columbia', 'Carcinoma', 'Colposcopy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Laboratories, Hospital', 'Quality Control', 'Uterine Cervical Diseases', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms']",1923214,"[['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['Z01.107.567.176.160'], ['C04.557.470.200'], ['E01.370.378.150', 'E01.370.388.250.150', 'E04.502.250.150', 'E04.520.150', 'E04.950.300.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.420', 'N02.278.487.410', 'N04.452.442.452.422.420'], ['J01.897.608'], ['C13.351.500.852.593'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.850', 'C13.351.500.852.593.131', 'C13.351.500.852.762.850', 'C13.351.937.418.875.850']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1

8240,Case series on acute HCV in HIV-negative men in regular clinical practice: a call for action.,"BACKGROUND: The evidence that HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) reduces the risk of HIV transmission is overwhelming. But as PrEP and TasP can lead to increased sexual mixing between HIV positive and negative men who have sex with men (MSM), sexually transmitted infections such as acute hepatitis C (HCV), which were thought to be limited to HIV-infected MSM, could become more frequent in HIV uninfected MSM as well. The objective of this study was to describe a series of cases of sexually transmitted HCV infections in HIV-uninfected MSM in the Netherlands and Belgium.METHODS: Through the Dutch Acute HCV in HIV Study (a Dutch-Belgian prospective multicentre study on the treatment of acute HCV infection, NCT02600325) and the Be-PrEP-ared study (a PrEP project in Antwerp, EudraCT2015-000054-37) several acute HCV infections were detected in HIV-negative men.RESULTS: A newly acquired HCV infection was diagnosed in ten HIV-negative MSM. HCV was diagnosed at a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic (n = 2), by their general practitioner (n = 2), by their HIV physician (n = 1) or at a PrEP clinic (n = 5). Ten patients reported unprotected anal intercourse and four had a concomitant STI at the time of HCV diagnosis. Six patients reported using drugs during sex.CONCLUSIONS: Our observation calls for a larger nationwide epidemiological study on the prevalence, incidence and risk factors of HCV infection in HIV-uninfected MSM. In the changing landscape of TasP and PrEP, reliable and up-to-date epidemiological data on HCV among HIV-uninfected MSM are needed and will help in developing evidence-based testing policies.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Belgium', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Homosexuality, Male', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Netherlands', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral', 'Unsafe Sex']",30362948,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['Z01.542.115'], ['E05.318.372.250.250', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250'], ['B04.820.650.589.650.350'], ['G12.400'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['F01.145.802.975.500.600', 'G08.686.867.500.600'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.802'], ['M01.777'], ['C01.221.812.640', 'C01.778.640', 'C01.925.813', 'C23.550.291.531.937.640'], ['F01.145.802.987']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

9264,Intravenous amifostine during chemoradiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer: a randomized placebo-controlled phase III study.,"PURPOSE: Clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy and safety of intravenous (i.v.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) amifostine for reducing xerostomia and mucositis after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy for head-and-neck cancer. This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of i.v. amifostine during radiochemotherapy for head-and-neck cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients from European and American study centers received i.v. amifostine 300 mg/m2 (n = 67) or placebo (n = 65) before carboplatin 70 mg/m2 and radiotherapy on Days 1 to 5 and 21 to 25, and i.v. amifostine 200 mg/m2 or placebo before radiotherapy on other days.RESULTS: Toxicity incidences were (amifostine, placebo, p value): Grade 2 or higher acute xerostomia (39%, 34%, 0.715), Grade 3 or higher acute mucositis (39%, 22%, 0.055), Grade 2 or higher late xerostomia (37%, 24%, 0.235), and Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (42%, 20%, 0.008). One-year rates of locoregional failure, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not significantly different between treatments.CONCLUSIONS: The used amifostine doses were not able to reduce the toxicity of simultaneous radiochemotherapy for head-and-neck cancer. The safety of amifostine and the lack of tumor protection were consistent with previous studies.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amifostine', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Carboplatin', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Radiation-Protective Agents', 'Stomatitis', 'Survival Rate', 'Xerostomia']",16243440,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D02.705.400.625.050', 'D02.705.539.345.050', 'D02.886.300.692.050'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['D02.257.125'], ['E02.186'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['C04.588.443'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.082.750', 'E02.319.267.530.540'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C26.733', 'G01.750.748.500', 'N06.850.460.350.850.500', 'N06.850.810.300.360'], ['D27.505.696.706.776', 'D27.720.799.763'], ['C07.465.864'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['C07.465.815.929']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40803,Cooperative cleavage of the R peptide in the Env trimer of Moloney murine leukemia virus facilitates its maturation for fusion competence.,"The spike protein of murine leukemia virus, MLV, is made as a trimer of the Env precursor. This is primed for receptor-induced activation of its membrane fusion function first by cellular furin cleavage in the ectodomain and then by viral protease cleavage in the endodomain. The first cleavage separates the peripheral surface (SU) subunit from the transmembrane (TM) subunit, and the latter releases a 16-residue-long peptide (R) from the TM endodomain. Here, we have studied the distribution of R peptide cleavages in the spike TM subunits of Moloney MLV preparations with partially R-peptide-processed spikes. The spikes were solubilized as trimers and separated with an R peptide antibody. This showed that the spikes were either uncleaved or cleaved in all of its TM subunits. Further studies showed that R peptide cleavage-inhibited Env mutants, L(649)V and L(649)I, were rescued by wild-type (wt) Env in heterotrimeric spikes. These findings suggested that the R peptide cleavages in the spike are facilitated through positive allosteric cooperativity; i.e., the cleavage of the TM subunit in one Env promoted the cleavages of the TMs in the other Envs. The mechanism ensures that protease cleavage in newly released virus will generate R-peptide-cleaved homotrimers rather than heterotrimeric intermediates. However, using a cleavage site Env mutant, L(649)R, which was not rescued by wt Env, it was possible to produce virus with heterotrimers. These were shown to be less fusion active than the R-peptide-cleaved homotrimers. Therefore, the cooperative cleavage will speed up the maturation of released virus for fusion competence.","['Gene Products, env', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Virus Internalization', 'Virus Release']",21228228,"[['D12.776.775.320', 'D12.776.964.775.325', 'D12.776.964.970.880.325'], ['B04.613.807.375.525.596', 'B04.820.650.375.525.596'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600', 'G02.111.691.600', 'G03.734.871.790.600', 'G05.308.670.600'], ['G06.920.881'], ['G06.920.913']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3945,Age differences in hostility among middle-aged and older adults.,"Multiple measures of hostility were administered to middle-aged and older volunteers. There was a positive association between age and self-report measures reflecting hostile beliefs about others, including cynicism and suspiciousness. There was a weak inverse relationship between age and self-report measures of the overt expression of anger and aggression, but no association between age and measures of covert hostility was found. There was a positive relationship between age and an assessment of hostile behavior that was based on the respondent's interaction style during an interview. The magnitude of these age trends did not differ between men (n = 50) and women (n = 75). These findings illustrate the multidimensional nature of hostility. They also have practical implications for older people because hostility is associated with psychological well-being and has been shown to have consequences for health and longevity.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aging', 'Anger', 'Female', 'Gender Identity', 'Hostility', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Irritable Mood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Personality Assessment']",8461112,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G07.345.124'], ['F01.470.093'], ['F01.393.446.250', 'F01.752.747.385.200', 'F01.752.747.722.200', 'F02.739.794.793.200'], ['F01.470.596'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.401'], ['F01.470.047.110'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.513']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
9433,Refining the predictive pursuit endophenotype in schizophrenia.,"BACKGROUND: To utilize fully a schizophrenia endophenotype in gene search and subsequent neurobiological studies, it is critical that the precise underlying physiologic deficit is identified. Abnormality in smooth pursuit eye movements is one of the endophenotypes of schizophrenia. The precise nature of the abnormality is unknown. Previous work has shown a reduced predictive pursuit response to a briefly masked (i.e., invisible) moving object in schizophrenia. However, the overt awareness of target removal can confound the measurement.METHODS: This study employed a novel method that covertly stabilized the moving target image onto the fovea. The foveal stabilization was implemented after the target on a monitor had oscillated at least for one cycle and near the change of direction when the eye velocity momentarily reached zero. Thus, the subsequent pursuit eye movements were completely predictive and internally driven. Eye velocity during this foveally stabilized smooth pursuit was compared among schizophrenia patients (n = 45), their unaffected first-degree relatives (n = 42), and healthy comparison subjects (n = 22).RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives performed similarly and both had substantially reduced predictive pursuit acceleration and velocity under the foveally stabilized condition.CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that inability to maintain internal representation of the target motion or integration of such information into a predictive response may be the specific brain deficit indexed by the smooth pursuit endophenotype in schizophrenia. Similar performance between patients and unaffected relatives suggests that the refined predictive pursuit measure may index a less complex genetic origin of the eye-tracking deficits in schizophrenia families.","['Adult', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale', 'Female', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motion Perception', 'Perceptual Masking', 'Phenotype', 'Pursuit, Smooth', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder']",17662963,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F02.830.104.214'], ['F02.463.188.150'], ['F04.711.513.653.083'], ['E01.370.225.562', 'E05.200.562', 'E05.393.435', 'N02.421.308.430', 'N02.421.726.233.221'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F02.463.593.932.567'], ['F02.463.593.071.594', 'F02.463.593.932.733', 'G07.888.125.594'], ['G05.695'], ['G14.350.453'], ['F03.700.750'], ['F04.824'], ['F03.675.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
46068,Effect of fosinopril treatment on serum C-reactive protein levels in patients with microalbuminuria.,"Inflammation is an important factor in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Observational studies have suggested that renin-angiotensin system inhibition might lower C-reactive protein (CRP). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with fosinopril would reduce inflammation in a placebo-controlled trial involving 621 subjects. CRP was determined using a high-sensitivity assay at baseline and after 3 months of fosinopril treatment. The median CRP level at baseline was 1.38 mg/dl (interquartile range 0.64 to 2.86) and did not significantly differ between treatment groups. CRP levels at baseline were significantly associated with future cardiovascular events, even after adjustment for age and gender (odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 2.67, p = 0.008). Fosinopril treatment during 3 months did not result in a significantly higher reduction of CRP levels compared with placebo (difference -0.11, p = 0.20). Exploratory analysis suggested an interaction between gender and fosinopril treatment on CRP reduction (p = 0.07). Male gender was associated with a significantly larger reduction in CRP compared to female gender. In conclusion, contrary to previous observational studies, no effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on CRP levels was found.","['Albuminuria', 'Angiotensin II', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'C-Reactive Protein', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Fosinopril', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Renin-Angiotensin System', 'Sex Factors']",18602526,"[['C12.777.934.734.269', 'C13.351.968.934.734.269', 'C23.888.942.750.269'], ['D06.472.699.094.078', 'D12.644.400.070.078', 'D12.644.456.073.041', 'D12.644.548.058.078', 'D12.776.631.650.070.078', 'D23.469.050.050.050'], ['D27.505.519.389.745.085'], ['D12.776.034.145', 'D12.776.124.050.120', 'D12.776.124.486.157'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['D02.705.629.500', 'D12.125.072.401.623.374'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.470'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['G03.820', 'G09.330.380.813'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

39975,PET predicts prognosis after 1 cycle of chemotherapy in aggressive lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease.,"UNLABELLED: Early identification of chemotherapy-refractory lymphoma patients provides a basis for alternative treatment strategies. Metabolic imaging with (18)F-FDG PET offers functional tissue characterization that is useful for assessing response to therapy. Our objective was to determine the predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET early during chemotherapy (after 1 cycle) and at the completion of chemotherapy for subsequent progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin's disease (HD).METHODS: (18)F-FDG PET (dual-head coincidence camera with attenuation correction) was performed before and after 1 cycle of chemotherapy on 30 patients (17 NHL, 13 HD; mean age, 52.3 +/- 16.0 y). For 23 of the 30 patients, (18)F-FDG PET data were also obtained after the completion of chemotherapy. The patients had a median follow-up of 19 mo (range, 18-24 mo). Follow-up of PFS was compared between patients with positive and negative (18)F-FDG PET results obtained after the first cycle of chemotherapy and at the completion of chemotherapy.RESULTS: Positive (18)F-FDG PET results obtained both after the first cycle and at the completion of therapy were associated with a shorter PFS (median, 5 and 0 mo, respectively) than were negative (18)F-FDG PET results (PFS medians not reached). A statistically significant difference in PFS between positive and negative (18)F-FDG PET results was obtained both after the first cycle and at the completion of chemotherapy (P < or = 0.001). The PFS and (18)F-FDG PET results obtained after the first cycle correlated better than those obtained after the completion of chemotherapy (r(2) = 0.45 vs. 0.17). (18)F-FDG PET had more false-negative results after the last cycle (6/17 cases, or 35%) than after the first cycle (2/13 cases, or 15%). Thus, (18)F-FDG PET had greater sensitivity and positive predictive values after the first cycle (82% vs. 45.5% and 90% vs. 83%, respectively) than after the last cycle.CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET after 1 cycle of chemotherapy is predictive of 18-mo outcome in patients with aggressive NHL and HD and may earlier identify patients who would benefit from more intensive treatment programs.","['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",12163626,"[['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D09.254.229.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C04.557.386.355', 'C15.604.515.569.355', 'C20.683.515.761.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.386.480', 'C15.604.515.569.480', 'C20.683.515.761.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E01.789'], ['D27.505.259.843', 'D27.505.519.871', 'D27.720.470.410.650'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.370.350.350.800', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800', 'E01.370.350.710.800', 'E01.370.350.825.800', 'E01.370.384.730.800'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Of these, 352 had a high-chance screening result for trisomy 21, and 291 (82.7%) opted for NIPT. The proportion of women opting for NIPT decreased as the chance of trisomy 21 increased: uptake was 93.2%, 90.0%, 77.1% and 47.2% for women with a chance of 1:100-150, 1:50-99, 1:10-49 and >1:10, respectively. 516 women (5.5%) accessed primary NIPT screening in the private sector, and 638 women (6.8%) declined any aneuploidy screening or testing.CONCLUSION: Implementation of NIPT testing in a contingency model has a high uptake in a non-research National Health Service setting; the rate of uptake is related to the combined test risk result.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aneuploidy', 'Choice Behavior', 'Down Syndrome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Noninvasive Prenatal Testing', 'Pregnancy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trisomy 13 Syndrome', 'Trisomy 18 Syndrome', 'United Kingdom', 'Young Adult']",31243005,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['C23.550.210.050', 'G05.365.590.175.050', 'G05.700.131'], ['F02.463.785.373.346'], ['C10.597.606.360.220', 'C16.131.077.327', 'C16.131.260.260', 'C16.320.180.260'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.396.500', 'E01.370.225.562.375', 'E01.370.225.998.054.396.500', 'E01.370.378.630.724', 'E05.200.500.384.100.396.500', 'E05.200.998.054.396.500', 'E05.242.384.100.396.500', 'E05.393.435.375', 'N02.421.308.430.250', 'N02.421.726.233.221.375'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C10.597.606.360.835', 'C14.240.400.970', 'C14.280.400.970', 'C16.131.077.919', 'C16.131.240.400.965', 'C16.131.260.923', 'C16.320.180.923'], ['C14.240.400.975', 'C14.280.400.975', 'C16.131.077.929', 'C16.131.240.400.968', 'C16.131.260.932', 'C16.320.180.932'], ['Z01.542.363'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
19802,Characteristics of Marek's disease viruses isolated from vaccinated commercial chicken flocks: association of viral pathotype with lymphoma frequency.,"Fifty-three Marek's disease (MD) virus (MDV) isolates were obtained from turkey-herpesvirus-vaccinated broiler or layer flocks with excessive MD losses, from control field flocks without excessive MD losses, and from laboratory collections. Twelve isolates were typed as very virulent (vvMDVs) on the basis of excessive pathogenicity for vaccinated chickens, 31 were typed as virulent (vMDVs), and 10 were typed as nonpathogenic (npMDVs). The npMDVs could be distinguished from turkey herpesviruses by cultural and serologic criteria. Compared with standard vMDVs, the vvMDVs appeared clearly more pathogenic; they caused greater depression in body and bursal weights and induced more deaths through the early mortality syndrome, more lymphomas, and more visceral and fewer neural lymphomas in susceptible and resistant chickens. However, no antigenic differences between vvMDVs and vMDVs were detected. The vvMDVs were obtained from both broiler and layer flocks in five widely separated states but may only recently have become prevalent, since none were represented among 10 MDV isolates obtained before 1975. The frequency of isolation of vvMDVs from flocks with excessive MD losses (9/27) was threefold higher than that from control flocks (1/10), suggesting an association of this viral pathotype with vaccine breaks. The npMDVs were also widely distributed but were isolated only from control flocks, thus suggesting that npMDVs may augment turkey-herpesvirus-induced vaccinal immunity.","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 2, Gallid', 'Lymphoma', 'Male', 'Marek Disease', 'Vaccination', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication']",6303287,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['B04.280.382.100.562.400'], ['C04.557.386', 'C15.604.515.569', 'C20.683.515.761'], ['C01.925.256.466.650', 'C01.925.928.489', 'C15.604.515.700', 'C20.683.515.840', 'C22.131.546'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.530.890', 'E05.478.550.600.890', 'N02.421.726.758.310.890', 'N06.850.780.200.425.900', 'N06.850.780.680.310.890'], ['G06.930'], ['G06.920.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1158,Therapeutic effect and risk factors for complications of excision in 76 patients with schwannoma.,"BACKGROUND: Benign schwannoma is the most common tumor of peripheral nerves. However, the clinical course of excision and risk factors associated with postoperative neurological deficits are not well known. We evaluated the incidence of preoperative symptoms, the incidence of postoperative neurological deficits, and the risk factors of neurological deficits.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of 76 patients with schwannomas treated at our institution. We reviewed the clinical characteristics, and postoperative results, and determined the possible risk factors influencing the development of complications.RESULTS: Excision of schwannoma improved the Tinel-like signs in 47 of 51 patients and spontaneous pain in 14 of 15. Eleven of 17 patients with sensory deficits showed complete recovery, but six continued to show deficits with or without improvement. Motor deficits that were observed in four patients persisted in one. New neurological deficits developed in 21 patients and persisted until final follow-up in 8. Tinel-like signs was the risk factor of surgery-related neurological deficits (p = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: New deficits developed predominantly in patients with preoperative Tinel-like signs. Attention should be given to patients with the factor.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurilemmoma', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",24105254,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.595', 'C04.557.580.600.610.595', 'C04.557.580.625.650.595'], ['E04.525'], ['C04.588.614.596', 'C10.551.775', 'C10.668.829.725'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
37616,Properties of protein kinase C associated with nuclear membranes.,"To study signal transduction directed towards the cell nucleus and at the nuclear membranes, we investigated the association of protein kinase C (PKC) with nuclear membranes obtained from nuclei isolated from bovine brain. By use of phorbol-ester-binding assays, significant amounts of PKC could be demonstrated in nuclei and nuclear membranes. Nuclear membranes are shown to be able to activate purified PKC. The PKC endogenously present in nuclear membranes appears to be a so-called 'membrane-inserted' form: it is permanently active, still binds phorbol ester, but its activity is no longer dependent on Ca2+ and cannot be activated by phorbol ester. On the other hand, this form of PKC can be inhibited by specific PKC inhibitors. By using histone HIIIS and a specific peptide substrate, it could be shown that after extraction with Triton X-100 the PKC can be stimulated by phospholipid again. Immunoblot analysis with isoenzyme-specific antibodies revealed that the alpha- and gamma-isoenzymes, but not the beta-isoenzyme, are associated with membranes derived from brain nuclei.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cattle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Detergents', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Isoenzymes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Octoxynol', 'Phorbol Esters', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Signal Transduction', 'Streptolysins']",1530569,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.097'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A11.284.430.106', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.117'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['E05.196.181.400.383'], ['D27.720.877.265', 'J01.516.381'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['A11.284.149.450', 'A11.284.835.514'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D02.033.455.250.700.660', 'D05.750.741.610', 'D25.720.741.610', 'J01.637.051.720.741.610'], ['D02.455.849.291.500.510'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D02.033.455.250.700', 'D05.750.741', 'D25.720.741', 'J01.637.051.720.741'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.776.543.695.937', 'D23.946.123.868', 'D23.946.350.750']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
12486,Subarachnoid Hemorrhage as Result of Retrocorporeal Artery Aneurysm Rupture: Rare Sequel of Subclavian Steal Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Subclavian steal phenomenon can cause retrograde flow in the vertebral artery as a result of ipsilateral occlusion of the subclavian artery. This phenomenon has various clinical presentations, such as claudication of the affected extremity or intermittent vertebrobasilar ischemia. Aneurysm formation in the spinal cord circulation is exceptionally rare but may occur secondary to collateral formation in subclavian steal syndrome.CASE DESCRIPTION: The case presented herein is a 53-year-old male who presented with headache and severe neck pain. Imaging studies revealed that the patient had subarachnoid hemorrhage in the perimedullary and cervicomedullary cisterns and extending to C3-C7 ventrally. Computed tomography angiography reconstruction demonstrated an aneurysmally dilated vessel dorsal to the C6 vertebral body within the spinal canal. Catheter-based angiography of the right subclavian artery demonstrated retrograde flow within the left vertebral artery and confirmed proximal left subclavian artery occlusion, findings diagnostic of subclavian steal. Further, a branch of the right thyrocervical trunk supplied a retrocorporeal artery collateral to the left vertebral artery, which also contributed to the anterior spinal artery.CONCLUSIONS: After endovascular coiling of the aneurysm, the patient had no neurologic deficits or postoperative complications. Postoperative angiography revealed complete obliteration with no residual aneurysm. Imaging further demonstrated patency of the radiculomedullary (anterior spinal) artery.","['Aneurysm, Ruptured', 'Computed Tomography Angiography', 'Endovascular Procedures', 'Headache', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neck Pain', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Subclavian Steal Syndrome', 'Treatment Outcome']",31574332,"[['C14.907.055.185'], ['E01.370.350.350.810.335', 'E01.370.350.567.250', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810.335', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810.335', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810.568', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810.499'], ['E04.100.814.529', 'E04.502.382'], ['C23.888.592.612.441'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.888.592.612.553'], ['C10.228.140.300.535.800', 'C14.907.253.573.800', 'C23.550.414.913.850'], ['C10.228.140.300.150.956.700', 'C14.907.253.092.956.700'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
36103,Load cycling enhances bioactivity at the resin-dentin interface.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate if mechanical loading promotes bioactivity at the resin interface after bonding with three different adhesive approaches.METHODS: Dentin surfaces were subjected to three different treatments: demineralisation by (1) 37% phosphoric acid (PA) followed by application of an etch-and-rinse dentin adhesive Single Bond (SB) (PA+SB), (2) by 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) followed by SB (EDTA+SB), (3) application of a self-etch dentin adhesive: Clearfil SE Bond (SEB). Bonded interfaces were stored in simulated body fluid during 24 h or 3w. One half of each tooth was submitted to mechanical loading. Remineralisation of the bonded interfaces was assessed by AFM imaging/nano-indentation, Raman spectroscopy/cluster analysis, dye assisted confocal microscopy evaluation (CLSM) and Masson's trichrome staining.RESULTS: Loading cycling for 3w promoted an increase of mechanical properties at the resin-dentin interface. Cluster analysis demonstrated an augmentation of the mineral-matrix ratio in SB-loaded specimens. CLSM showed an absent micropermeability and nanoleakage after loading EDTA+SB and SEB specimens. Trichrome staining reflected a narrow demineralised dentin matrix after loading, almost not observable in EDTA+SB and SEB.SIGNIFICANCE: In vitro mechanical loading promoted mineralization in the resin-dentin interfaces, at 24 h and 3w of storage.","['Acid Etching, Dental', 'Adult', 'Dentin', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Materials Testing', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Resin Cements', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman', 'Young Adult']",24630703,"[['E06.931.475.111'], ['M01.060.116'], ['A14.549.167.900.280'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['E05.570'], ['E01.370.350.515.666.400', 'E05.595.666.400'], ['E01.370.350.515.395', 'E05.595.395'], ['D05.750.716.822.730', 'D25.339.291.750', 'D25.720.716.822.730', 'J01.637.051.339.291.750', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.730'], ['E05.196.822.860', 'E05.196.867.890'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

The effects of initial pH, contact time, initial Pb(II) concentration, bacterial concentration, rotation speed and temperature of biosorption of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions were investigated. The optimal condition for Pb2+ ions adsorption was observed at pH 6, with the rotational speed of 120 rpm.min-1, bacterial concentration of 3 g.L-1, temperature of 40 °C and contact time of 12 h. The correlation regression coefficients showed that the biosorption process can be well fitted with the Redlich-Peterson, Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. The equilibrium adsorption capacity reached 53.632 mg.g-1. Binding energy value was 0.264 kJ/mol, which indicated that the adsorption process seemed to involve chemisorption and physisorption. Kinetics of adsorption was found to fit well with the pseudo-second-order and Elovich kinetic equations. Thermodynamic parameters revealed the feasibility, spontaneity and endothermic nature of adsorption.","['Adsorption', 'Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Lactobacillales', 'Lead', 'Solutions', 'Thermodynamics', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",30975929,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['N06.230.080.600.500', 'N06.850.460.375.500'], ['G02.300'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['B03.353.750', 'B03.510.550'], ['D01.268.556.435', 'D01.552.544.435'], ['D26.776'], ['G01.906'], ['D27.888.284.903.655']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
49686,Unique CD4(+) T cells in TCR alpha chain-deficient class I MHC-restricted TCR transgenic mice: role in a superantigen-mediated disease process.,"Mice carrying a transgenic TCR with targeted disruption of the TCR alpha chain (H-Y alpha(-/-)) possess CD4(+) T cells which express the transgenic TCR beta without the alpha chain. These mice developed the murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) after infection with LP-BM5 retroviruses, a process which requires CD4(+) T cells. These cells are negative for TCR delta chain and pre-TCR alpha chain expression, and thus express a unique surface receptor with the TCR beta chain as a component. The cells respond to MAIDS virus-associated superantigen and concanavalin A, but not to protein antigens such as ovalbumin. Thus, this novel surface receptor appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of MAIDS.","['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Genes, RAG-1', 'Hybridomas', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'Retroviridae']",10464179,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.220', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.220', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.220'], ['G04.152'], ['A11.251'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.400'], ['A11.251.353.485', 'A11.251.600.485'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595.500', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595.500', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595.500', 'E05.200.625.107.595.500', 'E05.242.195.107.595.500', 'G04.140.107.595.500', 'G09.188.105.595.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['C01.925.782.815.650', 'C01.925.928.650', 'C22.795.650'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.816.824'], ['B04.613.807', 'B04.820.650']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24091,Overweight and obesity among Alaskan Eskimos of the Bering Straits Region: the Alaska Siberia project.,"OBJECTIVE: To document the height, weight, BMI and prevalence of obesity for Eskimo residents of four villages of the Bering Straits Region of Alaska.DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: 454 Non-pregnant residents over 24 y of age, with at least one Eskimo grandparent participated in one cross sectional survey within each village.MEASUREMENTS: Height, weight, calculation of BMI (kg/m2), proportion of 'overweight' (BMI 25-29.9), and proportion of 'obese' (BMI>/=30).RESULTS: For women and men, respectively, mean heights were 153.4 and 165.2 cm; weights were 64.2 and 71.6 kg; and BMI were 27.2 and 26.2 kg/m2 after age standardization. For women, 27.9% were overweight, and 32.8% were obese compared with 36.2% and 15.6%, respectively, for men. Alaskan Eskimo participants of the Alaska Siberia Project had a significantly lower proportion of total overweight (BMI>/=25, 54.9% for women, and 32.0% for men) compared with the three sites of the Strong Heart Study, which ranged from 65.9 to 80.2% for women and 53.6 to 66.7% for men. Compared with American men of all races, the proportion of overweight and obese participants was similar for Eskimo men. The proportion of obese was significantly higher for Eskimo women compared with American women of all races, but the proportion of overweight was similar.CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of obesity among the Alaskan Eskimos is lower than for American Indians, the high proportion of overweight observed in this study is of concern for Alaskan Eskimo adults, especially for women.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alaska', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Body Height', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inuits', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Obesity', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Factors']",10951530,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['Z01.107.567.875.580.100'], ['M01.686.508.200'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160.100', 'E05.041.124.160.500', 'G07.100.100.160.100', 'G07.345.249.314.100'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.686.508.150.600.375.500', 'M01.686.508.150.675', 'M01.686.754.254.500.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.980.485', 'N05.715.360.300.800.469', 'N06.850.505.616', 'N06.850.520.308.980.469'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
44093,Effect of wheel-running during abstinence on subsequent nicotine-seeking in rats.,"RATIONALE: Exercise appears to be a promising non-pharmacological treatment for nicotine addiction that may be useful for the vulnerable adolescent population.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine if wheel-running, an animal model of aerobic exercise, during an abstinence period would decrease subsequent nicotine-seeking in rats that had extended access to nicotine self-administration during adolescence.METHODS: Male adolescent rats (n = 55) were trained to self-administer saline or nicotine infusions (5 or 10 ìg/kg) under a fixed ratio 1 schedule with a maximum of 20 infusions/day beginning on postnatal day 30. After 5 days, access was extended to 23 h/day with unlimited infusions for a total of 10 days. After the last self-administration session, rats were moved to polycarbonate cages for a 10-day abstinence period where they either had access to a locked or unlocked running wheel for 2 h/day. Nicotine-seeking was examined following the 10th day of abstinence under a within-session extinction/cue-induced reinstatement paradigm.RESULTS: Intake was higher at the 10 ìg/kg dose as compared to the 5 ìg/kg dose; however, intake did not differ within doses prior to wheel assignment. Compared to saline controls, rats that self-administered nicotine at either dose showed a significant increase in drug-seeking during extinction, and consistent with our hypothesis, exercise during abstinence attenuated this effect. Nicotine led to modest but significant levels of cue-induced reinstatement; however, in this adolescent-onset model, levels were variable and not affected by exercise.CONCLUSIONS: Exercise may effectively reduce relapse vulnerability for adolescent-onset nicotine addiction.","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Conditioning, Operant', 'Cues', 'Drug-Seeking Behavior', 'Extinction, Psychological', 'Male', 'Nicotine', 'Physical Conditioning, Animal', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reinforcement Schedule', 'Self Administration', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome']",23371488,"[['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050'], ['F01.145.113'], ['F02.463.425.179.509'], ['F02.463.425.234'], ['F01.145.342'], ['F02.463.425.770.232'], ['D03.132.760.570', 'D03.383.725.518'], ['G11.427.410.698.277.280'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['F02.463.425.770.644'], ['E02.319.890', 'E02.900.890'], ['C25.775.835', 'F03.900.825']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
31284,Viral load in asymptomatic patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts above 500 x 10(6)/l.,"BACKGROUND: HIV-1-infected patients with a CD4+ lymphocyte count > or = 500 x 10(6)/l may be selected for antiretroviral treatment when viral load is above a given cut-off point.OBJECTIVES: To assess the stability of viral load measurement at CD4+ T-cell counts above 500 x 10(6)/l, and the proportion of patients selected for treatment if a cut-off point of 10,000 or 30,000 RNA copies/ml is used.DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventy-eight consecutive asymptomatic antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts > or = 500 x 10(6)/l, presenting for previously scheduled medical visits as outpatients, were enrolled. None of the patients had suffered from symptomatic primary infection or seroconverted within 6 months before enrollment. Two blood samples separated by a 1-month interval [day -30 (screening) and day 0 (enrollment)] were collected in an EDTA tube. Plasma was separated and frozen at -70 degrees C within 4 h of collection. HIV-1 RNA was quantified by polymerase chain reaction. CD4+ T cells were measured by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Viral load was fairly stable, and only four (13%) out of 30 pairs had a variation > or = 0.5 log10. At day -30 and day 0, log10 HIV RNA levels (mean +/- SD) were 4.24 +/- 0.7 and 4.35 +/- 0.87 log10 copies/ml plasma (P = 0.23). The difference of the mean was -0.11 (95% confidence interval, -0.28 to 0.07). At day 0 (n = 78) mean +/- SD value was 35730 +/- 73700 RNA copies/ml (range, < 200-438480; median, 9331; 25th and 75th percentiles, 1518 and 37193, respectively). In 13 patients (16%) the viral load was < 2000 copies RNA/ml. Seven out of 10 patients, who fulfilled the criteria of long-term non-progressors (LTNP), had viral load > 10,000 RNA copies/ml, and two patients had > 30,000 RNA copies/ml. Only two of the 13 patients with CD4+ T-cell counts > 750 x 10(6)/l had viral load > 10,000 copies/ml.CONCLUSIONS: A single-point viral load assessment is enough in asymptomatic patients with CD4+ lymphocytes counts > or = 500 x 10(6)/l since plasma HIV RNA measurements obtained 1 month apart are fairly stable. Approximately 25% of these patients (including some patients with LTNP criteria) will be selected for treatment if 30,000 RNA copies/ml is used as cut-off point, and approximately 50% if the cut-off point is 10,000 RNA copies/ml.

43325,[Factors Contributing Successful Ultrasound-guided Radial Artery Cannulation and Its Complications When Using the Short-axis Out-of-plane Procedure].,"Objective To identify the possible factors that may influence the success and the complications of ultrasound-guided out-of-plane radial arterial cannulation. Methods Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the clinical data of 131 patients undergoing elective surgery and ultrasound-guided out-of-plane radial artery cannulation,dynamic needle tip positioning(DNTP) technique or angular distance(AD) technique and to find out the factors associated with the one-attempt success rate,overall success rate,posterior arterial wall perforation,and local hematoma. Results The depth of the anterior arterial wall?3 mm was the factor associated with posterior arterial wall perforation(OR=0.314,95%CI:0.143-0.691,P=0.004) and local hematoma(OR=0.250,95%CI:0.107-0.585,P=0.001).The use of DNTP method was significantly associated with posterior arterial wall perforation(OR=0.303,95%CI:0.138-0.667,P=0.003). Conclusions During ultrasound-guided out-of-plane radial cannulation,puncture at the arterial anterior wall sites with a depth of?3 mm can reduce the incidence of posterior arterial wall perforation and local hematoma.Compared with AD,DNTP can lower the incidence of posterior arterial wall perforation.","['Catheterization, Peripheral', 'Elective Surgical Procedures', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Radial Artery', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional']",32131945,"[['E02.148.224', 'E04.100.814.529.937', 'E04.502.382.937', 'E05.157.375'], ['E04.249'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['A07.015.114.740'], ['E01.370.350.850.855', 'E04.502.890']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

8088,Case study approach to modeling historical disinfection by-product exposure in Iowa drinking waters.,"In the 1980s, a case-control epidemiologic study was conducted in Iowa (USA) to analyze the association between exposure to disinfection by-products (DBPs) and bladder cancer risk. Trihalomethanes (THMs), the most commonly measured and dominant class of DBPs in drinking water, served as a primary metric and surrogate for the full DBP mixture. Average THM exposure was calculated, based on rough estimates of past levels in Iowa. To reduce misclassification, a follow-up study was undertaken to improve estimates of past THM levels and to re-evaluate their association with cancer risk. In addition, the risk associated with haloacetic acids, another class of DBPs, was examined. In the original analysis, surface water treatment plants were assigned one of two possible THM levels depending on the point of chlorination. The re-assessment considered each utility treating surface or groundwater on a case-by-case basis. Multiple treatment/disinfection scenarios and water quality parameters were considered with actual DBP measurements to develop estimates of past levels. The highest annual average THM level in the re-analysis was 156ìg/L compared to 74ìg/L for the original analysis. This allowed the analysis of subjects exposed at higher levels (>96ìg/L). The re-analysis established a new approach, based on case studies and an understanding of the water quality and operational parameters that impact DBP formation, for determining historical exposure.","['Disinfection', 'Drinking Water', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Iowa', 'Models, Chemical', 'Neoplasms', 'Risk Assessment', 'Trihalomethanes', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Water Purification', 'Water Supply']",28774607,"[['N06.850.780.200.450.850.375'], ['D01.045.250.875.300', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650.300', 'D01.650.550.925.199', 'G07.203.100.418', 'J02.200.418'], ['N06.850.460.350'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.107.567.875.510.370'], ['E05.599.495'], ['C04'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['D02.455.526.913'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.900.900', 'N06.850.860.510.900.900'], ['J01.293.821.500']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
36242,Prevalence of mycoplasmal and ureaplasmal recovery from tracheobronchial lavages and prevalence of mycoplasmal recovery from pharyngeal swab specimens in dogs with or without pulmonary disease.,"The prevalence of mycoplasmal and ureaplasmal recovery from tracheobronchial lavage specimens and the prevalence of mycoplasmal recovery from pharyngeal swab specimens from dogs with (n = 38) or without (n = 26) pulmonary disease were determined. Similar mycoplasmal recovery rates were found for tracheobronchial lavage specimens from dogs > or = 1 year old with (21%) or without (25%) pulmonary disease. Prevalence of mycoplasmal recovery from tracheobronchial lavages was significantly associated with pulmonary disease among dogs < 1 year old (P = 0.04), and with dogs that had concurrent Bordetella (P = 0.006) and Streptococcus (P = 0.05) isolations. Among dogs with pulmonary disease, mycoplasmas were significantly (P = 0.02) more prevalent in dogs with septic inflammation than in dogs with nonseptic inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree. Ureaplasmas were only isolated from a tracheobronchial lavage specimen of 1 dog with pulmonary disease and from none of the dogs without pulmonary disease. Most dogs with (84%) and all dogs without pulmonary disease had mycoplasmas isolated from the pharynx. Seemingly, mycoplasmas are part of the normal pharyngeal flora of most dogs and normal inhabitants of the lower airway in about a fifth to a fourth of the canine population > or = 1 year old. Dogs < 1 year old with pulmonary disease and dogs with concurrent Bordetella or tracheobronchial streptococcal isolations may be more susceptible to mycoplasmal colonization of the lower airways. Seemingly, ureaplasmas are rarely associated with pulmonary disease, and are not normal inhabitants of the trachea and bronchi of dogs.","['Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Lung Diseases', 'Male', 'Mycoplasma', 'Pharynx', 'Ureaplasma']",8498740,"[['B01.050'], ['B03'], ['C01.150.252'], ['E05.927.100.500'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['C08.381'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.553'], ['A03.556.750', 'A04.623', 'A14.724'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4001,Neopterin plasma levels in burn patients.,"Burn victims have severely depressed cellular immunity and despite careful hygiene, antibiotics and early surgical therapy the infection rate remains high. The assessment of plasma neopterin levels can be considered as an indirect measurement of macrophage function, because activation of macrophages is accompanied by the release of D-erythro-neopterin. The influence of burn trauma on neopterin levels was investigated to determine whether neopterin estimations might have a prognostic or diagnostic value. Twenty patients with a mean age of 36 +/- 16 years and a TBSA of 45.5 per cent +/- 23 were studied. During the whole hospital treatment daily blood samples were analysed for neopterin levels using radioimmunoassay. Starting from normal levels (9 +/- 1.6 nmol/l), neopterin content increased continuously until day 10 (30-40 nmol/l), then fluctuated around these high levels for several weeks. There were no differences between patients with TBSA less than 35 per cent or greater than 35 per cent, and between survivors and non-survivors. Burn injury caused a constant increase of plasma neopterin indicating an intact reaction by macrophages. It can be used as an additional parameter for the diagnosis of sepsis: high values being a sign of adequate reaction by macrophages, whereas low neopterin values in the presence of bacteraemia and clinical symptoms of sepsis show a deleterious impairment of immune functions.","['Adult', 'Bacteremia', 'Biopterin', 'Burns', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neopterin', 'Prognosis']",1642764,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C01.150.252.100', 'C01.757.100', 'C23.550.470.790.500.100'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.202', 'D08.211.090'], ['C26.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G12.450.050.400'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.202.500', 'D08.211.090.500'], ['E01.789']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

After initiating anaesthesia, they were asked to position the patient and estimate the angle of tilt, which was then measured.RESULTS: Almost every anaesthetist positioned the patient less than 15 degrees because they overestimated the angle of tilt. When questioned on their knowledge of the current advice for lateral tilt, 11 of the 16 anaesthetists were aware of the 15 degrees recommendation.CONCLUSION: Estimation of the angle of table tilt is unreliable.","['Anesthesia, Obstetrical', 'Cesarean Section', 'Clinical Competence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Pregnancy', 'Surgical Equipment']",12488385,"[['E03.155.364'], ['E04.520.252.500'], ['I02.399.630.210', 'N04.761.210', 'N05.715.175'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.760.731.400', 'E04.604.249', 'N02.421.585.722.400'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E07.858']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Relatively little is known regarding the effects of these agents on the kidney. Clinically, there have been a handful of reports associating imatinib with acute renal failure. Preclinical reports indicate that imatinib inhibits signaling pathways which may play a role in renal injury. We report the case of a patient with imatinib-resistant CML who developed renal failure after being placed on dasatinib. When she later became resistant to dasatinib she was switched to nilotinib. Shortly thereafter, she became dialysis-independent.

17866,Synchronous airway lesions and outcomes in infants with severe laryngomalacia requiring supraglottoplasty.,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the prevalence and the impact of synchronous airway lesions identified by endoscopy in infants undergoing supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia (LM).DESIGN: Retrospective study.SETTING: Tertiary care pediatric hospital.PATIENTS: Sixty patients who underwent supraglottoplasty for severe LM from 2002 to 2006. Patients who underwent preoperative tracheotomy, had previous airway surgery, or did not have 6 months of follow-up were excluded. Fifty-two patients met inclusion criteria.INTERVENTION: Supraglottoplasty (with carbon dioxide laser).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of synchronous airway lesions and their contribution to upper airway obstruction (UAO) and their effect on the postoperative course after supraglottoplasty.RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent of patients had synchronous airway lesions (SALs), of whom 77% had subglottic stenosis (SGS) and 47% had tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia, or both. Sixty-three percent of all patients required postoperative nonsurgical airway support. Eight patients had residual UAO requiring additional surgical intervention, with 3 revision supraglottoplasties and 7 tracheotomies performed. Infants with neurological conditions had a high rate of surgical intervention (55%; P = .001). Patients with SGS exceeding 35% but without any neurological condition had a prolonged hospital stay (>3.6 days; P = .02) and an 83% incidence (P = .04) of postoperative UAO requiring intubation. Infants with LM with laryngeal edema (LE) alone had increased frequency of postoperative nonsurgical airway support (P = .02) and a prolonged hospital stay of 1 day (P = .01) compared with infants without edema.CONCLUSIONS: There is a high incidence of SALs in patients undergoing supraglottoplasty. Neurological conditions, hypoplastic mandible, SGS greater than 35%, and preexisting LE independently adversely affected the postoperative course.","['Bronchomalacia', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Comorbidity', 'Glottis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Laryngeal Edema', 'Laryngomalacia', 'Laryngoscopy', 'Laryngostenosis', 'Laser Therapy', 'Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tracheobronchomalacia', 'Tracheomalacia']",19620584,"[['C05.182.895.249', 'C08.127.719.500', 'C16.131.621.953.249', 'C17.300.182.895.249'], ['E01.370.386.105', 'E01.370.388.250.100', 'E04.502.250.100', 'E04.928.600.080'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['A04.329.364'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['C08.360.313', 'C09.400.313'], ['C05.182.310', 'C08.360.563', 'C09.400.563', 'C16.131.621.568', 'C17.300.182.310'], ['E01.370.386.460', 'E01.370.388.250.525', 'E04.502.250.525', 'E04.580.373'], ['C08.360.591', 'C09.400.591', 'C16.131.740.658'], ['E02.594', 'E04.014.520'], ['E04.580'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C05.182.895', 'C08.127.719', 'C08.907.796', 'C16.131.621.953', 'C17.300.182.895'], ['C05.182.895.500', 'C08.907.796.500', 'C16.131.621.953.500', 'C17.300.182.895.500']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
29369,Efficient neuroplasticity induction in chronic stroke patients by an associative brain-computer interface.,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to improve functionality in chronic stoke patients when applied over a large number of sessions. Here we evaluated the effect and the underlying mechanisms of three BCI training sessions in a double-blind sham-controlled design. The applied BCI is based on Hebbian principles of associativity that hypothesize that neural assemblies activated in a correlated manner will strengthen synaptic connections. Twenty-two chronic stroke patients were divided into two training groups. Movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) were detected by electroencephalography during repetitions of foot dorsiflexion. Detection triggered a single electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve timed so that the resulting afferent volley arrived at the peak negative phase of the MRCP (BCIassociative group) or randomly (BCInonassociative group). Fugl-Meyer motor assessment (FM), 10-m walking speed, foot and hand tapping frequency, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, and the excitability of the corticospinal tract to the target muscle [tibialis anterior (TA)] were quantified. The TA motor evoked potential (MEP) increased significantly after the BCIassociative intervention, but not for the BCInonassociative group. FM scores (0.8 ± 0.46 point difference, P = 0.01), foot (but not finger) tapping frequency, and 10-m walking speed improved significantly for the BCIassociative group, indicating clinically relevant improvements. Corticospinal tract integrity on DTI did not correlate with clinical or physiological changes. For the BCI as applied here, the precise coupling between the brain command and the afferent signal was imperative for the behavioral, clinical, and neurophysiological changes reported. This association may become the driving principle for the design of BCI rehabilitation in the future.

29669,Single nucleotide polymorphisms 5' upstream the coding region of the NEIL2 gene influence gene transcription levels and alter levels of genetic damage.,"NEIL2 (EC 4.2.99.18), a mammalian DNA glycosylase and ortholog of the bacterial Fpg/Nei, excises oxidized DNA lesions from bubble or single-stranded structures, suggesting its involvement in transcription-coupled DNA repair. Because base excision repair (BER) proteins act collectively and in a progressive fashion, their proper balance is essential for optimal repair. Thus, inter-individual variability in transcription levels of NEIL2 may predispose to compromised DNA repair capacity and genomic instability by altering the balance of critical BER proteins. In a study of lymphocytes of 129 healthy subjects, using absolute quantitative reverse transcription PCR, we found that NEIL2 transcription varied significantly (up to 63 fold) and that this variability was influenced by certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located 5' of the start site. Using the mutagen sensitivity assay to characterize the biological significance of these SNPs, we observed a significant increase in mutagen-induced genetic damage associated with two SNPs in the promoter region of the NEIL2 gene. To characterize the functional significance of these SNPs, we engineered luciferase-reporter constructs of the NEIL2 promotor with mutations corresponding to these SNPs. We transfected these constructs into MRC-5 cells and evaluated their impact on NEIL2 expression levels. Our results indicate that NEIL2 expression was significantly reduced by over 50% (P < 0.01) in the presence of two SNPs, ss74800505 and rs8191518, located near the NEIL2 start site, which were in significant linkage disequilibrium (D' = 73%; P < 0.05). This first report on in vivo variability in NEIL2 expression in humans identifies SNPs in the NEIL2 promoter region that have functional effects.","[""5' Flanking Region"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Glycosylases', 'DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase', 'Ethnic Groups', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sex Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",18651651,"[['G05.360.340.024.220.282', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.295'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.200'], ['D08.811.074.249', 'D08.811.277.450.430.099'], ['D08.811.074.750', 'D08.811.520.241.225'], ['M01.686.754', 'N01.224.317'], ['G05.380.350'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
33728,Malpractice Environment vs Direct Litigation: What Drives Nursing Home Exit?,"An ongoing concern about medical malpractice litigation is that it may induce provider exit, potentially affecting consumer welfare. The nursing home sector is subject to substantial litigation activity but remains generally understudied in terms of the effects of litigation, due perhaps to a paucity of readily available data. In this article, we estimate the association between litigation and nursing home exit (closure or change in ownership), separating the impact of malpractice environment from direct litigation. We use 2 main data sources for this study: Westlaw's Adverse Filings database (1997-2005) and Online Survey, Certification and Reporting data sets (1997-2005). We use probit models with state and year fixed effects to examine the relationship between litigation and the probability of nursing home closure or change in ownership with and without adjustment for malpractice environment. We examine the relationship on average and also stratify by profit status, chain membership, and market competition. We find that direct litigation against a nursing home has a nonsignificant effect on the probability of closure or change in ownership within the subsequent 2 years. In contrast, the broader malpractice environment has a significant effect on change in ownership, even for nursing homes that have not been sued, but not on closure. Effects are stronger among for-profit and chain facilities and those in more competitive markets. A high-risk malpractice environment is associated with change of ownership of nursing homes regardless of whether they have been directly sued, indicating that it is too blunt an instrument for weeding out low-quality nursing homes.","['Economic Competition', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Malpractice', 'Nursing Homes', 'Ownership', 'Personnel Staffing and Scheduling', 'Quality of Health Care', 'United States']",30111267,"[['N03.219.188'], ['M01.526.485', 'N02.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.880.604.583.524', 'N03.706.535.606'], ['N02.278.825.610'], ['I01.880.604.583.594', 'N04.452.633'], ['I03.946.225', 'N04.452.677.650'], ['N04.761', 'N05.715'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
599,Sexual differentiation of mammalian frontal cortex.,"The pattern of distribution of the progesterone binding sites was examined in selected nuclei of the brain of male and female rat. In female rats the frontal cortex resulted to be the region with the highest concentration of 3H R5020 binding sites. However, in male rats the same region showed very little progestin binding activity. When female rats were androgenized via neonatal exposure to testosterone, the progestin binding activity of the frontal cortex became similar to that we observed in male rats. The present investigation indicates that sexual differentiation of the rat brain may include also brain regions not clearly involved in sex related functions like the frontal cortex.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Castration', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Male', 'Promegestone', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Progesterone', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tritium']",3561146,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E04.270.282', 'E04.950.165'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['D04.210.500.668.651.443.680'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D12.776.826.750.765'], ['G08.686.815'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949'], ['D01.268.406.875', 'D01.362.340.875', 'D01.496.749.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

19955,Streptococcus thermophilus in cheddar cheese--production and fate of galactose.,"The behaviour of Streptococcus thermophilus in combination with Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris or subsp. lactis mesophilic starters in experimental Cheddar cheese is reported. In a standard manufacturing procedure employing a 38 degrees C cook temperature, even very low levels (0.007%) of Str. thermophilus combined with normal levels of the mesophilic starter (1.7%) resulted in increased rates of acid production, the formation of significant amounts of galactose (approximately 13 mmol/kg cheese), and populations nearly equivalent to those of the mesophilic lactic starter in the curd before salting. At a 41 degrees C cook temperature, the Str. thermophilus attained a higher maximum population (approximately log 8.2 colony forming units (cfu)/g) than the Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris (approximately log 6.8 cfu/g) and formed more galactose (approximately 28 mmol/kg). Lactobacillus rhamnosus, deliberately added to a cheese made using Str. thermophilus starter and which contained 24 mmol galactose/kg at day one, utilized all the galactose during the first 3 months of cheese ripening. Adventitious non-starter lactic acid bacteria had the potential to utilize this substrate too, and a close relationship was demonstrated between the increase in this flora and the disapearance of the galactose. Some possible consequences for cheese quality of using Str. thermophilus as a starter component are discussed.","['Cheese', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Fermentation', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'Galactose', 'Lactococcus lactis', 'Streptococcus', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",11504394,"[['G07.203.200.500.444', 'G07.203.300.350.300.444', 'J02.350.500.444', 'J02.500.350.300.444'], ['E01.370.225.875.220', 'E05.200.875.220'], ['G02.111.158.249', 'G03.191.249'], ['J01.576.423.200'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.332', 'J01.576.423.850.730.500.249.300', 'N06.850.425.200', 'N06.850.460.400.300', 'N06.850.601.500.249.300'], ['D09.947.875.359.377'], ['B03.353.750.737.500.400', 'B03.510.400.800.500.400', 'B03.510.550.737.500.400'], ['B03.353.750.737.872', 'B03.510.400.800.872', 'B03.510.550.737.872'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0

It is possible that cholecalciferol, due to its lipid-soluble nature, had a lipophilic interaction with the cell membrane, enhancing antibiotic uptake. Cholesterol and ergosterol were used to see if the mechanism of action of cholecalciferol was similar to that of these lipid compounds. Ergosterol and cholesterol increased aminoglycoside activity, where the effect was greater with higher subinhibitory concentration of sterol.CONCLUSIONS: There is no reported study on the use of cholesterol and ergosterol as modulators of antibiotics or any other drug, making this the first study in this area highlighting the interaction between cholesterol, ergosterol, and cholecalciferol with regard to modifying aminoglycoside activity.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Cholecalciferol', 'Cholesterol', 'Ergosterol', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests']",31124408,"[['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.159', 'D04.210.500.247.808.146', 'D04.210.500.812.768.196', 'D10.570.938.146'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197', 'D10.570.938.208'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.537'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

These tasks rely on a computer. Here we demonstrate that the computational integration can be performed directly with the human eye. This builds upon the known persistence time of the human eye and we use our ghost imaging approach as an alternative to evaluate the temporal response of the eye. We verify that the image persistence time is of order 20 ms, followed by a further 20 ms exponential decay. These persistence times are consistent with previous studies but can now potentially be extended to include a more precise characterisation of visual stimuli and provide a new experimental tool for the study of visual perception.","['Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Pattern Recognition, Visual', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Sensory Thresholds', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Vision Tests']",31052733,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E05.599'], ['F02.463.593.524.500', 'F02.463.593.932.622'], ['E07.671'], ['F02.463.593.710'], ['L01.224.800'], ['E01.370.380.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The clusters are ferri-, ferro- or non-magnetic, depending on cluster size and geometry. We determine the atomic Co moments and their relative alignment, and show that antiferromagnetic spin alignment in the Co clusters is caused by hybridization with the tungsten substrate and band filling.

32554,SCL interacts with VEGF to suppress apoptosis at the onset of hematopoiesis.,"During development, hematopoiesis initiates in the yolk sac through a process that depends on VEGF/Flk1 signaling and on the function of the SCL/Tal1 transcription factor. Here we show that VEGF modifies the developmental potential of primitive erythroid progenitors and prolongs their life span. Furthermore, the survival of yolk sac erythrocytes in vivo depends on the dose of VEGF. Interestingly, in Vegf(lo/lo) embryos carrying a hypomorph allele, Flk1-positive cells reach the yolk sac at E8.5, but are severely compromised in their ability to generate primitive erythroid precursors. These observations indicate that during embryonic development, different thresholds of VEGF are required for the migration and clonal expansion of hematopoietic precursors. The near absence of primitive erythroid precursors in Vegf(lo/lo) embryos correlates with low levels of Scl in the yolk sac. Strikingly, gain-of-function of SCL partially complements the hematopoietic defect caused by the hypomorph Vegf(lo) allele, and re-establishes the survival of erythroid cells and the expression of erythroid genes (Gata1 and betaH1). This indicates that SCL functions downstream of VEGF to ensure an expansion of the hematopoietic compartment.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Movement', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Erythrocytes', 'Erythroid Cells', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A']",14729577,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D12.776.260.103', 'D12.776.930.125'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['D12.776.260'], ['A11.118.290', 'A11.443.240', 'A15.145.229.334'], ['A11.443'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.350'], ['G04.152.825', 'G09.188.343'], ['A11.148.378', 'A11.872.378', 'A15.378.316.378'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.776.624.664.700'], ['D12.776.260.103.829', 'D12.776.624.664.700.960', 'D12.776.930.125.829'], ['D12.776.930'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Retinal oxygenation levels were determined using a non-invasive measurement of haemoglobin oxygen saturation by digital photographic fundus oximetry.RESULTS: Both brinzolamide and dorzolamide reduced the number of zero-flow pixels in the retina as measured by HRF, suggesting an increase in retinal blood flow (-6.86 and -0.452 respectively) with brinzolamide treatment resulting in fewer zero-flow pixels than dorzolamide (-6.41) (p = 0.024). Both brinzolamide and dorzolamide increased oxygen saturation in the retina as measured by photographic retinal oximetry in the superior (0.82 (p = 0.002) and 0.87 (p = 0.005)) and inferior (0.88 (p = 0.035) and 0.82 (p = 0.002)) retinal veins. No significant changes were found in CDI measurements of the retrobulbar blood supply during either treatment.CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that brinzolamide and dorzolamide may increase retinal oxygen saturation in patients with OAG.","['Aged', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Blood Pressure', 'Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Glaucoma, Open-Angle', 'Humans', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Laser-Doppler Flowmetry', 'Male', 'Microcirculation', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen', 'Pilot Projects', 'Retinal Vessels', 'Sulfonamides', 'Thiazines', 'Thiophenes', 'Visual Acuity']",18369067,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.411.162'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['D27.505.519.389.200'], ['E01.370.380.850.950.500', 'F02.463.593.778.435.110', 'F02.463.593.932.281', 'F02.463.593.932.901.500', 'G14.940.500'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['C11.525.381.407'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G14.440'], ['E01.370.370.475', 'E05.830.500'], ['G09.330.100.645'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['A07.015.611'], ['D02.065.884', 'D02.886.590.700'], ['D02.886.665', 'D03.383.855'], ['D02.886.778', 'D03.383.903'], ['E01.370.380.850.950', 'F02.463.593.932.901', 'G14.940']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
4366,Defining a pulmonary exacerbation in cystic fibrosis.,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the central importance of pulmonary exacerbations (PExs) as an outcome measure in cystic fibrosis clinical trials, no standardized definition of PEx exists. We conducted a prospective, multicenter study to establish a standardized PEx definition and score for use in clinical trials, based on clinical status rather than on treatment decisions.STUDY DESIGN: Subjects were 246 patients enrolled in the placebo arm of a randomized, controlled trial of tobramycin for inhalation. Physician-investigators completed PEx questionnaires on all subjects at scheduled intervals during the 6-month study, indicating new or worsening symptoms, physical examination findings, and impression of PEx status (presence or absence and severity). Logistic regression was used to assess the relative importance of each of the characteristics in predicting a PEx.RESULTS: We developed 2 PEx scores that use easily ascertained symptoms and chest examination findings; one also includes change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second over the preceding month. Both scores were sensitive and specific for predicting the presence of a PEx (sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 86%). The scores were validated in subjects in the intervention arm of the trial.CONCLUSION: We hope that the proposed PEx score might serve as a standardized outcome measure for future clinical trials in cystic fibrosis, allowing meaningful comparisons of study results.","['Administration, Inhalation', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases', 'Male', 'Maximal Expiratory Flow Rate', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tobramycin']",11562614,"[['E02.319.267.050'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['C06.689.202', 'C08.381.187', 'C16.320.190', 'C16.614.213'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C08.381'], ['E01.370.386.700.660.225.500', 'G09.772.650.300.590'], ['E05.318.372.658', 'N05.715.360.330.643', 'N06.850.520.450.643'], ['E05.318.370.800.750', 'E05.318.740.872.750', 'N05.715.360.325.700.680', 'N06.850.520.445.800.750'], ['E05.318.372.250.250.365.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250.365.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250.365.500'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['D09.408.051.476.600.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
28551,Fuzzy Stochastic Petri Nets for Modeling Biological Systems with Uncertain Kinetic Parameters.,"Stochastic Petri nets (SPNs) have been widely used to model randomness which is an inherent feature of biological systems. However, for many biological systems, some kinetic parameters may be uncertain due to incomplete, vague or missing kinetic data (often called fuzzy uncertainty), or naturally vary, e.g., between different individuals, experimental conditions, etc. (often called variability), which has prevented a wider application of SPNs that require accurate parameters. Considering the strength of fuzzy sets to deal with uncertain information, we apply a specific type of stochastic Petri nets, fuzzy stochastic Petri nets (FSPNs), to model and analyze biological systems with uncertain kinetic parameters. FSPNs combine SPNs and fuzzy sets, thereby taking into account both randomness and fuzziness of biological systems. For a biological system, SPNs model the randomness, while fuzzy sets model kinetic parameters with fuzzy uncertainty or variability by associating each parameter with a fuzzy number instead of a crisp real value. We introduce a simulation-based analysis method for FSPNs to explore the uncertainties of outputs resulting from the uncertainties associated with input parameters, which works equally well for bounded and unbounded models. We illustrate our approach using a yeast polarization model having an infinite state space, which shows the appropriateness of FSPNs in combination with simulation-based analysis for modeling and analyzing biological systems with uncertain information.","['Fuzzy Logic', 'Models, Biological', 'Stochastic Processes']",26910830,"[['E05.599.250', 'K01.752.448.250', 'L01.224.050.375.250'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E05.318.740.996', 'G17.830', 'N05.715.360.750.770', 'N06.850.520.830.996']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
7685,Comparative performance assessment of point-of-care testing devices for measuring glucose and ketones at the patient bedside.,"Point-of-care (POC) testing devices for monitoring glucose and ketones can play a key role in the management of dysglycemia in hospitalized diabetes patients. The accuracy of glucose devices can be influenced by biochemical changes that commonly occur in critically ill hospital patients and by the medication prescribed. Little is known about the influence of these factors on ketone POC measurements. The aim of this study was to assess the analytical performance of POC hospital whole-blood glucose and ketone meters and the extent of glucose interference factors on the design and accuracy of ketone results. StatStrip glucose/ketone, Optium FreeStyle glucose/ketone, and Accu-Chek Performa glucose were also assessed and results compared to a central laboratory reference method. The analytical evaluation was performed according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) protocols for precision, linearity, method comparison, and interference. The interferences assessed included acetoacetate, acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, galactose, maltose, uric acid, and sodium. The accuracies of both Optium ketone and glucose measurements were significantly influenced by varying levels of hematocrit and ascorbic acid. StatStrip ketone and glucose measurements were unaffected by the interferences tested with exception of ascorbic acid, which reduced the higher level ketone value. The accuracy of Accu-Chek glucose measurements was affected by hematocrit, by ascorbic acid, and significantly by galactose. The method correlation assessment indicated differences between the meters in compliance to ISO 15197 and CLSI 12-A3 performance criteria. Combined POC glucose/ketone methods are now available. The use of these devices in a hospital setting requires careful consideration with regard to the selection of instruments not sensitive to hematocrit variation and presence of interfering substances.","['Blood Glucose', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ketones', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Point-of-Care Systems']",25519295,"[['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.522'], ['E01.370.520'], ['N04.452.442.452.452.680', 'N04.452.515.360.652', 'N04.590.874']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
22086,Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using multimers of the 16th non-collagenous domain of the BP180 antigen for sensitive and specific detection of pemphigoid autoantibodies.,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) and pemphigoid gestationis (PG) are acquired autoimmune subepidermal blistering diseases characterized by autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal proteins BP180/type XVII collagen and BP230. In the vast majority of BP and PG patients, these autoantibodies bind to epitopes clustered within the 16th non-collagenous domain of BP180. An ELISA system for the detection of these autoantibodies was developed and evaluated using 16th non-collagenous domain (NC16A) tetramers instead of monomers. In contrast to antigens fused to large proteins used in the past for the detection of autoantibodies against type XVII collagen, tetrameric antigen fragments bearing a small hexahistidine tag allow for high expression levels without the need to cleave off the fusion partner. Using tetrameric BP180 NC16A, positive reactions were found in 106 (89.8%) of 118 randomly selected BP sera and in all of 20 (100%) randomly selected PG sera, whereas only 2.2% of a large cohort of control subjects were positive in this assay, including patients with rheumatoid arthritis (two of 107), progressive systemic sclerosis (two of 50), systemic lupus erythematosus (one of 72), and healthy blood donors (10 of 494). Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the new anti-tetrameric NC16A ELISA were 89.9% and 97.8% respectively. Levels of circulating autoantibodies against BP180 paralleled disease activity in the pemphigoid patients. In conclusion, the use of tetrameric NC16A in ELISA results in a sensitive and specific tool for diagnosis and monitoring of BP and PG.","['Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Non-Fibrillar Collagens', 'Pemphigoid Gestationis', 'Pemphigoid, Bullous', 'Peptides', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",17697150,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.323', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.323', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.323'], ['D23.050.422'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.860.300.250.400'], ['C13.703.570', 'C17.800.865.700'], ['C17.800.865.690', 'C20.111.730'], ['D12.644'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.776.828'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1768,Risk factors for peptic ulcer disease in renal transplant patients--11 years of experience from a single center.,"BACKGROUND: Peptic ulcer disease is a common complication among renal transplant recipients and causes significant morbidity and mortality.METHODS: From 1990 through 2000, 465 renal transplant patients were followed-up in our institute. Most patients received corticosteroids and cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimen. About one third (n = 156) of them received mycophenolate mofetil. Patients with endoscopy-proved peptic ulcer disease were identified by reviewing medical records. Possible risk factors were analyzed by univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Among 465 kidney transplant patients, there were 181 (38.9%) who suffered at least 1 episode of peptic ulcer disease. The most frequent types of peptic ulcer disease were gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, duodenitis and esophageal ulcer. By multivariate analysis, the use of methylprednisolone pulse therapy (odds ratio = 3.954, 95% confidence interval = 3.154-18.312, p = 0.03) and history of pre-transplant peptic ulcer disease (odds ratio = 7.599, 95% CI = 1.211-12.905, p < 0.0001) were independent risk factors for posttransplant peptic ulcer disease.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that renal transplant patients who undergo methylprednisolone pulse therapy for acute rejection or who have a history of pre-transplant peptic ulcer disease carry a high risk for the development of peptic ulcer disease and deserve intensive antiulcer treatment.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Ulcer Agents', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptic Ulcer', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",15267008,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D27.505.954.483.203'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.696.477.656'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['E02.870.500', 'E04.936.450.485', 'E04.950.774.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C06.405.469.275.800', 'C06.405.748.586'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
38668,Structure and temporal dynamics of the bacterial communities associated to microhabitats of the coral Oculina patagonica.,"Corals are known to contain a diverse microbiota that plays a paramount role in the physiology and health of holobiont. However, few studies have addressed the variability of bacterial communities within the coral host. In this study, bacterial community composition from the mucus, tissue and skeleton of the scleractinian coral Oculina patagonica were investigated seasonally at two locations in the Western Mediterranean Sea, to further understand how environmental conditions and the coral microbiome structure are related. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with next-generation sequencing and electron microscopy to characterize the bacterial community. The bacterial communities were significantly different among coral compartments, and coral tissue displayed the greatest changes related to environmental conditions and coral health status. Species belonging to the Rhodobacteraceae and Vibrionaceae families form part of O. patagonica tissues core microbiome and may play significant roles in the nitrogen cycle. Furthermore, sequences related to the coral pathogens, Vibrio mediterranei and Vibrio coralliilyticus, were detected not only in bleached corals but also in healthy ones, even during cold months. This fact opens a new view onto unveiling the role of pathogens in the development of coral diseases in the future.","['Animals', 'Anthozoa', 'Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis', 'Ecosystem', 'Mediterranean Sea', 'Vibrio']",27690185,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.308.237'], ['E05.196.401.402.117', 'E05.301.300.319.201'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['Z01.756.592'], ['B03.440.450.900.859', 'B03.660.250.830.830']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
17050,Solubilization in mixed micelles studied by molecular dynamics simulations and COSMOmic.,"Up to now, micelles composed of different surfactants (mixed micelles) are rarely studied with molecular methods. This is in contrast to their importance for pharmaceutical or industrial applications, where it is of great interest to predict the partition behavior for a large set of solutes (screening) within mixed micelles. This work is focused on molecular simulations of phase equilibria in mixed surfactant systems, because mixtures of different types of surfactants (nonionic or ionic) in aqueous solution can change the partition behavior of solutes tremendously. The extension of COSMO-RS for anisotropic phases, named COSMOmic, is computationally efficient and can be used as a screening tool for finding adequate surfactant systems for a specific extraction task. However, it needs micellar structures as an input. Therefore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the self-assembly of pure Brij35 (polyethylene glycol dodecyl ether) and mixtures either with CTAB (cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide) or SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) at different concentrations are performed. The micelles from the self-assembly MD simulations are used to predict the partition behavior of various solutes between micelle and bulk water with COSMOmic. In this way, various micelles of different size and composition are investigated and structural influences on partition equilibria of solute molecules like ephedrine, acetone, toluene, coumarin, isovanillin, ferulic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, and phenol are analyzed. For the first time, the self-assembly of pure Brij35 and the mixtures of Brij35/CTAB and Brij35/SDS is studied on an atomistic scale. Significant influences of atomic structure and composition of mixed micelles on partition equilibria are elucidated. The findings of this detailed analysis are in good agreement with experimental data and likely to improve the knowledge and understanding of mixed micellar extraction processes and can pave the way for more practical applications in the future.","['Cetrimonium', 'Cetrimonium Compounds', 'Micelles', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate', 'Surface-Active Agents', 'Water']",24533791,"[['D02.092.877.883.111.500', 'D02.675.276.190.500'], ['D02.092.877.883.111', 'D02.675.276.190'], ['D05.374', 'D26.255.560'], ['E05.599.595.500', 'G02.111.570.895', 'L01.224.160.500'], ['D02.033.455.250.700', 'D05.750.741', 'D25.720.741', 'J01.637.051.720.741'], ['D02.033.415.220.720', 'D02.886.645.600.055.050.632', 'D10.289.220.720'], ['D27.720.877'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
28546,Tissue-Engineered Skin Substitute Enhances Wound Healing after Radiation Therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: When given in conjunction with surgery for treating cancer, radiation therapy may result in impaired wound healing, which, in turn, could cause skin ulcers. In this study, bilayer and monolayer autologous skin substitutes were used to treat an irradiated wound.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single dose of 30 Gy of linear electron beam radiation was applied to the hind limb of nude mice before creating the skin lesion (area of 78.6 mm). Monolayer tissue-engineered skin substitutes (MTESSs) were prepared by entrapping cultured keratinocytes in fibrin matrix, and bilayer tissue-engineered skin substitutes (BTESSs) were prepared by entrapping keratinocytes and fibroblasts in separate layers. Bilayer tissue-engineered skin substitute and MTESS were implanted to the wound area. Gross appearance and wound area were analyzed to evaluate wound healing efficiency. Skin regeneration and morphological appearance were observed via histological and electron microscopy. Protein expressions of transforming growth factor â1 (TGF-â1), platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in skin regeneration were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).RESULTS: Macroscopic observation revealed that at day 13, treatments with BTESS completely healed the irradiated wound, whereas wound sizes of 1.1 ± 0.05 and 6.8 ± 0.14 mm were measured in the MTESS-treated and untreated control groups, respectively. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) analysis showed formation of compact and organized epidermal and dermal layers in the BTESS-treated group, as compared with MTESS-treated and untreated control groups. Ultrastructural analysis indicates maturation of skin in BTESS-treated wound evidenced by formation of intermediate filament bundles in the dermal layer and low intercellular space in the epidermal layer. Expressions of TGF-â1, PDGF-BB, and VEGF were also higher in BTESS-treated wounds, compared with MTESS-treated wounds.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that BTESS is the preferred treatment for irradiated wound ulcers.","['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Mice', 'Radiotherapy', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Skin, Artificial', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Wound Healing']",26866868,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.223', 'E05.200.500.265', 'E05.242.223', 'E05.481.500.249'], ['E02.095.147.500', 'E04.936.225'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E02.815'], ['E02.095.147.725.700', 'E04.680.275.850', 'E04.936.580.700'], ['E07.858.082.800'], ['E05.481.500.311.500', 'J01.293.069.249.500'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
29389,Facilitated recovery from postischemic suppression of protein synthesis in the gerbil brain with ischemic tolerance.,"Preconditioning of the gerbil brain with a 2-min period of sublethal ischemia followed by 4 days of reperfusion protects against neuronal damage following a subsequent 3-min period of ischemia, which normally destroys pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. To clarify the role of protein synthesis in this ischemic tolerance phenomenon, we performed an autoradiographic analysis with [14C]leucine at 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after 3 min of ischemia with and without preconditioning. General protein synthesis in the CA1 region was severely suppressed after 4 h in both groups. The protein synthesis in CA1 partially recovered after 24 h and fully recovered after 48 h in animals with preconditioning, but never recovered in animals without preconditioning. Protein synthesis in the neocortex and the striatum was suppressed in the early reperfusion periods only in animals without preconditioning. The results show that the ischemic tolerance is closely related to the facilitated recovery from suppressed protein synthesis in the brain after ischemia.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Brain', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Gerbillinae', 'Hippocampus', 'Leucine', 'Male', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Reperfusion', 'Time Factors']",7895099,"[['G07.025', 'G16.012.500'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.750.132', 'E05.200.750.132', 'E05.799.256'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C10.228.140.300.150', 'C14.907.253.092'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.300'], ['A08.186.211.180.405', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.345'], ['D12.125.070.637', 'D12.125.142.441'], ['D12.776.631'], ['E04.100.700', 'E05.680.730'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9857,Polypeptide pattern of human breast epithelial cells following human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment.,"Numerous attempts have made to describe the particular protein pattern of malignant cells by using high resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). The placental hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) inhibits tumor initiation and progression in experimental animals and has an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human breast epithelial cells (HBEC) in vitro. The inhibitory effect on the immortalized HBEC MCF-10F is accompanied by the immunocytochemical expression of inhibin alpha and beta subunits by treated cells. With the purpose of clarifying the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect, the pattern of protein synthesis and mRNA were studied by 2-D PAGE in the immortalized HBEC MCF-10F cells treated in vitro 1001U for 24 h. The effect of hCG treatment on the synthesis of MCF-10F cells was monitored by labeling both control and treated cells with [S35]methionine and separation by 2-D PAGE. At least 11 proteins were preferentially synthesized and five specific polypeptides were decreased in hCG treated cells in comparison with controls. The hCG induced at least four new mRNAs which encoded protein in the molecular mass range of 24-72 kDa. It also increased the expression of at least six mRNAs and reduced the expression of least four mRNAs in comparison with control cells. The hCG-treated cells actively synthesized a 33-kDa polypeptide which was not present in control cells. The nature of this hCG-inducible 33 kDa protein elucidated by immunoprecipating [S35]methionine-labeled proteins with antisera directed against rat inhibin subunit alpha and beta b.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Breast', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Peptides', 'Prostatic Secretory Proteins', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger']",7925253,"[['A01.236'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G04.346'], ['D06.472.699.322.326', 'D06.472.699.649.367', 'D12.644.548.726.367', 'D12.776.780.400'], ['E05.196.401.250', 'E05.301.300.230'], ['A11.436'], ['A10.272'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['D12.644'], ['D12.776.866.249'], ['G02.111.660.871', 'G03.734.871', 'G05.297.670'], ['D13.444.735.544']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
38166,Cell damage associated with changing the medium of mesencephalic cultures in serum-free medium is mediated via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.,"Dopaminergic neurons from embryonic rat mesencephalon were grown in simple serum-free media. The cells develop over a period of several weeks in vitro, particularly between day 14 and day 23. Removing the culture medium and replacing it with fresh medium during this interval caused severe damage to the cultures; this damage is mediated by excitatory amino acids acting through glutamate receptors. Damage could be completely prevented by antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor. As expected, medium that contains glutamate (i.e., Ham's F-12 medium) caused damage; however, medium that contains no glutamate or aspartate (i.e., Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium) also caused severe damage, and most of the damage was dependent on the presence of glutamine in the medium. The presence of the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin greatly enhanced damage caused by medium change.","['2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate', '6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione', 'Animals', 'Buffers', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Dizocilpine Maleate', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Mesencephalon', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Quinoxalines', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate']",1672142,"[['D12.125.070.950.100', 'D12.125.740.025'], ['D03.633.100.857.160'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.720.470.280'], ['A11.251'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.181.384.380', 'D04.615.181.384.380'], ['D12.125.067.625', 'D12.125.119.409'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['A08.186.211.132.659'], ['D12.125.067.500.400', 'D12.125.119.170.400'], ['D03.633.100.857'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6836,[Visionary choice of Japanese radiologists and radiological technologists in 21st century].,"Since X-ray CT appeared in radiology practice in the 1970s, there has been rapid progress in imaging modalities such as US, MRI, PET, and PACS. With these new modalities, radiology has strengthened its advantage in medical practice. In earlier times, it was said ""ohne Roentgen, keine Medizin"". This is still true today, and undoubtedly will be true even in the future. Medical practice can no longer be carried out in the absence of the new imaging technologies. On the other hand, sophisticated computer technology has engendered a new fight for turf among the medical specialties. To win this battle, I consider improved mutual understanding, close cooperation, and esprit de corps between radiologists and radiological technologists to be of utmost importance. This article describes the following: (1) what a medical team should be, (2) how a good medical team should be organized, (3) how important a four-year course in medical technology is, (4) how our survival can be ensured in the new turf battle with advanced medical technology, (5) how JMCP should be run in the future, (6) how important it is for Japanese radiology to show a strong presence in the Asian-Oceanian Society of Radiology, (7) how we can survive in a digital world, and (8) how we should relate to the recent social environment surrounding us.","['Humans', 'Radiology', 'Technology, Radiologic', 'Workforce']",11857952,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H02.403.740'], ['E05.920', 'H02.010.850', 'J01.897.891'], ['N04.452.525']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0
16360,Multi-ethnic genetic association study of carotid intima-media thickness using a targeted cardiovascular SNP microarray.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identification of subclinical atherosclerosis by ultrasonographic measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is a validated tool, in conjunction with traditional risk factors, for clinical assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. IMT has also been recognized as a quantitative measure of cardiovascular disease progression in asymptomatic individuals, and many candidate gene association studies have attempted to identify genetic variants associated with interindividual differences in IMT with limited success. We sought to test the association between subclinical atherosclerosis measured by IMT and approximately 50,000 SNPs, densely mapping approximately 2100 genes found on the gene-centric Illumina cardiovascular disease beadchip in a multi-ethnic population-based sample.METHODS: IMT was measured by B-mode ultrasound and DNA was collected from a population-based sample of South Asian (n=328), Chinese (n=302), and European Caucasian (n=268) participants. Genetic association was measured using multivariate linear regression including adjustment for covariates.RESULTS: The most robust association across all models tested was observed for a SNP (rs3791398) in histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4; P=1.8e-5 to P=3.6e-5), while another strong association signal was observed with natriuretic peptide receptor a/guanylate cyclase A (NPR1) (rs10082235, P=5.4e-5). Seven of 13 previously reported functional candidate genes contained a SNP that was marginally associated (0.01 < P < or = 0.05).CONCLUSION: This initial multi-ethnic high-density association study of carotid IMT suggests some novel loci requiring further evaluation in follow-up studies.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Continental Population Groups', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Testing', 'Histone Deacetylases', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Receptors, Atrial Natriuretic Factor', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Risk Factors', 'Tunica Intima', 'Ultrasonography']",19679847,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.686.508.200'], ['A07.015.114.186'], ['C10.228.140.300.200.360', 'C14.907.137.230', 'C14.907.253.123.360'], ['M01.686.508'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['E01.370.225.562', 'E05.200.562', 'E05.393.435', 'N02.421.308.430', 'N02.421.726.233.221'], ['D08.811.277.087.520'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.393.661.640', 'E05.393.760.640', 'E05.588.570.660', 'E05.601.640'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['D08.811.520.650.600.500.500', 'D12.776.543.750.700.500', 'D12.776.543.750.750.160'], ['D12.776.260.703', 'D12.776.930.780'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['A07.015.700'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
20211,Mac-2 binding protein and galectin-3 expression in mucinous tumours of the ovary: an annealing control primer system and immunohistochemical study.,"AIM: We used a new differential display method, the annealing control primer (ACP) system, to analyse the differentially expressed genes in mucinous ovarian tumours. To verify the corresponding target gene, immunohistochemical staining was performed on various epithelial tumours of the ovary.METHODS AND RESULTS: The ACP-based reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that 21 genes were upregulated in the mucinous ovarian adenoma and 14 genes were upregulated in the mucinous ovarian carcinoma. Among them, we selected one upregulated gene, the Mac-2 binding protein (Mac-2 BP), and verified the expression of the Mac-2 BP and its ligand, galectin-3, in a variety of epithelial ovarian tumours by immunohistochemistry. Positive expression of the Mac-2 BP was significantly higher in the mucinous ovarian tumours compared to the other epithelial tumours. Mac-2 BP expression was significantly increased in the borderline and malignant tumours compared to the benign tumours. Galectin-3 expression was more frequent in clear cell carcinomas, serous tumours and mucinous tumours than in endometrioid and transitional tumours. However, there were no differences in galectin-3 expression in comparisons among benign, borderline and malignant mucinous and serous tumours.CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the Mac-2 BP may play a role in the development and progression of mucinous ovarian tumours.","['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Mucinous', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Galectin 3', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",19291534,"[['D23.050.285'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.480.225', 'C04.557.470.590.480.225'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['D12.776.503.307.300'], ['G05.297'], ['E05.393.332'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['D12.776.395.550', 'D12.776.543.550'], ['C04.588.322.455', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705', 'C13.351.937.418.685', 'C19.344.410', 'C19.391.630.705'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['E05.588.570.850']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
32587,Sleep and depression in combat-related PTSD inpatients.,"The sleep of 27 unmedicated Vietnam combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) inpatients was monitored for 3 nights. Depressive comorbidity was considered both as a diagnostic category using DMS-III-R criteria, and as a continuous variable using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Data collected included sleep architecture features that have discriminated unipolar depressives from controls in many prior studies, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency, and slow-wave sleep time, as well as two additional indices that have sometimes discriminated depressives from controls in waking studies-baseline heart rate and facial electromyography. Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-III-R (SCID)-diagnosed PTSD+major depressive disorder (MDD) patients failed to exhibit shorter REM latencies, greater REM percents of sleep, or greater REM densities than PTSD-MDD patients, but did exhibit less slow wave sleep. PTSD+MDD patients also exhibited less facial (mentalis) electromyographic activity. REM densities and baseline heart rates were equivocal. REM density, baseline heart rate, and mentalis electromyography all correlated with the BDI, the former two positively, the last, negatively. In summary, SCID-diagnosed PTSD+MDD patients failed to exhibit the classic REM sleep architectural modifications associated with unipolar depression, despite the fact that several other psychophysiologic indices of dysphoria were detectable in their sleep.","['Adult', 'Combat Disorders', 'Comorbidity', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Electromyography', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polysomnography', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Reaction Time', 'Sleep Wake Disorders', 'Sleep, REM', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam']",8837979,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F03.950.750.249'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['F03.600.300'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.520.625'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['E05.796.817', 'F02.830.650', 'F04.669.817', 'G11.561.677'], ['C10.886', 'C23.888.592.796', 'F03.870'], ['F02.830.855.796.671', 'G11.561.803.754.671'], ['M01.930'], ['Z01.252.145.945']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
2277,Workplace violence against resident doctors in a tertiary care hospital in Delhi.,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers particularly doctors are at high risk of being victims of verbal and physical violence perpetrated by patients or their relatives. There is a paucity of studies on work-related violence against doctors in India. We aimed to assess the exposure of workplace violence among doctors, its consequences among those who experienced it and its perceived risk factors.METHODS: This study was done among doctors working in a tertiary care hospital in Delhi. Data were collected by using a self-administered questionnaire containing items for assessment of workplace violence against doctors, its consequences among those who were assaulted, reporting mechanisms and perceived risk factors.RESULTS: Of the 169 respondents, 104 (61.4%) were men. The mean (SD) age of the study group was 28.6 (4.2) years. Sixty-nine doctors (40.8%) reported being exposed to violence at their workplace in the past 12 months. However, there was no gender-wise difference in the exposure to violence (p=0.86). The point of delivery of emergency services was reported as the most common place for experiencing violence. Verbal abuse was the most common form of violence reported (n=52; 75.4%). Anger, frustration and irritability were the most common symptoms experienced by the doctors who were subjected to violence at the workplace. Only 44.2% of doctors reported the event to the authorities. 'Poor communication skills' was considered to be the most common physician factor responsible for workplace violence against doctors.CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of doctors are victims of violence by their patients or relatives.

29224,Hierarchical Bayesian modeling in dichotomous processes in the presence of nonresponse.,"Sampling units that do not answer a survey may dramatically affect the estimation results of interest. The response may even be conditional on the outcome of interest in the survey. If estimates are found using only those who responded, the estimate may be biased, known as nonresponse bias. We are interested in finding estimates of success rates from a survey. We begin by looking at two current Bayesian approaches to treating nonresponse in a hierarchical model. However, these approaches do not consider possible spatial correlations between domains for either success rate or response rate. We build a Bayesian hierarchical spatial model to explicitly estimate the success rate, response rate given success, and response rate given failure. The success rates in the domains of the survey are allowed to be spatially correlated. We also allow spatial dependence between domains in both response rate given success and response rate given failure. Spatial dependence is induced by a common latent spatial structure between the two conditional response rates. We use the 1998 Missouri Turkey Hunting Survey to illustrate this methodology. We find significant spatial correlation in the success rates and incorporating nonrespondents has an impact on the success rate estimates.","['Animals', 'Animals, Wild', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Bias', 'Biometry', 'Data Collection', 'Linear Models', 'Markov Chains', 'Missouri', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Sampling Studies', 'Turkeys']",15032773,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.300'], ['E05.318.740.600.200', 'N05.715.360.750.625.150', 'N06.850.520.830.600.200'], ['N05.715.350.150', 'N06.850.490.500'], ['E05.318.740.225', 'N06.850.505.200'], ['E05.318.308', 'L01.399.250', 'N05.715.360.300', 'N06.850.520.308'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E05.318.740.600.500', 'E05.318.740.996.500', 'G17.830.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.500', 'N05.715.360.750.770.500', 'N06.850.520.830.600.500', 'N06.850.520.830.996.500'], ['Z01.107.567.875.510.515'], ['E05.318.740.525', 'L01.906.394.422', 'N05.715.360.750.540', 'N06.850.520.830.525'], ['E05.318.372.875', 'N05.715.360.330.875', 'N06.850.520.450.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.800', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
45413,Substrate-induced activation of dienelactone hydrolase: an enzyme with a naturally occurring Cys-His-Asp triad.,"The Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad found in dienelactone hydrolase (DLH) is unusual for several reasons. It has not been observed in other hydrolytic enzymes and it is virtually inactive when it is produced by site-directed mutagenesis in the proteases. We propose a model to explain why this triad is catalytically active in DLH but not in the proteases. In the resting state of DLH, His202 forms an ion pair with Asp171 and Cys123 exists as a thiol. The resting state thiol does not interact with His202 in the active site but instead forms a hydrogen bond with Glu36 in the interior of the molecule. In the absence of substrate, Glu36 is also ion paired with Arg206. When substrate binds, Arg206 forms a second ion pair with the anionic substrate and the Arg206/Glu36 ion pair weakens. The destabilized Glu36 carboxylate shifts towards and deprotonates the Cys123 thiol, thereby activating the nucleophile. As the thiolate anion is not energetically favoured in the hydrophobic interior of the enzyme, it swings into the active site where it can be stabilized by the His202 imidazolium and the dipole of helix C. The Cys123 thiolate which now lies adjacent to the acyl carbon of the substrate, is thus generated only in the presence of substrate. The mode of thiolate activation reduces the susceptibility of DLH towards thiol alkylating agents.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Catalysis', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Lactones', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation']",8234228,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D08.811.277.352.100'], ['G02.130'], ['E05.196.309.742.225'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['G02.282'], ['D02.540'], ['E05.599.495'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
759,[Current status of chronic cough treatment in Chinese children].,"OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively understand the current situation of the treatment of chronic cough in Chinese children and provide evidence for a reasonable standard therapy.METHOD: According to the 2008 Guideline of diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough in children that were formulated by The Subspecialty Group of Respiratory Diseases, the Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association and the Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Pediatrics, the questionnaire of the cause of chronic cough in children was designed and 29 hospitals in 19 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions were enrolled. Cases with chronic cough completed 3-month follow-up during May 2009 to April 2010 and information about drug treatment was collected. All data were input through Epidata 3.0 and SPSS19.0 software for statistical analysis.RESULT: Totally 4 529 cases were eligible (the passing rate is 98.8%). The leading three causes were cough variant asthma (CVA), upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) and post-infectious cough (PIC). The drug treatment was given to 3 537 cases (77.2%) at the first visit, and 1 044 cases (22.8%) were not given the treatment but were followed up for observation. In the follow-up period 2 524 cases adhered to medication (55.1%), 2 057 cases (44.9%) failed to adhere to treatment. The leading three medications in CVA patients was leukotriene receptor antagonists (81.68%), antihistamines (50.53%) and beta 2 agonists (37.77%). Follow-up showed that the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was on the rise and by the third month it was listed the second (10.74%). No significant difference (P = 0.092> 0.05) was found among the the effect of drugs used alone but there was significant difference among combinations (P = 0.006). Beta 2 agonists play a special role in the diagnosis and treatment of CVA. In UACS children, 49.80% cases used antimicrobial agents at first visit. Follow-up showed rapid decrease of antimicrobial usage and ICS use increased to the second position. Antihistamines and leukotriene combined with inhaled corticosteroids scheme had the best effect, 61.35% of PIC children were already given antimicrobial drugs before enrollment, compared with CVA (P = 0.000 1) and the utilization rate declined with a clear diagnosis. The effects of beta lactams and macrolides had no significant difference (P = 0.052).CONCLUSION: The choices of treatment for chronic cough in Chinese children are diverse, which is related to overlapping in etiology, diagnosis and the regional drug sources and habits in use of drugs. Currently, leukotriene receptor antagonists are at the first place in children with chronic cough medicine, but its effect was not significantly different from those of beta 2 agonists, antihistamines monotherapy. ICS has not been widely recognized in the treatment of children with chronic cough, even in the CVA. Rational use of antimicrobial agents has been improved. Pediatricians' understanding of chronic cough is being improved. We emphasize the principle of watching, waiting and follow-up in children with chronic cough. Effect on the determination of some CVA patients 1 to 3 months follow-up period is still too inadequate and may be considered appropriate to extend, while cases of multiple etiologies need to extend more observation and waiting time.","['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Asthma', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cough', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Leukotriene Antagonists', 'Treatment Outcome']",24824384,"[['D06.472.040'], ['D27.505.519.625.050.100.200.200', 'D27.505.696.577.050.100.200.200'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['C08.618.248', 'C23.888.852.293'], ['E02.319.283'], ['E02.319.310'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['D27.505.519.625.375.425.400', 'D27.505.696.577.375.425.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C20.543'], ['D06.347.565', 'D27.505.696.399.450.565'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

18963,A 10376 bp deletion of FECH gene responsible for erythropoietic protoporphyria.,"Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP, MIM 177000) is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance since the phenotypic expression requires coinheritance of a null allele and a wild-type low expressed allele of Ferrochelatase gene (FECH). In this study, we identify a peculiar mutation in a young Canadian patient of Italian origin. The patient had clinical and biochemical symptoms of EPP, the wild-type low expressed allele but at preliminary analysis no mutation in the promoter, in the entire coding region and in the splice junctions of the gene. Family studies of seven most common polymorphisms along the gene established absence of Mendelian segregation for the promoter polymorphism only. The intron 1 polymorphism appeared in heterozygosis suggesting an hypothetical deletion in the first region of the gene. In order to identify the size of this deletion, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis was extended to the upstream N-asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase gene (NARS). We analyzed two polymorphisms in the last exon of this gene and a dizigous region was found in the patient. A Long-PCR with primers located in previously fixed heterozygous regions showed a 10,376 bp deletion (c.1-7887_67+2422del) that included a portion of the upstream intergenic region, the promoter, the exon 1 and a portion of intron 1. RNA analysis demonstrated that the lack of the entire promoter prevents the expression of the mutated allele, in fact the expression of the Ferrochelatase gene was decreased by half in the subjects carrying only the mutation compared to control.","['Alleles', 'Child', 'Ferrochelatase', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protoporphyria, Erythropoietic', 'Sequence Deletion']",17888693,"[['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['M01.060.406'], ['D08.811.520.500', 'D12.776.157.427.374.375.957', 'D12.776.556.579.374.375.617', 'D12.776.575.562'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['C06.552.830.812', 'C16.320.850.742.812', 'C17.800.827.742.812', 'C18.452.811.400.812'], ['G05.365.590.762', 'G05.558.800']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
8559,Antibiotic prescribing for children. Too much and too little? Retrospective observational study in primary care.,"AIMS: To investigate the extent of dose-related off-label antibiotic paediatric prescribing in primary care and to identify any potential clinical effects, particularly of lower than recommended dose prescribing.METHODS: Assessment of antibiotic prescribing in 168 396 children aged 0-16 years for the year 1999-2000 from data retrieved from 158 general practices using the national Scottish primary care computer system GPASS. The setting was general practices in Scotland.RESULTS: During the study period at least one course of antibiotics was prescribed to 23 911 children (14.2%). A total of 4582 (19.2%) children were prescribed an antibiotic dose of less than that recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). The number of children prescribed an antibiotic at less than recommended dose increased with age from 1154 (11.8%) aged 0-4 years to 1827 (30.0%) in the 12-16 years age group. For each antibiotic, prescribing lower than recommended dose occurred most frequently at those ages at which a dose increase was recommended in the SPC. Antibiotic prescribing at less than the recommended dose was not associated with an increased return rate for further antibiotic prescriptions during the following month, but in 5-11-year-olds was associated with a significant 48% increase in the total number of antibiotic courses prescribed during the study year [mean = 2.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79, 2.39]vs. 1.41 [95% CI 1.35, 1.47]]. Antibiotic prescribing at doses higher than recommended occurred less frequently (1.6%) and decreased steadily with age.CONCLUSIONS: Off-label prescribing of antibiotics at less than the recommended dose in children is common in primary care and occurs primarily as the result of a failure to increase antibiotic dosage with age in line with SPC recommendations. Adoption of a uniform approach to SPC age banding for antibiotic dose increments would reduce the frequency of dose-related off-label antibiotic prescribing in children and help minimize the potential for the development of antibiotic resistance.","['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Family Practice', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Retrospective Studies', 'Scotland']",12848780,"[['M01.060.057'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E02.319.307', 'N02.421.668.778.500'], ['H02.403.340.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['N04.590.374.577', 'N05.300.625'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['Z01.542.363.766']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
19603,Analysis of miR-96 and miR-133a Expression in Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.,"Grading of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms (GI-NENs) relies mainly on mitotic activity and Ki-67 proliferation index. It is often difficult to predict metastatic potential of these neoplasms. Recent studies have shown that GI-NENs express a wide spectrum of microRNAs. We examined two microRNAs (miR-96 and miR-133a) that were recently identified in GI-NENs to determine if they could assist in evaluating the biological behavior of these neoplasms. A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed with 51 primary GI-NENs, mainly from the small intestine and metastatic tumors from the same cases, including liver metastases (N = 20) and lymph node metastases (N = 33). The cases were immunohistochemically stained for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and Ki-67. In situ hybridization (ISH) was done with probes from Exiqon (Woburn, MA). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was also performed on all the cases (N = 105). ISH analysis showed that miR-96 expression was significantly higher in the liver metastatic neoplasms compared to the primary NENs (p < 0.05); however, it was not significant for miR-133a expression levels. qRT-PCR showed that miR-96 levels were increased during progression from the primary tumors to metastases in the liver. qRT-PCR showed a decrease in miR-133a in the liver metastases compared to the primary tumors (p < 0.05). Appendiceal carcinoids without metastases (n = 3) had low levels of miR-96 and high levels of miR-133a by qPCR. The study suggests that analysis of these two microRNAs by qRT-PCR may be useful in detecting more aggressive GI-NENs and that ISH analysis may also assist in the evaluation of patients with GI-NENs.","['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors']",29032398,"[['D23.101.140'], ['C04.588.274.476', 'C06.301.371', 'C06.405.249'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D13.150.650.319', 'D13.444.735.150.319', 'D13.444.735.790.552.500'], ['E01.789.612'], ['C04.557.465.625.650', 'C04.557.580.625.650']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1544,Early experience with the GIFT procedure.,"Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) was performed in 19 cycles on 15 couples whose infertility had proven resistant to other treatments. Indications included infertility associated with immunologic factors, seminal deficiencies, endometriosis and infertility without a diagnosed etiology. Any history or finding of tubal disease served as an exclusion. Infertility was primary in ten couples and secondary in five, three of whom had conceived previously with a semen donor. Stimulation protocols included clomiphene citrate (CC) and human menopausal gonadotropins, CC alone and gonadotropins alone. Males were screened with the hamster egg sperm penetration assay. Four conceptions were recorded, and three are ongoing. Advantages of this procedure include acceptance by the major orthodox religions, avoidance of extracorporeal incubation and physiologic entry of the embryo into the uterine cavity. Disadvantages include the inability to determine if fertilization has occurred in the absence of pregnancy, the theoretical risk of increased ectopic gestation and tubal infection, and perhaps an increase in multiple gestations.","['Adult', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Fallopian Tubes', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female', 'Infertility, Male', 'Laparoscopy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognosis']",2940366,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D06.472.699.322.326', 'D06.472.699.649.367', 'D12.644.548.726.367', 'D12.776.780.400'], ['A05.360.319.114.373', 'A13.706.500'], ['E02.875.800.750', 'E05.820.800.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C13.351.500.365.700'], ['C12.294.365.700'], ['E01.370.388.250.520', 'E04.502.250.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E01.789']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
19820,Postprogression survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: rationale for second-line trial design.,"UNLABELLED: Sorafenib improves overall survival (OS) of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the absence of objective response. Thus, time to tumor progression (TTP) is used to capture benefits of novel molecular agents, but proof of its surrogacy with survival is lacking. Furthermore, survival predictors upon progression are not established and there is a need to characterize postprogression survival (PPS) and assess with time-dependent covariates analysis if it is influenced by progression pattern, and not solely by simultaneous impairment of liver function and performance status. We prospectively followed HCC patients treated with sorafenib. Clinical and biochemical evaluation were done every 4 weeks. Radiologic assessment of progression was done at week 4 and then every 8 weeks using RECIST 1.1. The progression pattern was divided into: intrahepatic/extrahepatic increase in tumor size, new intrahepatic lesion, and new extrahepatic lesion (NEH). We included 147 patients (hepatitis C virus [HCV] 57.1%, performance status [PS] 0 83.6%, Child-Pugh A 82.3%, and BCLC-C 47.3%). The median OS was 12.7 months and its independent predictors (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI]) were: baseline BCLC 2.49 [1.66-3.73], PS 1.86 [1.12-3.10], registration during follow-up of Child-Pugh B or Child-Pugh C scores (2.36 [1.51-3.69] and 2.89 [1.62-5.15], respectively), definitive sorafenib interruption 2.48 [1.54-4.01], and TTP 3.39 [1.89-6.1]. The presence of NEH 2.42 [1.32-4.44] is also an independent predictor of OS and PPS in patients with radiologic progression.CONCLUSION: Tumor progression is a surrogate of survival but its impact varies according to progression pattern. Thus, PPS is influenced by progression pattern and this is key in prognostic prediction and second-line trial design and analysis.","['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Niacinamide', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiography', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sorafenib', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",23787822,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.066.515.530', 'D03.383.725.547.530'], ['D02.065.950.681', 'D02.455.426.559.389.703'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E01.370.350.700'], ['E05.318.372.250.250.365.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250.365.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250.365.500'], ['D02.065.950.681.757', 'D02.455.426.559.389.703.757', 'D03.066.515.530.750', 'D03.383.725.547.530.750'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
19292,The prognostic significance of vasohibin-1 expression in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma.,"PURPOSE: Vasohibin-1 (VASH1) is a novel angiogenic molecule that is specifically expressed in activated vascular endothelial cells, and the status of VASH1 expression has been documented in cancer angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to address the prognostic value of VASH1 expression in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of 171 patients with locally advanced UTUC (Ta-3N0M0). The median follow-up period was 3.8 years. We immunohistochemically examined the accomplished microvessels with anti-CD34 as microvessel density (MVD) and the microvessels with activated endothelial cells as VASH1 density. Then, we analyzed the association between immunohistochemical expression and clinical outcomes.RESULTS: Forty-two patients experienced tumor recurrence and of these 34 died of the disease during follow-up. VASH1 density was significantly associated with tumor grade, pathologic T stage, and MVD. The 5-year recurrence-free and cancer-specific survival rates were 66.1% and 72.8% in patients with VASH1 density (? 40/mm(2)) and 81.0% and 86.5% in their counterparts, respectively (P < 0.05). MVD was not an independent predictor of tumor recurrence or cancer-specific survival. Multivariate analyses revealed that high VASH1 density was an independent prognostic indicator of both tumor recurrence (P = 0.024, HR = 2.10) and cancer-specific survival (P = 0.031, HR = 2.23) as well as other standard prognostic factors including high tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion.CONCLUSIONS: VASH1 density represents a clinically relevant predictor of patient prognosis in UTUC. The results suggest that VASH1 density could become a new biomarker and provide additional prognostic information in patients with UTUC.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Microvessels', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Urologic Neoplasms']",22675166,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D23.050.301.264.035.134', 'D23.101.100.110.134'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C04.557.470.200.430'], ['D12.776.167'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['A07.015.461'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['E01.789.612'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['G01.910.857'], ['C04.588.945.947', 'C12.758.820', 'C13.351.937.820']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
20459,[Omega-3 fatty acids and astaxanthin in health and disease. Recent knowledges].,"At present, medicine is aimed to the treatment of lesions. Instead, it would be right to develop the maintenance of normal health. A number of authorities have recently recommended increases in intake of omega-3 fatty acids and astaxanthin for the health of general population. Omega-3 are necessary to provide the optimal function of cellular membrane in health and in disease states. It is well known how at least two servings of fish a week, or dietary supplementation of fatty acids omega-3, should be taken to obtain the health benefits of this essential nutrient.

Test and control teeth were suspended in an experimental bacterial leakage setup for 50 days. Kaplan-Meyer curves showed a tendency of the gutta-percha/AH Plus root fillings to prevent leakage better than Resilon/Epiphany counterparts. This tendency, however, was not statistically significant (log-rank test, p = 0.141). The estimated mean time for turbidity to occur in the broth below the suspended root was 35 days (SD = 5 days) in the gutta-percha/AH Plus and 33 days (SD = 4 days) in the Resilon/Epiphany group. It was concluded that within the limitations of this study, there was no apparent advantage of using Resilon/Epiphany over gutta-percha/AH Plus.","['Dental Leakage', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Epoxy Resins', 'Gutta-Percha', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Root Canal Filling Materials', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",17185129,"[['C07.793.221'], ['B03.353.750.250.250.280', 'B03.510.550.250.250.280'], ['D05.750.716.822.461', 'D25.720.716.822.461', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.461'], ['D20.215.721.061', 'D25.339.859.495', 'D25.720.327.840.119', 'J01.637.051.339.859.495'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['D25.339.859', 'J01.637.051.339.859'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

22900,Structural stigma and sexual orientation-related reproductive health disparities in a longitudinal cohort study of female adolescents.,"INTRODUCTION: Sexual minority female adolescents have worse reproductive health than heterosexual peers; research into the origins of these disparities is limited. Our objective was to examine whether exposure to structural stigma (e.g., societal-level conditions, cultural norms, institutional policies/practices that constrain the lives of the stigmatized) is associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and teen pregnancy in sexual minority female adolescents.METHODS: Longitudinal data were utilized from 6581 female adolescents aged 9-14 years at baseline (1996) in the U.S.-based Growing Up Today Study and followed through 2007. We used a previously-validated structural stigma scale composed of four state-level items (e.g., employment non-discrimination policies) with one item added relevant to reproductive health. Risk ratios were generated from multivariate models.RESULTS: Sexual minority female adolescents were significantly more likely than heterosexual peers to have an STI diagnosis and teen pregnancy. Sexual minority female adolescents living in states with lower, compared to higher, levels of structural stigma were significantly less likely to have an STI diagnosis, after adjustment for individual- and state-level covariates (relative risk [RR] = 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51, 0.97). In contrast, among completely heterosexual adolescents, structural stigma was not associated with STI diagnosis. Teen pregnancy risk-a rare outcome-did not vary by level of structural stigma for sexual minority or heterosexual adolescents.CONCLUSIONS: Structural stigma is a potential risk factor for adverse reproductive health among sexual minority female adolescents. Changing laws and policies to be inclusive of all people, regardless of sexual orientation, can help alleviate entrenched reproductive health disparities.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproductive Health', 'Risk Factors', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Social Stigma']",31238178,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['I01.240.425.675', 'N01.224.425.437', 'N06.850.505.400.425.675'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['N01.400.625'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.802'], ['M01.777'], ['F01.145.813.840']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
26194,Eighteen-point abobotulinum toxin a upper face rejuvenation: an eye plastic perspective on 845 subjects.,"PURPOSE: To report the method and results of 18-point Abobotulinum toxin A (ABO-BTA, Dysport) upper face rejuvenation on 845 subjects.METHODS: In a retrospective chart review, all subjects (the first cycle of injection) with ABO-BTA upper face rejuvenation from 2003 to 2009 were included. Excluded were subjects with facial spastic disorders, injection after upper face lifting, and aberrant regeneration of facial nerves. Upper face rejuvenation included 18 points of injection at forehead creases (4), frown lines (5), bunny line (1), crow's feet (4 on both sides), and lower eyelid crease (4 on both sides). They were revisited in 10 to 14 days for assessment of the effects and possible touch-up injection. Demographics, year of injection, topical anesthetic usage, touch-up injection, and adverse effects (AE) were recorded.RESULTS: There were 845 subjects (85.8% women) whose age was below 40 in 49.3%. All but 68 (8%) were happy with the touch-up visit, 10 to 14 days after injection. Touch-up injection was performed in 8% of subjects mainly for the eyebrow asymmetry. AE (22/845, 2.6%) were bruise (15/845, 1.8%), blepharoptosis (3/845, 0.3%), remained eyebrow asymmetry after touch-up injection (2/845, 0.2%), and headache (2/845, 0.2%). They were significantly more in subjects with touch-up injection, younger than 40 years, and in the first and second year of experience (especially for the bruise).CONCLUSIONS: Eighteen-point ABO-BTA upper face rejuvenation had a low rate of AE in this series in which majority was bruise at the lateral canthal area. They were significantly more in the first years of experience, subjects younger than 40, and who had touch-up injections.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Botulinum Toxins, Type A', 'Eyebrows', 'Eyelids', 'Facial Muscles', 'Female', 'Forehead', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intradermal', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuromuscular Agents', 'Orbit', 'Rejuvenation', 'Rhytidoplasty', 'Skin', 'Skin Aging', 'Young Adult']",24481513,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.153.100', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.153.100', 'D12.776.097.156.100', 'D23.946.123.179.050'], ['A01.456.505.420.338', 'A17.360.296'], ['A01.456.505.420.504', 'A09.371.337'], ['A02.633.567.400', 'A14.363'], ['A01.456.505.580'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.530.620.410'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D27.505.696.663.700'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.690'], ['E02.849'], ['E02.218.765', 'E04.680.275.700'], ['A17.815'], ['G13.750.804'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
9977,Relational diagnosis: a coconstructive-developmental perspective on assessment and treatment.,"As we expand the borders of traditional diagnostic nomenclature, distinguishing health from disorder becomes complex. This is especially true when the diagnostic lens views individuals as they exist within families that reside within wider social milieus. From this viewpoint, the recursive and interdependent factors influencing how individuals, relationships, and wider collectives contribute to and construe disorder need to be determined Systemic Cognitive-Developmental Therapy is one approach to conducting viable relational diagnoses and treatment, guiding therapists to formulate an understanding of the internal cognitive-developmental resources available to clients and other relevant, interdependent systems, and to examine the forces influencing the interactive discourse across these systems. The constructs of worldview, information processing styles, power differentials, and interpersonal connectiveness are presented as conceptual tools to guide relational diagnosis.

4568,Knowledge and attitudes about urinary incontinence among community-dwelling Korean American women.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore knowledge and attitudes about urinary incontinence (UI) among Korean American women with incontinence and provide initial information needed to design education programs and culture-specific interventions.SUBJECTS AND SETTING: One hundred eighty-two community-dwelling Korean American women who were 30 years and older and self-identified as having UI were invited to participate in the study. Data collection was conducted in 12 Korean religious organizations.DESIGN: This study uses a cross-sectional descriptive design by means of interviews.INSTRUMENTS: The Incontinence Quiz was used to measure knowledge and attitudes about UI. Higher scores indicate greater knowledge and more positive attitudes.RESULTS: The mean Incontinence Quiz was 4.85 (SD = 2.75) out of 14, which was much lower than the midpoint of 7.0, indicating that respondents tended to have limited knowledge and negative attitudes toward UI. The number of correct responses to the items on the Incontinence Quiz in this sample was lower than that reported in other studies that sampled the general population.CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to improve Korean women's knowledge of, and attitudes toward, UI are needed. WOC and continence nurses should take an active role in educating women about the prevention and treatment of UI.","['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Arizona', 'Asian Americans', 'Attitude to Health', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cultural Competency', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Korea', 'Middle Aged', 'Needs Assessment', ""Nurse's Role"", 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Self Care', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Women']",19287269,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['Z01.107.567.875.760.100'], ['M01.686.508.200.100', 'M01.686.754.225'], ['F01.100.150', 'N05.300.150'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['I01.880.853.100.364'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.474.557', 'Z01.586.407'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I02.594', 'N03.349.380.565', 'N05.300.537'], ['F01.829.316.616.625.450', 'N05.300.100.337'], ['H01.770.644.145.390.634', 'H02.478.395.634', 'N04.590.233.508.613.634'], ['I02.233.332.500', 'N02.421.726.407.680'], ['E02.900', 'I03.050.563', 'N02.421.784.680'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['C12.777.934.852', 'C13.351.968.934.814', 'C23.888.942.343.800'], ['M01.975']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
47729,Risk factors for mortality in lower intestinal bleeding.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous studies of lower intestinal bleeding (LIB) have limited power to study mortality. We sought to identify characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality in a large cohort of patients with LIB.METHODS: We used the 2002 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample to study a cross-sectional cohort of 227,022 hospitalized patients with discharge diagnoses indicating LIB. Predictors of mortality were identified by using multiple logistic regression.RESULTS: In 2002, an estimated 8737 patients with LIB (3.9%) died while hospitalized. Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were age (age >70 vs <50 years; odds ratio [OR], 4.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.45-9.87), intestinal ischemia (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.57-4.68), comorbid illness (>or=2 vs 0 comorbidities, OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 2.25-3.98), bleeding while hospitalized for a separate process (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.81-3.04), coagulation defects (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.50-3.65), hypovolemia (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.69-2.90), transfusion of packed red blood cells (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.23-2.08), and male gender (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.21-1.92). Colorectal polyps (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15-0.45), and hemorrhoids (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.28-0.64) were associated with a lower risk of mortality, as was diagnostic testing for LIB when added to the multivariate model (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.28-0.48). Hospital characteristics were not significantly related to mortality. Predictors of mortality were similar in an analysis restricted to patients with diverticular bleeding.CONCLUSIONS: The all-cause in-hospital mortality rate in LIB was low (3.9%). Advanced age, intestinal ischemia, and comorbid illness were the strongest predictors of mortality.","['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Hypovolemia', 'Ischemia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Transfusion Reaction']",18558513,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C15.378.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C06.405.469.158'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['C06.405.227', 'C23.550.414.788'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.455'], ['C23.550.513'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['C15.378.962', 'C20.920']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

47884,Staphylococcus aureus â-toxin production is common in strains with the â-toxin gene inactivated by bacteriophage.,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus causes life-threatening infections, including infective endocarditis, sepsis, and pneumonia. â-toxin is a sphingomyelinase encoded for by virtually all S. aureus strains and exhibits human immune cell cytotoxicity. The toxin enhances S. aureus phenol-soluble modulin activity, and its activity is enhanced by superantigens. The bacteriophage öSa3 inserts into the â-toxin gene in human strains, inactivating it in the majority of S. aureus clonal groups. Hence, most strains are reported not to secrete â-toxin.METHODS: This dynamic was investigated by examining â-toxin production by multiple clonal groups of S. aureus, both in vitro and in vivo during infections in rabbit models of infective endocarditis, sepsis, and pneumonia.RESULTS: â-toxin phenotypic variants are common among strains containing öSa3. In vivo, öSa3 is differentially induced in heart vegetations, kidney abscesses, and ischemic liver compared to spleen and blood, and in vitro growth in liquid culture. Furthermore, in pneumonia, wild-type â-toxin production leads to development of large caseous lesions, and in infective endocarditis, increases the size of pathognomonic vegetations.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the dynamic interaction between S. aureus and the infected host, where öSa3 serves as a regulator of virulence gene expression, and increased fitness and virulence in new environments.","['Animals', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endocarditis, Bacterial', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hemolysin Proteins', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Pneumonia, Staphylococcal', 'Prophages', 'Rabbits', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sepsis', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase', 'Staphylococcus Phages', 'Staphylococcus aureus']",24620023,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.946.123'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['C01.150.252.245', 'C01.190.249', 'C14.260.249', 'C14.280.282.407'], ['G05.308.203.374'], ['D12.776.543.695.444'], ['E05.393.420.601.550', 'G05.365.590.575', 'G05.558.550'], ['C01.150.252.410.868.675', 'C01.150.252.620.620', 'C01.748.610.540.620', 'C08.381.677.540.620', 'C08.730.610.540.620'], ['B04.123.655'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['G05.728'], ['C01.757', 'C23.550.470.790.500'], ['D08.811.277.352.640.750'], ['B04.123.831'], ['B03.300.390.400.800.750.100', 'B03.353.500.750.750.100', 'B03.510.100.750.750.100', 'B03.510.400.790.750.100']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
42345,Further studies on bacteriophage T4 DNA synthesis in sucrose-plasmolyzed cells.,"This paper describes several technical improvements in the sucrose-plasmolyzed cell system used in earlier experiments on DNA synthesis in situ with Escherichia coli infected by DNA-defective mutants of bacteriophage T4 (W. L. Collinsworth and C. K. Mathews, J. Virol. 13:908-915, 1974). Using this system, which is based primarily on that of M. G. Wovcha et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 70:2196-2200, 1973), we reinvestigated the properties of mutants bearing lesions in genes 1, 41, and 62, and we resolved some disagreements with data reported from that laboratory. We also asked whether the DNA-delay phenotype of T4 mutants is related to possible early leakage of DNA precursors from infected cells. Such cells display defective DNA synthesis in situ, even when ample DNA precursors are made available. Thus, the lesions associated with these mutations seem to manifest themselves at the level of macromolecular metabolism. Similarly, we examined an E. coli mutant defective in its ability to support T4 production, apparently because of a lesion affecting DNA synthesis (L. Simon et al., Nature [London] 252:451-455). In the plasmolyzed cell system, reduced nucleotide incorporation is seen, indicating also that the genetic defect does not involve DNA precursor synthesis. The plasmolyzed cell system incorporates deoxynucleotide 5'-monophosphates into DNA severalfold more rapidly than the corresponding 5'-triphosphates. This is consistent with the idea that DNA precursor-synthesizing enzymes are functionally organized to shuttle substrates to their sites of utilization.","['Coliphages', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral', 'Deoxyribonucleotides', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genes', 'Mutation', 'Osmosis', 'Phenotype', 'Sucrose']",328926,"[['B04.123.205'], ['A11.284.430.214'], ['G02.111.225', 'G05.226'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['D13.695.201'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G05.360.340.024.340'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G01.154.090.750', 'G02.111.655', 'G02.691', 'G02.723.495'], ['G05.695'], ['D09.698.629.305.770', 'D09.947.750.770']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
38205,Serum amyloid P component binds to histones and activates the classical complement pathway.,"Two members of the pentraxin family of proteins, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P component (SAP), bind to chromatin and may be involved in the solubilization and clearance of nuclear material. Previous studies demonstrated that CRP binding to chromatin is mediated by histones. SAP differs from CRP in being able to bind to DNA, but SAP binding to histones has not been reported. CRP is an activator of the classical C pathway, and C-dependent cleavage of chromatin in the presence of CRP and serum has been shown. Oligomers of SAP have recently been found to bind to C1q and consume total C and C4, indicating that SAP can activate C as well. The present study examined CRP and SAP binding to histones H1 and H2A and C activation after binding. SAP binding to histones H1 and H2A was observed as well as SAP binding to chromatin. In contrast to CRP, SAP binding to chromatin did not require H1. SAP partially inhibited CRP binding to chromatin and to H1. However, neither pentraxin inhibited binding of the other to H2A. Binding of either CRP or SAP to H2A activated C in SAP-depleted serum leading to the deposition of C4 and C3. C activation required C1q and produced C4d indicating that it occurred through the classical pathway. These findings demonstrate that CRP and SAP share histone as well as chromatin binding, and that both pentraxins can activate the classical C pathway after ligand binding.","['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'C-Reactive Protein', 'Complement C1q', 'Complement C4', 'Complement Pathway, Classical', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Protein Binding', 'Serum Amyloid P-Component']",1431140,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['D12.776.034.145', 'D12.776.124.050.120', 'D12.776.124.486.157'], ['D12.776.124.486.274.050.270'], ['D12.776.124.486.274.350'], ['G12.274.698'], ['D12.776.157.687.485', 'D12.776.660.720.485', 'D12.776.664.469'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D12.776.049.407.875', 'D12.776.124.050.730', 'D12.776.395.690']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
34348,1HNMR-Based metabolomic profiling method to develop plasma biomarkers for sensitivity to chronic heat stress in growing pigs.,"The negative impact of heat stress (HS) on the production performances in pig faming is of particular concern. Novel diagnostic methods are needed to predict the robustness of pigs to HS. Our study aimed to assess the reliability of blood metabolome to predict the sensitivity to chronic HS of 10 F1 (Large White ? Creole) sire families (SF) reared in temperate (TEMP) and in tropical (TROP) regions (n = 56±5 offsprings/region/SF). Live body weight (BW) and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded at 23 weeks of age. Average daily feed intake (AFDI) and average daily gain were calculated from weeks 11 to 23 of age, together with feed conversion ratio. Plasma blood metabolome profiles were obtained by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (1HNMR) from blood samples collected at week 23 in TEMP. The sensitivity to hot climatic conditions of each SF was estimated by computing a composite index of sensitivity (Isens) derived from a linear combination of t statistics applied to familial BW, ADFI and RT in TEMP and TROP climates. A model of prediction of sensitivity was established with sparse Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) between the two most robust SF (n = 102) and the two most sensitive ones (n = 121) using individual metabolomic profiles measured in TEMP. The sPLS-DA selected 29 buckets that enabled 78% of prediction accuracy by cross-validation. On the basis of this training, we predicted the proportion of sensitive pigs within the 6 remaining families (n = 337). This proportion was defined as the predicted membership of families to the sensitive category. The positive correlation between this proportion and Isens (r = 0.97, P < 0.01) suggests that plasma metabolome can be used to predict the sensitivity of pigs to hot climate.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Body Temperature Regulation', 'Climate', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Metabolomics', 'Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Swine']",29176781,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.101'], ['G07.110.232', 'G07.410.421', 'G16.012.500.535'], ['G16.500.275.071', 'N06.230.300.100.250'], ['C26.522'], ['H01.158.201.586', 'H01.158.273.180.599', 'H01.181.122.638'], ['E05.196.867.519.775'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
31245,Comparison of Ocular Pulse Amplitude Lowering Effects of Preservative-Free Tafluprost and Preservative-Free Dorzolamide-Timolol Fixed Combination Eyedrops.,"PURPOSE: To compare the ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) lowering effects of preservative-free tafluprost and dorzolamide-timolol fixed combination (DTFC) using dynamic contour tonometry.METHODS: In total, 66 eyes of 66 patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG) (n = 34) or primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) (n = 32) were included. Patients were divided into two groups: the preservative-free tafluprost-treated group (n = 33) and the preservative-free DTFC-treated group (n = 33). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT). OPA was measured using dynamic contour tonometry; corrected OPA (cOPA) was calculated at baseline and at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment.RESULTS: After 6 months of treatment, tafluprost significantly reduced IOP (P < 0.001). The OPA lowering effects differed significantly between the two treatment groups (P = 0.003). The cOPA-lowering effect of tafluprost (1.09 mmHg) was significantly greater than that of DTFC (0.36 mmHg) after 6 months of treatment (P = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Tafluprost and DTFC glaucoma treatments provided marked OPA and IOP lowering effects. Tafluprost had a greater effect than DTFC; thus, this drug is recommended for patients at risk of glaucoma progression, due to the high OPA caused by large fluctuations in IOP.","['Drug Combinations', 'Eye', 'Female', 'Glaucoma, Open-Angle', 'Humans', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Low Tension Glaucoma', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Ophthalmic Solutions', 'Preservatives, Pharmaceutical', 'Prostaglandins F', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sulfonamides', 'Thiophenes', 'Timolol', 'Tonometry, Ocular']",26557671,"[['D26.310'], ['A01.456.505.420', 'A09.371'], ['C11.525.381.407'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G14.440'], ['C11.525.381.703', 'C11.640.225'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C11.525'], ['D26.776.708.645', 'D27.505.954.578.645', 'D27.720.752.608'], ['D26.650.702', 'D27.720.744.771'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.400', 'D23.469.050.175.725.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['D02.065.884', 'D02.886.590.700'], ['D02.886.778', 'D03.383.903'], ['D02.033.100.624.915', 'D02.033.755.624.915', 'D02.092.063.624.915', 'D02.886.675.867.768', 'D03.383.129.708.867.768', 'D03.383.533.640.775'], ['E01.370.380.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Administration of 500 mg aspirin twice daily caused a sustained reduction in the excretion of 2,3-dinor-TxB2 to 10-15% of the predose value, while the excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha was reduced for only about 3 hours after the aspirin dose.

40426,Acute facial palsy in children--a 2-year follow-up study with focus on Lyme neuroborreliosis.,"OBJECTIVE: Acute facial palsy in children is believed to be a rather benign neurological condition. Follow-up-studies are sparse, especially including a thorough otoneurological re-examination. The aim of this study was to examine children with a history of facial palsy in order to register the incidence of complete recovery and the severity and nature of sequelae. We also wanted to investigate whether there was a correlation between sequelae and Lyme Borreliosis, treatment or other health problems.METHODS: Twenty-seven children with a history of facial palsy were included. A re-examination was performed by an Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT) specialist 1-2.9 years (median 2) after the acute facial palsy. The otoneurological examination included grading the three branches of the facial nerve with the House-Brackman score, otomicroscopy and investigation with Frenzel glasses. A paediatrician interviewed the families. Medical files were analysed.RESULT: The incidence of complete recovery was 78% at the 2-year follow-up. In six out of 27 children (22%), the facial nerve function was mildly or moderately impaired. Four children reported problems with tear secretion and pronunciation. There was no correlation between sequelae after the facial palsy and gender, age, related symptoms, Lyme neuroborreliosis (NB), treatment, other health problems or performance.CONCLUSION: One fifth of children with an acute facial palsy get a permanent dysfunction of the facial nerve. Other neurological symptoms or health problems do not accompany the sequelae of the facial palsy. Lyme NB or treatment seems to have no correlation to clinical outcome. Factors of importance for complete recovery after an acute facial palsy are still not known.","['Adolescent', 'Borrelia', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Facial Nerve', 'Facial Paralysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lyme Neuroborreliosis', 'Male', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Recovery of Function', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors']",12745151,"[['M01.060.057'], ['B03.440.425.410.711.193', 'B03.851.595.193'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['A08.800.050.050.275', 'A08.800.050.600.149', 'A08.800.800.060.275', 'A08.800.800.120.250'], ['C07.465.327', 'C10.597.622.214', 'C23.888.592.636.214'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C01.150.252.223.437', 'C01.150.252.400.536.700', 'C01.150.252.400.794.352.250.700', 'C01.207.180.437', 'C01.920.930.513.700', 'C10.228.228.180.437'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['G16.757'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
18566,A reverse genetics system for Borna disease virus.,"Borna disease virus (BDV) is an enveloped virus. Its non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA genome has the coding capability for six main polypeptides and has an organization characteristic of members of the order Mononegavirales. However, based on its unique genetics and biological features, BDV is considered to be the prototypic member of a new virus family, Bornaviridae. Here, the establishment of a reverse genetics system for BDV is described. Intracellular synthesis of a BDV RNA analogue or minigenome (MG) from a plasmid was driven by RNA polymerase I. Co-transfection with plasmids expressing the BDV polymerase (L), nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) under the control of RNA polymerase II allowed for BDV MG replication and expression. This process depended on a delicate N:P ratio, whereas the L:P ratio was less critical. Two isoforms of N, Np40 and Np38, are present in BDV-infected cells but only Np40 was strictly required for virus polymerase activity. BDV p10 polypeptide encoded by the P gene exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on BDV MG expression.","['Animals', 'Borna disease virus', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Genome, Viral', 'RNA, Viral', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viral Structural Proteins', 'Virus Replication']",14573815,"[['B01.050'], ['B04.820.480.937.149.135'], ['A11.251.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['G05.360.340.358.840'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D12.776.964'], ['D12.776.964.970'], ['G06.920.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
40498,Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) expression in human colorectal cancer tissues.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) functions specifically to induce lymphangiogenesis. We examined the relationship between expression of VEGF-C and clinicopathological features in patients with colorectal cancer. The expression of VEGF-C in the 99 primary tumours and 18 metastatic lymph nodes from colorectal cancer patients was examined immunohistochemically. To verify VEGF-C mRNA expression, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out. The expression of VEGF-C correlated with lymphatic involvement, lymph nodes metastasis, and depth of invasion. On the other hand, correlations were nil with regard to gender of the patients, histologic type, venous involvement, and liver metastasis. The expression of VEGF-C in metastatic lymph nodes was fairly consistent with this expression in the primary tumour. Survival time was shorter for VEGF-C positive groups than for VEGF-C negative ones, but with no statistically significant difference. RT-PCR findings revealed that the expression of VEGF-C mRNA correlated mostly with that of VEGF-C protein expression. VEGF-C may play an important role in lymphatic spread of colorectal cancer.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C']",10970690,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['D12.644.276.390', 'D12.776.467.390', 'D23.529.390'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.400', 'D12.776.467.100.800.400', 'D23.529.100.800.400']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

43760,Chemoprophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in otolaryngology.,"IMPORTANCE: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) causes significant morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. Despite strong evidence that thromboprophylaxis reduces the incidence VTE, guidelines for prophylaxis in otolaryngology are not well established. Key to the development of VTE prophylaxis recommendations are effective VTE risk stratification and evaluation of the benefits and harms of prophylaxis.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of VTE chemoprophylaxis among a population of otolaryngology patients stratified by risk.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of 3498 adult patients admitted for otolaryngologic surgery at a single-institution academic tertiary care medical center between September 1, 2003, and June 30, 2010.INTERVENTIONS: Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on whether they received VTE chemoprophylaxis.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of VTE and bleeding-related complications within 30 days after surgery.RESULTS: Of 1482 patients receiving VTE chemoprophylaxis, 18 (1.2%) developed a VTE compared with 27 of 2016 patients (1.3%) who did not receive prophylaxis (P = .75). Patients with Caprini VTE risk scores greater than 7 were less likely to have a VTE with perioperative chemoprophylaxis (5.3% vs 10.4%; P = .06). Of patients with VTE chemoprophylaxis, 3.5% developed a bleeding complication compared with 1.2% of patients without prophylaxis (P < .001). Bleeding complications were associated with concomitant use of antiplatelet medications and chemoprophylaxis. Among patients undergoing free tissue transfer, chemoprophylaxis significantly decreased the incidence of VTE (2.1% vs 7.7%; P = .002) and increased bleeding complications (11.9% vs 4.5%; P = .01). In all other patients, VTE chemoprophylaxis did not significantly influence the likelihood of VTE (1.0% vs 0.6%; P = .12) or bleeding (1.5% vs 0.9%; P = .15).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Effectiveness and safety of VTE chemoprophylaxis differed between patient subgroups, defined by Caprini risk score and by procedure. Effectiveness was most evident in patients with high Caprini risk scores and microvascular free tissue reconstruction.

21936,Increased risk of pancreatic cancer in melanoma-prone kindreds with p16INK4 mutations.,"BACKGROUND: A gene on chromosome 9p, p16INK4, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cutaneous malignant melanoma in 19 melanoma-prone families. In 10 of these kindreds mutations that impaired the function of the p16INK4 protein (p16M alleles) cosegregated with the disease. By contrast, in the other nine kindreds the mutation did not alter the function of p16INK4 (p16W alleles). We looked for differences in clinical and genetic epidemiologic features in these two groups of families.METHODS: We compared the median ages at diagnosis of melanoma, number of melanomas, thickness of the tumors, and number of nevi in the kindreds. We estimated prospectively the risks of melanoma or other cancers in families followed for 6 to 18 years and the risks of other cancers since 1925 (the entire period) by comparing the number of cancer cases observed with the number expected.RESULTS: The risk of invasive melanoma was increased by a factor of 75 in kindreds with p16M alleles and a factor of 38 in kindreds with p16W alleles. Although this difference was not significant (P = 0.14), there was a striking difference in the risk of other tumors. In kindreds with p16M alleles, the risk of pancreatic cancer was increased by a factor of 13 in the prospective period (2 cases observed, 0.15 expected; standardized incidence ratio, 13.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 47.4) and by a factor of 22 in the entire period (7 cases observed, 0.32 expected; standardized incidence ratio, 21.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 8.7 to 44.8). In contrast, we found no cases of pancreatic cancer in kindred with p16W alleles.CONCLUSIONS: The development of pancreatic cancer in kindreds prone to melanoma may require a p16M mutation. Genetic factors, such as the kind of mutation found in p16INK4, may explain the inconsistent occurrence of other cancers in these kindreds.","['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Pedigree', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Skin Neoplasms']",7666916,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.325.345', 'G05.360.162.520.300.325.345'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510', 'C04.557.665.510'], ['G05.365.590'], ['C04.700', 'C16.320.700'], ['C04.588.274.761', 'C04.588.322.475', 'C06.301.761', 'C06.689.667', 'C19.344.421'], ['E05.393.673'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800', 'G17.680.750', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800'], ['C04.588.805', 'C17.800.882']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
17708,Hang Them High: A Hands-Free Technique for Upper Extremity Limb Holding During Surgical Preparation.,"Lifting and holding upper and lower limbs during the ""prep and drape"" portion of certain orthopaedic procedures exert strong forces on the holder and may lead to musculoskeletal disorders. To address these challenges during upper extremity procedures, this article describes a hand-free elevation and traction technique of the upper limbs during preoperative skin preparation with the use of items readily available within the operating room (OR). This technique is particularly useful for heavy or fractured limbs that may impose a physical challenge to lift and maintain in a stable position. Implementation of this technique reduces the risk to nurses, OR personnel, and caregivers of developing work-related musculoskeletal injuries while lifting and holding limbs in the orthopaedic OR.","['Bandages', 'Extremities', 'Humans', 'Immobilization', 'Lifting', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Preoperative Care', 'Upper Extremity']",27851674,"[['E07.101'], ['A01.378'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.472'], ['G01.374.669'], ['E02.718', 'E04.555'], ['E02.760.795', 'E04.604.750', 'N02.421.585.795'], ['A01.378.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
23033,"The B subunit of an AB5 toxin produced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi up-regulates chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion molecules in human macrophage, colonic epithelial, and brain microvascular endothelial cell lines.","The principal function of bacterial AB5 toxin B subunits is to interact with glycan receptors on the surfaces of target cells and mediate the internalization of holotoxin. However, B subunit-receptor interactions also have the potential to impact cell signaling pathways and, in so doing, contribute to pathogenesis independently of the catalytic (toxic) A subunits. Various Salmonella enterica serovars, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, encode an AB5 toxin (ArtAB), the A subunit of which is an ADP-ribosyltransferase related to the S1 subunit of pertussis toxin. However, although the A subunit is able to catalyze ADP-ribosylation of host G proteins, a cytotoxic phenotype has yet to be identified for the holotoxin. We therefore examined the capacity of the purified B subunit (ArtB) from S. Typhi to elicit cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule responses in human macrophage (U937), colonic epithelial (HCT-8) cell, and brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) lines. Secretion of the chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) was increased in all three tested cell lines, with macrophage inflammatory protein 1á (MIP-1á), MIP-1â, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) also significantly increased in U937 cells. ArtB also upregulated the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-á) and IL-6 in HBMECs and HCT-8 cells, but not in U937 cells, while intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was upregulated in HCT-8 and U937 cells and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) was upregulated in HBMECs. Thus, ArtB may contribute to pathogenesis independently of the A subunit by promoting and maintaining a strong inflammatory response at the site of infection.","['Bacterial Toxins', 'Brain', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Macrophages', 'Protein Subunits', 'Salmonella typhi']",23250951,"[['D23.946.123'], ['A08.186.211'], ['G04.022'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['A11.436.275'], ['A11.436'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['D12.776.813'], ['B03.440.450.425.800.200.800', 'B03.660.250.150.710.160.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

39995,Color vision in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a pilot visual evoked potential study.,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are reported to manifest visual problems (including ophthalmological and color perception, particularly for blue-yellow stimuli), but findings are inconsistent. Accordingly, this study investigated visual function and color perception in adolescents with ADHD using color Visual Evoked Potentials (cVEP), which provides an objective measure of color perception.METHOD: Thirty-one adolescents (aged 13-18), 16 with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, and 15 healthy peers, matched for age, gender, and IQ participated in the study. All underwent an ophthalmological exam, as well as electrophysiological testing color Visual Evoked Potentials (cVEP), which measured the latency and amplitude of the neural P1 response to chromatic (blue-yellow, red-green) and achromatic stimuli.RESULT: No intergroup differences were found in the ophthalmological exam. However, significantly larger P1 amplitude was found for blue and yellow stimuli, but not red/green or achromatic stimuli, in the ADHD group (particularly in the medicated group) compared to controls.CONCLUSION: Larger amplitude in the P1 component for blue-yellow in the ADHD group compared to controls may account for the lack of difference in color perception tasks. We speculate that the larger amplitude for blue-yellow stimuli in early sensory processing (P1) might reflect a compensatory strategy for underlying problems including compromised retinal input of s-cones due to hypo-dopaminergic tone.","['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Color Perception', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Evoked Potentials, Visual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Refraction, Ocular', 'Visual Acuity']",25435188,"[['M01.060.057'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['F03.625.094.150'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['F02.463.593.932.217'], ['E01.370.380.850.950.500', 'F02.463.593.778.435.110', 'F02.463.593.932.281', 'F02.463.593.932.901.500', 'G14.940.500'], ['G07.265.216.500.425', 'G11.561.200.500.425', 'G14.330'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.723.729'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['E01.370.380.850.700', 'G01.590.775', 'G14.760'], ['E01.370.380.850.950', 'F02.463.593.932.901', 'G14.940']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
4399,"Effect of alpha-interferon, 17 beta-estradiol, and tamoxifen on estrogen receptor concentration and cell cycle kinetics of MCF 7 cells.","The interaction of alpha-interferon, 17 beta-estradiol, and tamoxifen on estrogen receptor content, growth fraction, proliferative rate, and total protein synthesis of MCF 7 cells was investigated under culture conditions (minus phenol red and at low concentrations of ""stripped"" fetal calf serum) allowing for direct stimulation of proliferation by estrogens. Exposure to estradiol alone resulted in a decrease of estrogen receptor content as measured by immunoassay, an increase of the proportion of cells in S phase, and increases in cell proliferation as well as total protein synthesis. alpha-Interferon treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest with reduced proliferation, an increase of estrogen receptor content, but a decrease in the rate of total protein synthesis. Pretreatment with alpha-interferon inhibited the estrogen induced stimulation of cell growth as well as the associated decrease of estrogen receptor content. Tamoxifen treatment resulted in decreased cell proliferation and decrease of estrogen receptor content and of total protein synthesis. These results suggest that the estrogen receptor concentration of MCF 7 cells is growth fraction related. Pretreatment with alpha-interferon enhanced the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on cell proliferation while preventing the tamoxifen induced reduction of estrogen receptor content. The synergistic effect of alpha-interferon and tamoxifen are most marked following 72 h pretreatment with interferon, when the maximum interferon induced increase of estrogen receptor concentration is evident. The mechanism is thus due probably to an increase of cellular receptor as a ligand for tamoxifen binding and suggests a possible role for the clinical use of interferons combined with tamoxifen.","['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I', 'Kinetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tamoxifen', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2386944,"[['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['G04.144'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890', 'D23.529.374.440.890'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D12.776.826.750.350', 'D12.776.930.778.350'], ['D12.776.828'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.150.700.900'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5462,Association between red blood cell distribution and renal function in patients with untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"We assessed whether red cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with microalbuminuria (MAU) in a group of 320 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), recruited in Zhengzhou. Patients were divided into normal group and MAU group. Compared with the normal group, the patients with MAU had higher red blood cell count (p = 0.005) and RDW (p < 0.001). The multiple logistic regression indicated that RDW (OR = 3.89, 95% CI: 1.98-7.66, p < 0.001) was an independent risk factor of MAU in newly diagnosed T2DM. Other factors include smoking (OR = 4.44, 95% CI: 2.90-8.72, p < 0.001), higher waist index (OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.89-5.26, p = 0.002), FBG level (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.21-3.84, p = 0.008) and uric acid level (OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.05-4.52, p = 0.037). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves explored the relationship between MAU and RDW. The area under the curve was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74-0.84; p < 0.001). Using a cut-off point of 12.8, the RDW predicted MAU in the T2DM patients with a sensitivity of 71.3% and specificity of 66.9%.

37484,The formate channel FocA exports the products of mixed-acid fermentation.,"Formate is a major metabolite in the anaerobic fermentation of glucose by many enterobacteria. It is translocated across cellular membranes by the pentameric ion channel/transporter FocA that, together with the nitrite channel NirC, forms the formate/nitrite transporter (FNT) family of membrane transport proteins. Here we have carried out an electrophysiological analysis of FocA from Salmonella typhimurium to characterize the channel properties and assess its specificity toward formate and other possible permeating ions. Single-channel currents for formate, hypophosphite and nitrite revealed two mechanistically distinct modes of gating that reflect different types of structural rearrangements in the transport channel of each FocA protomer. Moreover, FocA did not conduct cations or divalent anions, but the chloride anion was identified as further transported species, along with acetate, lactate and pyruvate. Formate, acetate and lactate are major end products of anaerobic mixed-acid fermentation, the pathway where FocA is predominantly required, so that this channel is ideally adapted to act as a multifunctional export protein to prevent their intracellular accumulation. Because of the high degree of conservation in the residues forming the transport channel among FNT family members, the flexibility in conducting multiple molecules is most likely a general feature of these proteins.","['Anions', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Biological Transport', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Fermentation', 'Formates', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Ion Channels', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Salmonella typhimurium']",22847446,"[['D01.248.497.158'], ['D12.776.097'], ['G03.143'], ['G01.358.500.249.277'], ['G02.111.158.249', 'G03.191.249'], ['D02.241.081.420'], ['G02.300'], ['G02.111.820.400', 'G04.835.400', 'G07.265.625'], ['D12.776.157.530.400', 'D12.776.543.550.450', 'D12.776.543.585.400'], ['D10.570.510', 'J01.637.087.500.510'], ['G01.154.535', 'G04.580', 'G07.265.675', 'G11.561.570'], ['B03.440.450.425.800.200.825', 'B03.660.250.150.710.160.760']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
24991,Pattern of recognition of Neospora caninum tachyzoite antigens by naturally infected pregnant cattle and aborted foetuses.,"Different aspects of Neospora tachyzoite antigen recognition by Neospora-infected heifers and cows and aborted foetuses were studied. The pattern of antigen recognition and the relationship between IFAT titres and number of Neospora antigens detected, were evaluated. In addition, the tachyzoite antigens involved in the humoral immune response developed against infection in normal cows and cows that aborted were also characterised throughout pregnancy. Comparison of tachyzoite antigen recognition was carried out in 13 thoracic and/or abdominal fluids from Neospora aborted foetuses and 33 sera from Neospora infected cows that had aborted. The kinetics of Neospora-antigen recognition was studied in Neospora-infected heifers and cows that had aborted foetuses (7) or not (14) during pregnancy. Based on the frequency and intensity of recognition, four IDAs-17-18, 34-35, 37 and 60-62kDa antigens-have been described. Moreover, a correlation was found between Western blot results and IFAT titres in both age groups. In relation to antigen recognition throughout pregnancy by seropositive cows that had aborted or not, the antibody fluctuations throughout pregnancy described in the literature could be due to differences in the intensity and frequency of recognition of particular antigens, especially the 17-18kDa antigen. We emphasize the important role that the 17-18kDa antigen could play in the serological diagnosis of Neospora infection in cattle as this was intensely detected in 100% of the animals.","['Aborted Fetus', 'Abortion, Veterinary', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Protozoan', 'Antigens, Protozoan', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases', 'Coccidiosis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neospora', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic']",12072210,"[['A16.378.099'], ['C13.703.039.422', 'C22.021'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.252', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.252', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.252'], ['D23.050.293'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['C22.196'], ['C01.610.752.250'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512.240.310', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512.240.310', 'E05.200.500.607.512.240.310', 'E05.200.750.551.512.240.310', 'E05.478.583.375.310'], ['N06.850.335.875'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['G02.494'], ['B01.043.075.189.250.750.550'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C01.610.718', 'C13.703.700.680']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The lethalities, anticoagulant effects, hermorrhagic, thrombin-like enzyme, hyaluronidase, protease, arginine ester hydrolase, 5'-nucleotidase, L-amino acid oxidase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase and phospholipase A activities of twenty-three samples of venoms from twelve species of Asian lance-headed pit vipers (genus Trimeresurus) were examined. 2. The results indicate that notwithstanding individual variations in venom properties, the differences in biological properties of the Trimeresurus venoms can be used for the differentiation of venoms from different species of Trimeresurus. 3. The results also suggest that differences in the biological properties of snake venoms are useful parameters in the classification of snake species. 4. Our results indicate that venoms from the species T. okinavensis exhibited biological properties markedly different from other Trimeresurus venoms examined. This observation supports the recently proposed reclassification of T. okinavensis as a member of the genus Ovophis, rather than the genus Trimeresurus.","[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Amino Acid Oxidoreductases', 'Animals', 'Anticoagulants', 'Biological Availability', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Crotalid Venoms', 'Endopeptidases', 'Hemorrhage', 'L-Amino Acid Oxidase', 'Mice', 'Phospholipases A', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases', 'Thrombin']",2553329,"[['D08.811.277.352.650.600.600'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['D08.811.682.664.500'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.502.119'], ['G03.787.151', 'G07.690.725.129'], ['D08.811.277.352.100'], ['D20.888.850.960.200', 'D23.946.833.850.960.200'], ['D08.811.277.656.300'], ['C23.550.414'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.677'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.680.750'], ['D08.811.277.352.640'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.855', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.855', 'D12.776.124.125.890', 'D23.119.960']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
36525,Magnetic Resonance Image Texture Analysis of the Periaqueductal Gray Matter in Episodic Migraine Patients without T2-Visible Lesions.,"Objective: The periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), a small midbrain structure, presents dysfunction in migraine. However, the precise neurological mechanism is still not well understood. Herein, the aim of this study was to investigate the texture characteristics of altered PAG in episodic migraine (EM) patients based on high resolution brain structural magnetic resonance (MR) images.Materials and Methods: The brain structural MR images were obtained from 18 normal controls (NC), 18 EM patients and 16 chronic migraine (CM) patients using a 3T MR system. A PAG template was created using the International Consortium Brain Mapping 152 gray matter model, and the individual PAG segment was developed by applying the deformation field from the structural image segment to the PAG template. A grey level co-occurrence matrix was used to calculate the texture parameters including the angular second moment (ASM), contrast, correlation, inverse difference moment (IDM) and entropy.Results: There was a significant difference for ASM, IDM and entropy in the EM group (998.629 ± 0.162 ? 10-3, 999.311 ± 0.073 ? 10-3, 916.354 ± 0.947 ? 10-5) compared to that found in the NC group (998.760 ± 0.110 ? 10-3, 999.358 ± 0.037 ? 10-3 and 841.198 ± 0.575 ? 10-5) (p < 0.05). The entropy was significantly lower among the patients with CM (864.116 ± 0.571 ? 10-5) than that found among patients with EM (p < 0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.776 and 0.750 for ASM and entropy in the distinction of the EM from NC groups, respectively. ASM was negatively related to disease duration (DD) and the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) scores in the EM group, and entropy was positively related to DD and MIDAS in the EM group (p < 0.05).Conclusion: The present study identified altered MR image texture characteristics of the PAG in EM. The identified texture characteristics could be considered as imaging biomarkers for EM.","['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Area Under Curve', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Migraine Disorders', 'Periaqueductal Gray', 'ROC Curve']",29354004,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['E05.318.740.200', 'G03.787.101', 'G07.690.725.064', 'N06.850.520.830.200'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C10.228.140.546.399.750'], ['A08.186.211.132.659.413.875.595'], ['E05.318.370.800.750', 'E05.318.740.872.750', 'N05.715.360.325.700.680', 'N06.850.520.445.800.750']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Self-reports of satisfaction with life, optimism, and ecological assets in the school (school connectedness), neighborhood (perceived neighborhood support), family (perceived parental support), and peer group (positive peer relationships) were assessed in a sample of 1,402 4th to 7th graders (47% female) from 25 public elementary schools. Multilevel modeling (MLM) was conducted to analyze the variability in life satisfaction both at the individual and the school level. As hypothesized, adding optimism and the dimensions representing the ecology of early adolescence to the model significantly reduced the variability in life satisfaction at both levels of analysis. Both personal (optimism) and all of the ecological assets significantly and positively predicted early adolescents' life satisfaction.

12500,The rhizomes of Alisma orientale and alisol derivatives inhibit allergic response and experimental atopic dermatitis.,"The 70% ethanol extract of the rhizome of Alisma orientale (Alismatis rhizome) (AOE) was prepared and found to significantly inhibit 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)-catalyzed leukotriene (LT) production from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-1 cells and â-hexosaminidase release by antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. It also attenuated delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction in mice. Among the three major triterpene constituents isolated (i.e., alisol B, alisol B 23-acetate, alisol C 23-acetate) as active principles, alisol B and its 23-acetate strongly and significantly inhibited LT production and â-hexosaminidase release between 1-10 µM. On the other hand, all these alisol derivatives significantly and strongly inhibited DTH response after oral administration. In addition, AOE (200 mg/kg/d) was for the first time found to considerably alleviate hapten-induced dermatitis symptoms in NC/Nga mice, an animal model of atopic dermatitis.

All patients were followed-up for at least 60 months or to death. All data were analysed by the computer program NCSS (Number Cruncher Statistical System). According to the results, PCNA-index may be considered an independent prognostic factor for colorectal cancer; it may also be helpful in supporting the therapeutic strategies based only on Dukes' stage.","['Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen', 'Survival Rate']",8572642,"[['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.789'], ['D12.776.660.740', 'D23.050.290.750', 'D23.101.140.600'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
29352,The mutagenic properties of BrdUTP in a random mutagenesis process.,"To explore the mutagenic properties of the nucleotide analogue bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate (BrdUTP), the wild type alpha-amylase (xamy) gene from Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 8004 was used as a mutational target. It was mutated using PCR techniques to partially replace deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) with BrdUTP. A total of 18 mutants were selected for DNA sequencing from the mutagenesis libraries by their ability to hydrolyze the starch. The results showed that 70% of the total mutations were single base-pair substitutions; BrdUTP also induced deletion and insertion mutation types. Among single base-pair substitutions, the predominant mutation type is transition (84%), but three kinds of transversions (16%) were also detected. It thus mainly induces A:T --> G:C and T:A --> C:G transitions. This result indicated that when bromouracil is present as a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate substrate it mainly paired with dAMP, and when it is present as a template base it could pair with free dGTP. Three mutational hot spots induced by BrdUTP were revealed in this work.","['Base Pair Mismatch', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymine Nucleotides', 'Xanthomonas campestris', 'alpha-Amylases']",17874205,"[['G05.365.590.060'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['D03.383.742.686.850.210', 'D13.695.201.200', 'D13.695.740.850.210'], ['G05.558'], ['G05.365.590'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D03.383.742.686.706', 'D13.695.201.789', 'D13.695.740.706'], ['B03.440.400.425.967.930.100', 'B03.660.250.915.930.100'], ['D08.811.277.450.066.050']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Univariate methods, such as the t test or analysis of covariance, cannot evaluate the efficacy of interventions on multiple outcomes simultaneously. The aim of this study was to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to re-analyze a RCT, comparing the effects of pre-curved interdental brushes and flossing on probing pocket depth (PPD), plaque indices, and bleeding on probing (BOP) measured at baseline, intermediate, and final examinations. Results of SEM showed that the observed greater reduction in PPD and BOP in persons using interdental brushing than in those flossing is due mainly to the greater efficiency in plaque removal with the interdental brushes (indirect effect) rather than to the compression of the interdental papillae (direct effect). In contrast, smokers showed less BOP at baseline but also less improvement in BOP through direct effects.","['Chi-Square Distribution', 'Dental Devices, Home Care', 'Dental Plaque', 'Dental Plaque Index', 'Gingivitis', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Models, Statistical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oral Hygiene', 'Periodontal Index', 'Periodontal Pocket', 'Regression Analysis', 'Smoking', 'Toothbrushing', 'Treatment Outcome']",18946011,"[['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['E06.186.250', 'E06.761.726.292', 'E07.222.250'], ['C07.793.208.377'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.300.300', 'E06.208.250', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.300.325', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.300.300', 'N06.890.160.090'], ['C01.408', 'C07.465.714.258.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['E02.547.600', 'E06.761.726'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.300.725', 'E06.208.720', 'E06.721.658', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.300.690', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.300.725', 'N06.890.160.215'], ['C07.465.714.533.750'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['F01.145.805'], ['E06.761.726.794'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
13658,"Rumen microbial diversity in Svalbard reindeer, with particular emphasis on methanogenic archaea.","Ruminal methanogens, bacteria and ciliate protozoa of Svalbard reindeer grazing natural pastures in October (late fall) and April (late winter) were investigated using molecular-based approaches. The appetite of the Svalbard reindeer peaks in August (summer) and is at its lowest in March (winter). Microbial numbers, quantified by real-time PCR, did not change significantly between October and April, when food intakes are at similar levels, although the numbers of methanogens tended to be higher in October (P=0.074), and ciliate numbers tended to be higher in April (P=0.055). Similarly, no change was detected in the bacterial and protozoal population composition by rRNA gene-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. Dominant methanogens were identified using a 16S rRNA gene library (97 clones) prepared from pooled PCR products from reindeer on October pasture (n=5). Eleven of the 22 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) generated exhibited a high degree of sequence similarity to methanogens affiliated with Methanobacteriales (eight OTUs), Methanomicrobiales (one OTU) and Methanosarcinales (two OTUs). The remaining 11 OTUs (53% of the clones) were associated with a cluster of uncultivated ruminal archaea.

9036,Biosynthesis and supramolecular assembly of procollagen IV in neonatal lung.,"The rate of biosynthesis of procollagen IV, the principal collagen of basement membranes, and the concentration of specific RNAs coding for procollagen IV were measured in neonatal rat lungs. Both decreased sharply at birth and then recovered again a few days later. The supramolecular assembly of procollagen IV was followed in neonatal rat, mouse, and chick lungs, which actively elaborate endothelial and alveolar basement membranes, and in chick embryo gizzard which is rich in smooth muscle. The tetramer of four procollagen IV molecules linked covalently through their amino ends was isolated as an assembly intermediate from all these tissues. While noncovalent association of the carboxyl ends of two procollagen IV molecules occurred readily, the subsequent establishment of covalent cross-links was substantially slower in the junctional complexes of the carboxyl ends than of the amino ends. Both disulfide bonds and other, unidentified covalent links formed. The six component carboxyl peptides of a junctional complex became progressively covalently linked into two kinds of carboxyl peptide pairs. We conclude that both amino-linked tetramers and carboxyl-linked dimers of procollagen IV molecules are intermediates in the biological assembly of the collagen networks of these basement membranes.","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Basement Membrane', 'DNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gizzard, Non-avian', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Lung', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Procollagen', 'Rats']",3536952,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['A10.272.220', 'A10.615.179'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G05.308'], ['A13.433'], ['E05.478'], ['A04.411'], ['D05'], ['D12.644.541'], ['D12.776.811.690', 'D12.776.860.300.250.600'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

35638,Pravastatin improves endothelial function in arteries used in coronary bypass grafting.,"Internal mammary artery (IMA) and radial artery (RA) are the 2 main arterial conduits used in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The aim of this study was to analyze in vitro the vasoreactive properties in both vessels and to investigate the effects of pravastatin incubation on vascular function. IMA and RA rings obtained from patients undergoing CABG were studied in organ baths. We examined the contractile responses to phenylephrine and U46619 and the relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside. In another series of experiments, the vascular reactivity and the superoxide anion production were studied after incubation with pravastatin. The effect of mevalonic acid on such responses was also assessed. Our results show that RA significantly evoked greater tension in response to vasoconstrictor agents and higher relaxation to ACh than IMA. In contrast, relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside was not significantly different. Incubation with pravastatin reduced the contractile response to U46619 and improved the endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh in both arteries. Whereas the effect of pravastatin on response to U46619 was completely abolished by coincubation with mevalonic acid, only a partial inhibition on ACh relaxation was observed. In conclusion, in vitro incubation with pravastatin enhanced endothelial function in IMA and RA.

19847,Endoscopic Endonasal Repair of Isolated Medial Orbital Wall Fracture With Balloon Technique.,"Endonasal endoscopic repair of medial orbital wall fractures is minimally invasive and benefits the patients. The authors describe the authors' modified balloon technique, which allows longer support of the orbital wall. From October 2010 through January 2016, the author repaired 9 isolated medial wall fractures by this method. Five patients were diagnosed as having enophthalmos of greater than 2 mm, and 6 patients had persistent diplopia before the operation. The herniated orbital contents that filled the anterior ethmoidal sinus were gently reduced with a 4-mm-diameter 0° sinus endoscope. Then a posterior nasal cavity balloon (Type B # 32014, KOKEN Co, Japan) was inserted into the ethmoidal sinus and filled with normal saline. The inflation tube of the balloon was sutured to the nasal cavity wall with absorbable sutures. After checking the status of the balloon, the inflation tube was ligated and cut so that it could be hidden inside the nasal cavity. The balloon was removed on an outpatient basis 6 to 7 weeks after the surgery. In this series, the mean inflation volume of the balloon was 1.6 mL, the mean period of leaving the balloon in place was 5.7 weeks, and the mean operative time was 38.6 minutes.Resolution of the preoperative diplopia and enophthalmos was achieved in all 9 patients, and there was no recurrence of prolapse of the orbital contents. This method allows leaving the balloon in place for a long period of time without interfering with daily life, which reduces the risk of rebulging of the orbital contents.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Diplopia', 'Enophthalmos', 'Ethmoid Sinus', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasal Cavity', 'Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery', 'Operative Time', 'Orbital Fractures', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",28328613,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C10.597.751.941.339', 'C11.966.339', 'C23.888.592.763.941.339'], ['C11.675.319'], ['A04.531.621.267'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A04.531.449'], ['E01.370.388.250.630', 'E04.502.250.630'], ['E04.614.374.500', 'N02.421.585.753.374.500'], ['C10.900.300.284.500.550', 'C26.404.750.684', 'C26.915.300.425.500.550'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
12647,An áIIb mutation in patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia located in the N-terminus of blade 1 of the â-propeller (Asn2Asp) disrupts a calcium binding site in blade 6.,"BACKGROUND: Studies of Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT)-causing mutations has generated invaluable information on the formation and function of integrin áIIbâ(3).OBJECTIVE: To characterize the mutation in four siblings of an Israeli Arab family affected by GT, and to analyze the relationships between the mutant protein structure and its function using artificial mutations.METHODS AND RESULTS: Sequencing disclosed a new A97G transversion in the áIIb gene predicting Asn2Asp substitution at blade 1 of the â-propeller. Alignment with other integrin á subunits revealed that Asn2 is highly conserved. No surface expression of áIIbâ(3) was found in patients' platelets and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with mutated áIIb and WT â(3). Although the áIIbâ(3) was formed, the mutation impaired its intracellular trafficking. Molecular dynamics simulations and modeling of the áIIbâ(3) crystal indicated that the Asn2Asp mutation disrupts a hydrogen bond between Asn2 and Leu366 of a calcium binding domain in blade 6, thereby impairing calcium binding that is essential for intracellular trafficking of áIIbâ(3). Substitution of Asn2 to uncharged Ala or Gln partially decreased áIIbâ(3) surface expression, while substitution by negatively or positively charged residues completely abolished surface expression. Unlike áIIbâ(3), áVâ(3) harboring the Asn2Asp mutation was surface expressed by transfected BHK cells, which is consistent with the known lower sensitivity of áVâ(3) to calcium chelation compared with áIIbâ(3).CONCLUSION: The new GT causing mutation highlights the importance of calcium binding domains in the â-propeller for intracellular trafficking of áIIbâ(3). The mechanism by which the mutation exerts its deleterious effect was elucidated by molecular dynamics.","['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arabs', 'Asparagine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Platelets', 'Calcium', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutamine', 'Hemostasis', 'Heredity', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Integrin alpha2', 'Integrin beta3', 'Israel', 'Leucine', 'Male', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Thrombasthenia', 'Transfection']",21029361,"[['M01.060.057'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['M01.686.754.167'], ['D12.125.068.060', 'D12.125.095.165', 'D12.125.154.049'], ['D12.125.067.500', 'D12.125.119.170', 'D12.125.427.040'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['A11.118.188', 'A15.145.229.188'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['A11.251.210'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['D12.125.068.330', 'D12.125.095.461', 'D12.125.154.424'], ['G09.188.390'], ['G05.390'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.282'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.408.100.350'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.408.200.750'], ['Z01.252.245.500.375'], ['D12.125.070.637', 'D12.125.142.441'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['E05.393.673'], ['G05.695'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['G03.143.700'], ['C15.378.100.100.820', 'C15.378.140.810', 'C15.378.463.810', 'C16.320.099.820'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

RIF at various concentrations decreased the activities of gamma glutamyl cysteine synthetase (GGCS) and GSH synthetase. Maximum decrease in the activities of biosynthetic enzymes of GSH was observed when 15 micrograms RIF ml-1 medium was incorporated in the growth medium before performing inoculations. The activity of GGCS was also decreased when three day grown M. smegmatis was exposed to 60 micrograms RIF ml-1 medium for a period of 6 h and 9 h.

14805,Visual input induces long-term potentiation of developing retinotectal synapses.,"Early visual experience is essential in the refinement of developing neural connections. In vivo whole-cell recording from the tectum of Xenopus tadpoles showed that repetitive dimming-light stimulation applied to the contralateral eye resulted in persistent enhancement of glutamatergic inputs, but not GABAergic or glycinergic inputs, on tectal neurons. This enhancement can be attributed to potentiation of retinotectal synapses. It required spiking of postsynaptic tectal cells as well as activation of NMDA receptors, and effectively occluded long-term potentiation (LTP) of retinotectal synapses induced by direct electrical stimulation of retinal ganglion cells. Thus, LTP-like synaptic modification can be induced by natural visual inputs and may be part of the underlying mechanism for the activity-dependent refinement of developing connections.","['2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate', '6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione', 'Animals', 'Bicuculline', 'Dicarboxylic Acids', 'Light', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Pyrrolidines', 'Retina', 'Superior Colliculi', 'Synapses', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Xenopus']",10862704,"[['D12.125.070.950.100', 'D12.125.740.025'], ['D03.633.100.857.160'], ['B01.050'], ['D03.132.098.077', 'D03.633.100.531.085.077'], ['D02.241.081.337'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['G11.561.638.350'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D27.505.519.562.437', 'D27.505.519.625.600', 'D27.505.696.577.600'], ['E05.723.729'], ['D03.383.773'], ['A09.371.729'], ['A08.186.211.132.659.800.816'], ['A08.850', 'A11.284.149.165.420.780'], ['A08.612.220.860'], ['F02.463.593.932'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.610.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
19353,Effect of thermocycling on nickel release from orthodontic arch wires: an in vitro study.,"The amount of daily intake of metals from orthodontic appliances over time is a matter of great concern. Nickel results in one of the most common metal-induced allergic contact dermatitis in humans; it produces more allergic reactions than all the other metals combined together. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of thermocycling on the nickel release from orthodontic arch wires stored in artificial saliva with different pH values. Forty new wire pieces were selected. Each wire piece was placed in a special capillary Pyrex tube filled with artificial saliva, which was sealed and immersed in deionized water at 37 °C. The samples were divided into four groups of ten. Group I received no treatment; group II was subjected to thermocycling. The pH of storage in groups III and IV was reduced to 4.5, and group IV was subjected to thermocycling. Thermocycling was carried out between 5 and 55 °C for 500 cycles. The release of nickel ions was statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA for the effects of two variables: pH and thermocycling. The interaction between pH and thermocycling was found to be statistically significant (F = 12.127, P = 0.001). Two-way ANOVA showed that different storage media or pH and thermocycling had a significant effect on the nickel release (F = 52.812, P < 0.001 and F = 197.035, P < 0.001, respectively). Thermocycling and pH can adversely affect the release of nickel from orthodontic wires, while thermocycling is clearly the dominant factor.","['Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Nickel', 'Orthodontic Wires', 'Temperature']",25262019,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.300'], ['D01.268.556.607', 'D01.268.956.625', 'D01.552.544.607'], ['E06.658.453.684'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

11043,Cancellation level and phase of the (f2-f1) distortion product.,"The cancellation level and phase were measured for the (f2-f1) distortion product in six normal-hearing ears as a function of input level (L1,L2) and the frequency separation of the two input signals (f1,f2, where f2 greater than f1). The effects of input level were examined for L1 and L2, varied together (L1 = L2) and separately. Typically, f1 was 1500 Hz while f2/f1 was either 1.16, 1.32, 1.44, or 1.68. For L1 = L2, the median data indicate that the (f2-f1) level grows at a rate of approximately 1.1 dB/dB when averaged across all stimulus conditions. This slope tended to be higher (approximately 1.6 dB/dB) for L1 = L2 greater than 80 dB. Slopes for some subjects also increase as f2/f1 increases. The cancellation phase increases slightly (50 degrees - 100 degrees) with an increase in L1 = L2. With L1 at 75 to 80 dB, L2 ranging from 65 to 95 dB, and f2/f1 = 1.16, (f2-f1) increases monotonically with L2 up to L1 = L2. As L2 increases further (L2 greater than L1), the slopes for the growth of (f2-f1) decrease. For f2/f1 = 1.44, on the other hand, (f2-f1) appears to grow monotonically at a rate of approximately 0.5 dB/dB throughout the range of L2 values. The cancellation phase increases with L2 (approximately 100 degrees) only for the wider frequency separation of the two input signals (f2/f1 = 1.44). There are, however, sizable individual differences in the behavior of the (f2 - f1) distortion product.","['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Adult', 'Audiometry, Pure-Tone', 'Hearing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Biological', 'Sound']",4056218,"[['E02.037', 'E02.190.888.030', 'E05.723.136'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.382.375.060.055'], ['F02.830.816.263', 'G07.888.500', 'G11.561.790.263'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H01.548'], ['E05.599.395'], ['G01.750.770.776']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
45757,Artemisinin sensitizes tumor cells to NK cell-mediated cytolysis.,"The antimalarial drug Artemisinin has been reported to possess direct anti-tumor effects on various types of tumor cells. However, its anti-tumor potential has not been fully revealed, and its effects on tumor susceptibility to immune surveillance by the host are still unknown. Natural killer (NK) cells are the first line in tumor surveillance by the host, and have been recognized as a promising target for tumor immunotherapy. Here, we reported that Artemisinin sensitized tumor cells to NK cell cytolysis. Both human K562 and Raji tumor cells, and mouse YAC-1 tumor cells were more susceptible to human or mouse NK cell cytolysis in vitro after Artemisinin pretreatment. Conjugation formation between tumor cells and NK cells was increased after pretreatment with Artemisinin. Such effects on tumor cells by Artemisinin might not be the results of tumor recognition by NK cells, since major ligands of NK cell surface receptors were not affected. Mechanistically, although Artemisinin didn't induce tumor cell apoptosis, Artemisinin enriched apoptosis-related gene sets in these tumor cells, which might predispose tumor cells to apoptosis upon NK cell cytolysis. Moreover, NK cell numbers, percentages, maturation and functions were preserved in the presence of Artemisinin in vitro, suggesting that Artemisinin displays detrimental effects only on tumor cells but not on immune cells. These data reveal a novel anti-tumor mechanism of Artemisinin and demonstrate that Artemisinin could be a promising drug candidate for cancer treatment.","['Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Artemisinins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms']",32007276,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.250.100.085'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.212', 'D01.339.431.374.212', 'D01.650.550.750.200', 'D02.389.338.055', 'D02.455.849.765.211'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['A11.251'], ['G12.287'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G12.450.050.400.412', 'G12.525'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.537', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.537', 'A15.382.490.555.567.537'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['C04']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
30875,Economic evaluation of donepezil in moderate to severe Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the costs to society of Alzheimer disease (AD) care in a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil in patients with moderate to severe AD.METHODS: A total of 290 patients with AD (screening standardized Mini-Mental State Examination score 5 to 17) were randomized to receive either donepezil (n = 144; 5 mg/day for 28 days, followed by 10 mg/day as per clinician's judgment) or placebo (n = 146) for 24 weeks. The authors collected data on patient and caregiver health resource utilization prospectively using the Canadian Utilization of Services Tracking questionnaire. Costs were calculated for patients and caregivers in each group based on resource utilization multiplied by the unit prices for each resource. A cost (the average Ontario minimum wage for 1998 [Can 6.85 dollars per hour]) was assigned to unpaid time that caregivers spent assisting the patient with activities of daily living (ADL).RESULTS: Patient and caregiver demographics at baseline were similar across the two groups. After adjusting for baseline total cost per patient, the mean total societal cost per patient for the 24-week period was donepezil, Can 9,904 dollars (US 6,686 dollars) and placebo, Can 10,236 dollars (US 6,910 dollars). This net cost saving of Can 332 dollars (US 224 dollars) included the average 24-week cost of donepezil treatment. Most of the cost-saving with donepezil treatment was due to less use of residential care by patients, and caregivers spending less time assisting patients with ADL.CONCLUSION: This cost-consequence analysis reveals economic benefits of treatment of moderate to severe AD with donepezil.","['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Australia', 'Canada', 'Caregivers', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Cost of Illness', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Counseling', 'Donepezil', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'France', 'Health Resources', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Indans', 'Institutionalization', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nootropic Agents', 'Nursing Homes', 'Piperidines', 'Prospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",15326236,"[['E02.760.169.063.500.067', 'E02.831.067', 'I03.050', 'N02.421.784.110'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C10.228.140.380.100', 'C10.574.945.249', 'F03.615.400.100'], ['E02.760.106', 'N02.421.585.106'], ['Z01.639.100', 'Z01.678.100.373'], ['Z01.107.567.176'], ['M01.085', 'M01.526.485.200', 'N02.360.200'], ['D27.505.519.389.275', 'D27.505.519.625.120.300', 'D27.505.696.577.120.300'], ['N03.219.151.165', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.182', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.046'], ['N03.219.151.125'], ['F02.784.176', 'F04.408.413', 'N02.421.143.303', 'N02.421.461.363'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.486.487.280', 'D03.383.621.238', 'D04.615.486.487.280'], ['N03.219.151.400.350', 'N05.300.375.300'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['N03.349.340', 'N05.300.420'], ['N02.421.143.524', 'N02.421.539.089'], ['E02.760.611.470', 'N02.421.143.524.470', 'N02.421.533.320'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.486.487', 'D04.615.486.487'], ['E02.760.415', 'N02.421.585.415'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D27.505.954.427.637'], ['N02.278.825.610'], ['D03.383.621'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
36546,[Urothelial cancer metastases after implantation of tumor cells under the kidney capsule].,"In this study we used the subrenal capsule site of C57BL/6J mice to assess the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of established urothelial cell lines in a syngeneic murine model. High tumor take and subsequent removal of the primary tumor by nephrectomy resulted in the extended lifespan of the animals enabling the formation of secondary tumor growth. To test this model we have used a panel of cell lines expressing constitutively, or following transfection, ras oncogene products. All cell lines constitutively expressing ras oncogenes (K, H, or N-ras) were tumorigenic and metastatic in this assay. One non tumorigenic cell line (BBN3) and one tumorigenic but non-metastatic cell line (SH264), remained non-metastatic following transfection with the pSV2-neo gene but formed micrometastases in the lung when a ras oncogene was introduced in the same manner. Expression of altered ras proteins following transfection in these two cell lines was demonstrated using an H-ras specific antibody in Western blot analysis. This study demonstrates the value of the subrenal capsule site as a metastatic assay for bladder cancer and the potential involvement of ras oncogenes in urothelial cell metastasis.","['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Graft Survival', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Subrenal Capsule Assay', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms']",8376144,"[['B01.050'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.390', 'C04.588.945.947.535.160', 'C12.758.820.750.160', 'C12.777.419.473.160', 'C13.351.937.820.535.160', 'C13.351.968.419.473.160'], ['A11.251.210.172'], ['G12.875.545.340'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['E05.337.550.200.900.830', 'E05.624.850.830'], ['C04.588.945.947.960', 'C12.758.820.968', 'C12.777.829.813', 'C13.351.937.820.945', 'C13.351.968.829.707']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23109,Angiogenic effects of dual gene transfer of bFGF and PDGF-BB after myocardial infarction.,"Therapeutic effects of combination of angiogenic growth factors for the treatment of ischemia after myocardial infarction are largely unknown. Plasmids expressing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) or their combination with a 1:1 mass ratio were injected into hearts with 7-day-old myocardial infarction. Hearts were harvested after 1 and 4 weeks after gene transfer. The major findings in this chronic myocardial infarction model were that bFGF, PDGF-BB and their combination all had a more pronounced angiogenic effect on the arteriolar than the capillary level. bFGF stimulated both capillary and arteriolar growth while PDGF-BB preferentially stimulated arterioles. The combination increased the amount of both capillaries and arterioles and in addition gave rise to stable capillaries compared to single factor transfer but did not further enhance angiogenesis. No cardiovascular side effects were observed after gene transfer.","['Animals', 'Arterioles', 'Capillaries', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Organ Size', 'Plasmids', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",14985120,"[['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114.060', 'A07.015.461.080'], ['A07.015.461.165'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['G07.690.773.968.477'], ['D12.644.276.624.120', 'D12.776.467.624.120', 'D23.529.624.120'], ['E05.393.350'], ['E02.095.301', 'E05.393.420.301'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['G09.330.630'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.660', 'E05.041.124.715', 'G07.100.100.660', 'G07.345.249.690'], ['G05.360.600'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.900', 'D12.776.543.750.630.625', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.630'], ['G09.330.955.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

26063,Lack of Association Between TGF-â1 and MDR1 Genetic Polymorphisms and Cyclosporine-Induced Gingival Overgrowth in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Gingival overgrowth (GO) induced by cyclosporine (CsA), one of the common complications after kidney transplantation, is associated with a genetic component. However, the effect of TGF-â1 and MDR1 gene polymorphisms on the pathogenesis of CsA-induced GO remains to be determined. This study aimed to determine the association between TGF-â1 and MDR1 gene polymorphisms and CsA-induced GO in kidney transplant recipients.METHODS: The Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Chinese CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang databases were comprehensively searched. Data were extracted and pooled results estimated from odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In addition, quality assessment and publication bias of each eligible study were examined.RESULTS: Three trials focusing on the relationship between TGF-â1 +869T>C and +915G>C and 3 studies on MDR1 C3435T gene polymorphisms and the onset of CsA-induced GO were included. No association between the +869T>C polymorphism and CsA-induced GO was found in the dominant model (TT+TC vs CC: OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.29-2.10; P = .614). In the recessive model, no association was found between the +915G>C polymorphism and CsA-induced GO (CC vs GG+GC: OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.81-2.43; P = .225). And in the dominant model, no significance was calculated between MDR1 C3435T gene polymorphisms and CsA-induced GO in kidney transplant recipients (TT vs CC+CT: OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.62-2.09; P = .68).CONCLUSIONS: No significant association exists between TGF-â1 +869T>C, and +915G>C and MDR1 C3435T gene polymorphisms and the pathogenesis of CsA-induced GO in kidney transplant recipients.","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'China', 'Cyclosporine', 'Female', 'Gingival Overgrowth', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Postoperative Period', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1']",28736004,"[['D12.776.157.530.100.075', 'D12.776.157.530.450.074.500.500.250', 'D12.776.395.550.020.400', 'D12.776.543.550.192.400', 'D12.776.543.585.100.200', 'D12.776.543.585.450.074.500.500.250'], ['M01.686.508.200'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['D04.345.566.235.300', 'D12.644.641.235.300'], ['C07.465.714.258.428'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.696.477.656'], ['E02.870.500', 'E04.936.450.485', 'E04.950.774.400'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['G05.365.795'], ['E04.614.750', 'N02.421.585.753.750'], ['D12.644.276.374.687.100', 'D12.644.276.954.775.100', 'D12.776.467.374.687.100', 'D12.776.467.942.775.100', 'D23.529.374.687.100', 'D23.529.942.775.100']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
24356,A 130 year record of pollution in the Suances estuary (southern Bay of Biscay): implications for environmental management.,"Geochemical composition (Al, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni, Cr and As) and foraminiferal assemblages in surface and core sediments were determined to assess the current situation and the recent environmental transformation of the Suances estuary (southern Bay of Biscay, Spain). Dating of the historical record has been achieved using isotopic analysis ((210)Pb, (137)Cs) and two benchmark events such as the beginning of the mineral exploitation in the Reoc?n Pb-Zn deposits and the evolution of the chlor-alkali industry (inputs of Hg). Concentrations of Zn, Pb and Cd in both surface and core samples are remarkably higher than background values, reflecting the existence of significant amounts of polluted materials. The dramatic environmental impact of this pollution is clearly recorded by the change of the foraminiferal assemblages that even reach an afaunal stage during recent decades. Application of two different sets of Sediment Quality Guidelines confirm that they exert potential risk to the environment, and therefore if dredged they should need specific management measures. The results provide a reference database to monitor future environmental changes in the Suances estuary, particularly as regards the contaminated sediment storage and the re-colonization by autochtonous meiofauna.","['Animals', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Invertebrates', 'Oceans and Seas', 'Rivers', 'Spain', 'Time Factors', 'Water Pollutants', 'Water Pollution']",18760425,"[['B01.050'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['G01.311.330', 'G16.500.320'], ['B01.050.500'], ['G01.311.625', 'G16.500.275.725.500.650', 'Z01.756'], ['G01.311.750', 'G16.500.275.280.650', 'N06.230.232.650'], ['Z01.542.846'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D27.888.284.903'], ['N06.850.460.790']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
28771,A Disease-associated Mutant of NLRC4 Shows Enhanced Interaction with SUG1 Leading to Constitutive FADD-dependent Caspase-8 Activation and Cell Death.,"Nod-like receptor family card containing 4 (NLRC4)/Ipaf is involved in recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns leading to caspase-1 activation and cytokine release, which mediate protective innate immune response. Point mutations in NLRC4 cause autoinflammatory syndromes. Although all the mutations result in constitutive caspase-1 activation, their phenotypic presentations are different, implying that these mutations cause different alterations in properties of NLRC4. NLRC4 interacts with SUG1 and induces caspase-8-mediated cell death. Here, we show that one of the autoinflammatory syndrome-causing mutants of NLRC4, H443P, but not T337A and V341A, constitutively activates caspase-8 and induces apoptotic cell death in human lung epithelial cells. Compared with wild type NLRC4, the H443P mutant shows stronger interaction with SUG1 and with ubiquitinated cellular proteins. Phosphorylation of NLRC4 at Ser533 plays a crucial role in caspase-8 activation and cell death. However, H443P mutant does not require Ser533 phosphorylation for caspase-8 activation and cell death. Caspase-8 activation by NLRC4 and its H443P mutant are dependent on the adaptor protein FADD. A phosphomimicking mutant of NLRC4, S533D does not require SUG1 activity for inducing cell death. Ubiquitin-tagged NLRC4 could induce cell death and activate caspase-8 independent of Ser533 phosphorylation. Our work suggests that SUG1-mediated signaling results in enhanced ubiquitination and regulates FADD-dependent caspase-8 activation by NLRC4. We show that the autoinflammation-associated H443P mutant is altered in interaction with SUG1 and ubiquitinated proteins, triggering constitutive caspase-8-mediated cell death dependent on FADD but independent of Ser533 phosphorylation.","['A549 Cells', 'ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Caspase 8', 'Cell Death', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Hereditary Autoinflammatory Diseases', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors', 'Ubiquitination']",27974463,"[['A11.251.210.190.080', 'A11.251.860.180.080', 'A11.436.054'], ['D08.811.277.040.013.500', 'D08.811.277.040.025.024', 'D12.776.157.025.750'], ['D12.644.360.024', 'D12.776.157.057', 'D12.776.476.024'], ['E05.393.420.601.035', 'G05.558.109'], ['D12.644.360.024.131', 'D12.644.360.075.358', 'D12.776.157.057.006', 'D12.776.476.024.139', 'D12.776.476.075.358'], ['D12.776.157.125'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126.550.800', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126.550.800', 'D12.644.360.024.285.037', 'D12.644.360.075.405.550.800', 'D12.644.360.075.421.037', 'D12.776.157.057.018.037', 'D12.776.476.024.320.025', 'D12.776.476.075.405.550.800', 'D12.776.476.075.421.037'], ['G04.146'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D12.644.360.024.285.200', 'D12.644.360.024.500.124', 'D12.644.360.075.421.200', 'D12.776.157.057.018.200', 'D12.776.157.057.500.124', 'D12.776.476.024.320.550', 'D12.776.476.024.500.124', 'D12.776.476.075.421.200'], ['C16.320.382', 'C17.800.827.368'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.512'], ['G05.365.590.650'], ['D05.500.562.500', 'D08.811.277.656.918', 'D08.811.600.730'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.776.930'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600.925', 'G02.111.691.600.775', 'G03.734.871.790.600.831', 'G05.308.670.600.831']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
47589,Controlled steroid delivery via bioabsorbable stent: safety and performance in a rabbit model.,"BACKGROUND: Middle turbinate lateralization, adhesions, and inflammation are causes of suboptimal sinus patency following surgery. A bioabsorbable drug-eluting stent has been developed to maintain sinus patency while providing controlled steroid delivery to the sinus mucosa. The aim of this study was to characterize the in vivo drug delivery efficacy and tolerance of this stent in a rabbit model.METHODS: Bioabsorbable stents coated with mometasone furoate were placed bilaterally in the maxillary sinuses of 31 rabbits via dorsal maxillary sinusotomy. Animals were sacrificed between 5 days and 18 weeks postoperatively. Efficacy was assessed by measuring tissue concentrations of steroid in maxillary sinus and nasal mucosa and by measurement of plasma steroid concentrations. Tolerance was assessed by histological evaluation of the sinus mucosa at different time points.RESULTS: Therapeutic mucosal drug concentrations were attained in a time-dependent fashion (range 175-28,189 ng/g). Plasma drug concentrations were generally near or below the lower limit of quantification (15 pg/mL). Histopathological examination of the mucosa showed no differences in the reaction to steroid-coated stents versus nondrug-coated control stents, with inflammation, epithelial ulceration, and bony reaction ranging from none to mild at all time points. Microscopic fungal hyphae were noted in a small proportion of both treatment and control sinuses, without evidence of associated adverse tissue reaction.CONCLUSIONS: In a rabbit model, mometasone-coated bioabsorbable stents are able to provide local steroid delivery with negligible systemic absorption. Corticosteroid-eluting stents may prove useful following endoscopic sinus surgery in maintaining sinus patency and reducing inflammation.","['Absorbable Implants', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug-Eluting Stents', 'Endoscopy', 'Infusion Pumps, Implantable', 'Models, Animal', 'Mometasone Furoate', 'Mycoses', 'Nasal Mucosa', 'Paranasal Sinuses', 'Pregnadienediols', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections', 'Rabbits', 'Tissue Extracts']",19958608,"[['E07.695.025'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.158'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['E07.695.750.500'], ['E01.370.388.250', 'E04.502.250'], ['E07.505.254', 'E07.858.082.505.254'], ['E05.598'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.719.526'], ['C01.150.703'], ['A04.531.520', 'A04.760.600', 'A10.615.550.760.600'], ['A04.531.621'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.719'], ['C01.685', 'C23.550.767.868'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['D20.777']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7478,"HLA alleles, especially amino-acid signatures of HLA-DPB1, might contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of early-onset autoimmune thyroid disease.","The major histocompatibility complex region has been suggested to play an important role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). In this study, we investigated the associations of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and amino acid variants of HLA with early-onset AITD. HLA class I and class II genes were analyzed in 116 Korean children with AITDs (Graves' disease [GD]: 71, Hashimoto's disease [HD]: 45) and 142 healthy controls. HLA-B*46:01 (OR = 3.96, Pc = 0.008), -C*01:02 (OR = 2.51 Pc = 0.04), -DPB1*02:02 (OR = 3.99, Pc = 0.04), and -DPB1*05:01 (OR = 4.6, Pc = 0.003) were significantly associated with GD, and HLA-A*02:07 (OR = 4.68, Pc = 0.045) and -DPB1*02:02 (OR = 6.57, Pc = 0.0001) with HD. The frequency of HLA-DPB1*05:01 was significantly higher in GD patients than in HD patients (Pc = 0.0005). Furthermore, differences were found between patients with Thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) and those without TAO in the distribution of HLA-B*54:01 (8.6% vs. 30.6%, P = 0.04) and -C*03:03 (37.1% vs. 11.1%, P = 0.02). In the analysis of amino acid variants of HLA molecules, both Leu35 (OR = 23.38, P = 0.0002) and Glu55 (OR = 23.38, P = 0.0002) of HLA-DPB1 were strongly associated with GD and showed different distributions between GD and HD (P = 0.001).

49661,Surveillance of surgical site infections by surgeons: biased underreporting or useful epidemiological data?,"Surgical site infections (SSIs) significantly increase post-operative morbidity and mortality. SSI surveillance is an established monitoring tool and reduces SSI rates. The purpose of this study was to compare prospective in-hospital SSI surveillance (I) by the surgical staff and (II) additionally by an infection control team (ICT). The reference method (III) was defined by data generated by the surgical team, supplemented by the ICT and completed by post-discharge surveillance with a post-operative follow-up of one year representing the sum of all available resources. During 24 months, all consecutive inpatient procedures (N=6283) were prospectively recorded by the surgical staff until patients' discharge (I). SSI rates were compared with the surveillance performed by the ICT (II) and with the reference method (III). The overall SSI rate (reference method) was 4.7% (N=293), of which 187 (63.8%) were detected in-hospital and 106 (36.2%) after discharge. (I) The surgical staff detected 91/187 (48.7%) of in-hospital SSIs [91/293 (31.0%) of the reference], (II) the ICT an additional 96/187 (51.3%) during hospitalisation [96/293 (32.8%) of the reference]. Further cross-checking as performed in the visceral surgery department increased the surgeons' detection rate (I) to 59/105 (56.2%) of in-hospital SSIs [59/147 (40.1%) of the reference]. SSI surveillance by the surgical staff detects almost half of all in-hospital SSIs and has the potential to increase the detection rate by simple interventions such as cross-checking. Such a relatively inexpensive surveillance system is an option for hospitals without an ICT or for low risk surgical procedures. Moreover, trends in SSI rates can easily be detected, allowing early intervention.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross Infection', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Physicians', 'Surgical Wound Infection']",20227139,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C01.248', 'C23.550.291.875.500'], ['E05.318.308', 'L01.399.250', 'N05.715.360.300', 'N06.850.520.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N06.850.780.200.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['M01.526.485.810', 'N02.360.810'], ['C01.947.692', 'C23.550.767.925']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Its prevalence is estimated between 2 to 6% of the adult population and 16% for those over 65. Due to the personal, economic and sanitary repercussions which it generates and to its own associated degenerative complications, this disease is responsible for a high percentage of deaths. This sickness can not be cured, but it can be controlled and its degenerative complications reduced over the long-term. In recent years, the medical profession has paid special attention to the adherence to treatment plans to control diabetes, bearing in mind which factors interfere in treatment and which are favorable to treatment.

To accomplish this, the rate of retakes in an endodontic clinic at a dental school was measured. Then the effect that two factors, anatomic location and type of film holder, had on this rate were calculated and analyzed. Criteria for acceptability were that radiographs have adequate coverage and minimal distortion. Two endodontists evaluated endodontic treatment radiographs taken by undergraduate dental students to determine if these criteria were met. Of 402 films evaluated 77% were considered to be acceptable. A significantly higher rate of acceptability occurred with films taken in the mandible compared with those taken in the maxilla. The EndoRay (Rinn Corp., Elgin, Ill.) and hemostat were the only types of film holders compared. Films taken with the EndoRay in the maxilla had a significantly higher acceptability rate than those taken in the maxilla with a hemostat.

19752,Enhancing Parenting Quality for Young Children Adopted Internationally: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Children adopted internationally are often dysregulated biologically and behaviorally due to prior experiences of institutional care or caregiving changes and thus are in need of enhanced parental care. The present study assessed whether parents randomized to receive Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) demonstrated significant improvements in parenting quality when compared to parents receiving a control intervention. Participants were 120 internationally adopted children and their adoptive parents. Sixty-three (52.5%) of the children and 113 (94.2%) of the primary caregivers were female. Children were adopted from several countries and predominantly from China, Russia, South Korea, and Ethiopia. The majority of parents identified themselves as White/non-Hispanic (95.0%). At the start of intervention, parents ranged in age from 26.2 to 51.1 years old (M= 39.7, SD = 6.0), and children ranged in age from 6.8 months to 48.4 months (M = 21.9, SD = 9.0). Sensitivity (i.e., contingent responsiveness to a child's cues), intrusiveness (i.e., physical and/or verbal behavior that interferes with a child's autonomy), and positive regard (i.e., positive affect expressed towards a child) were assessed at preintervention, immediately postintervention, and at annual follow-up visits. Parents who received ABC showed better parenting quality at postintervention than parents who received a control intervention, and these effects persisted at a 2-year follow-up.

28522,Mutations in clotting factors and inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have a three- to fourfold greater risk of venous thrombosis compared with the general population. We aimed to determine if patients with CD and UC had a greater likelihood of mutations in genes that increase clotting risk, in a population-based case-control study.METHODS: Subjects were drawn from the University of Manitoba IBD Research Registry and controls were drawn from Manitoba Health's administrative database. Cases (CD, N = 327; UC, N = 165) and controls (N = 412) underwent venipuncture. DNA was purified from whole blood. Genotypes for wild-type and common mutations that have been associated with venous thrombosis for each of Factor II (prothrombin) (G20210A), Factor V (G1691A:'Leiden'), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, C677T), and Factor XIII (val34leu) were assessed.RESULTS: A total of 1.5% and 6.1% were heterozygous for Factor II and Factor V variants, respectively, without differences among cases and controls. Only one subject was homozygous for Factor V Leiden (and none were homozygous for Factor II mutation). Although some differences were observed among cases and controls in the prevalence of MTHFR C677T (decrease in mutant allele carriership in UC) and FXIII val34leu (increase in double mutant allele carriership in CD), these did not explain an excess risk of thrombosis. Age, sex, or disease phenotypes were not associated with prothrombotic genotypes.CONCLUSIONS: While there was a slightly greater prevalence of Factor XIII mutation carriership in CD, we did not find that gene mutations for these four common factors could explain the greater risk of venous thrombosis in CD and UC.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Blood Coagulation', 'DNA', 'Factor V', 'Factor XIII', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Male', 'Manitoba', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Prothrombin', 'Retrospective Studies']",17156138,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['G09.188.390.150'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D12.776.124.125.300', 'D12.776.811.272', 'D23.119.300'], ['D08.622.505', 'D12.776.124.125.475', 'D12.776.811.243.505', 'D23.119.475'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.405.205.731', 'C06.405.469.432'], ['Z01.107.567.176.410'], ['D08.811.682.662.290', 'D12.776.331.775'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G05.365.590'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E01.789'], ['D08.622.709', 'D12.776.124.125.800', 'D12.776.811.243.709', 'D23.119.945'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
44763,Investigation of an outbreak of Salmonella typhi in a public school in Madrid.,"A typhoid fever outbreak affecting 54 school students occurred in a Public School of M?stoles, Madrid. The date of onset was 11 June 1991 and the last detected case was 8 July 1991. Salmonella typhi was cultured from blood and/or stool samples corresponding to 54 patients and one food-handler. There were no secondary cases detected. Epidemiological investigation suggested a salad or a custard as the common source. Patients and the food-handler were treated with ampicillin/amoxicillin for up to three weeks. There were seven relapses that were also treated with the same antibiotics with success. None were found to be excreting the organisms when tested after four months. All the Salmonella typhi isolated strains were phagetype 34, biotype Xylose +, Tetrationate Reductase + and harboured a similar 22 Mdal plasmid, they were also susceptible to the antibiotics tested.","['Adolescent', 'Amoxicillin', 'Ampicillin', 'Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Carrier State', 'Child', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Oxidoreductases', 'Plasmids', 'Population Surveillance', 'Recurrence', 'Salmonella typhi', 'Schools', 'Spain', 'Students', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Urban Population', 'Xylose']",8405309,"[['M01.060.057'], ['D02.065.589.099.750.750.050.050', 'D02.886.108.750.750.050.050', 'D03.633.100.300.750.750.050.050'], ['D02.065.589.099.750.750.050', 'D02.886.108.750.750.050', 'D03.633.100.300.750.750.050'], ['E01.370.225.875.150.125', 'E05.200.875.150.125'], ['N06.850.520.169'], ['M01.060.406'], ['N06.850.290'], ['A12.459'], ['J01.576.423.200'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.332', 'J01.576.423.850.730.500.249.300', 'N06.850.425.200', 'N06.850.460.400.300', 'N06.850.601.500.249.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['D08.811.682'], ['G05.360.600'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['B03.440.450.425.800.200.800', 'B03.660.250.150.710.160.750'], ['I02.783', 'J03.832'], ['Z01.542.846'], ['M01.848'], ['C01.150.252.400.310.821.873'], ['N01.600.900'], ['D09.947.875.627.867']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
26184,Selective inhibition of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 gene expression in human embryonal kidney cells by specific triple helix-forming oligonucleotides.,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a chemokine that is expressed by a variety of tissue cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. A major function of MCP-1 is the recruitment and activation of monocytes and T lymphocytes. Overexpression of MCP-1 has been implicated in a number of diseases, including glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid arthritis, indicating that the modulation of MCP-1 activity and/or expression is a desired therapeutic strategy. In the present study, our aim was to test whether the MCP-1 expression could be inhibited at the transcriptional level using triple helix-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs). We designed a TFO targeted to the SP-1 binding site in the human MCP-1 gene promoter. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the phosphodiester TFO formed a sequence-specific triplex with its dsDNA target with an EC50 of approximately 1.9 x 10(-7) M. The corresponding phosphorothioated oligonucleotide was also effective in this assay with an 8-fold higher EC50 value. Binding of the TFO to the target DNA prevented the binding of rSP-1 and of nuclear proteins in vitro. The TFO could also partially inhibit endogenous MCP-1 gene expression in cultured human embryonic kidney cells. Treatment of TNF-alpha-stimulated human embryonic kidney 293 cells with the TFO inhibited the secretion of MCP-1 in a dose-dependent manner (up to 45% at 5 microM oligonucleotide). The inhibition of MCP secretion was caused at the level of gene transcription, because MCP-1 mRNA levels in oligonucleotide-treated cells were also decreased by approximately 40%.","['Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor']",10657660,"[['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.110.990.600', 'D12.776.467.374.200.110.990.600', 'D23.125.300.110.990.600', 'D23.469.200.110.990.600', 'D23.529.374.200.110.990.500'], ['G05.308'], ['E05.393.335'], ['G05.360.337'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A05.810.453'], ['G02.111.570.820.486', 'G05.360.580'], ['D13.695.578.424'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D12.776.260.522.750.249', 'D12.776.930.375.750.249']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8723,Serum Pentraxin 3 level as a recent biomarker of diabetic retinopathy in Egyptian patients with diabetes.,"INTRODUCTION: Serum Pentraxin3 Level As A recent Biomarker Of Diabetic Retinopathy In Egyptian patients with diabetes.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between elevated levels of plasma pentraxin 3 and the development and/or progression of diabetic retinopathy.SUBJECTS: and methods: This case control study was carried out in internal medicine department, outpatient clinic of internal medicine and outpatient clinic of ophthalmology, at Zagazig university Hospital, 2018. Serum PTX3 level, HsCRP, HbA1c, lipid profile, serum creatinine were determined in 20 normal subjects, 20 patients with prediabetes, 20 patients with diabetes without diabetic retinopathy (DR), 20 patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and 20 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).RESULTS: Serum PTX3 level significantly increased in patients with DR more than patients without DR with cut off point 1150 pg/ml, sensitivity 93.3%and specificity 72%. Serum HsCRP level significantly increased in patients with DR more than patients without DR with cut off point of 7.60 pg/ml has sensitivity 93.3% and specificity 68%.. Combined use of PTX3 and HsCRP decreases sensitivity to 76.7%, but combined use increases specificity to 90%.Significant relation between poor glycemic control and development of DR and its severity as showed by HbA1c.CONCLUSION: Serum PTX3 levels mayt have significant role in the development of DR and its severity. Serum HsCRP increased with DR progression. Poor glycemic control significantly associated with high incidence of diabetic retinopathy and its severity.

36832,New insights into acute annular outer retinopathy.,"PURPOSE: Acute annular outer retinopathy is a rare entity. There are only a few cases in the world's literature. Our study is the first to describe the spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings in the acute presentation of this disease and to follow the disease in convalescence.METHODS: This article is a descriptive case report. We used Spectralis OCT to image the transient intraretinal whitening that is initially seen in this disorder, and the OCT changes during follow-up.RESULTS: Our article provides additional information about the natural history of this uncommon disease, and its varied presentation and prognosis. We were able to document the initial white line seen in the acute phase of the disease and correlate it anatomically by using OCT. We found hyperreflectivity in the outer nuclear layer and the Henle fiber layer along with marked atrophy of the outer retina within the white ring. We documented restoration of foveal photoreceptors, which corresponded with visual recovery. We also noted progressive atrophy in areas where the white ring was previously visible.CONCLUSION: We describe a single case of acute annular outer retinopathy with the corresponding spectral domain OCT findings during the acute phase of the disease and during subsequent follow-up demonstrating progressive atrophy of the outer retina. This may shed insight into possible causation for this rare disease.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Humans', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, Optical Coherence']",25383859,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.370.050.350', 'E01.370.380.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C11.768'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.370.350.589.249.500', 'E01.370.350.825.805.500', 'E05.642.249.500']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
16970,Foreign body in the airway: unusual cause of acute dyspnoe after cardiac surgery.,"We report on a 68-year-old male who presented with acute onset of dyspnoea and cough. After coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve repair with an annuloplasty ring, postoperative recovery was initially uneventful. On the 6th postoperative day, he came back to intensive care unit due to acute dyspnoea. Fig. 1 demonstrates chest x-ray. We identified the foreign body as a dental prosthesis (Fig. 2). Removal from the right bronchial tree was successful using a flexible bronchoscope under local anesthesia; intubation was not required. This procedure was safe and well tolerated by the patient. Clinical presentation of adult foreign body aspiration are often nonspecific. Chest x-ray is very helpful for identification and localization of foreign bodies in the airway. Extraction can be performed with flexible or rigid bronchoscopy. For the removal, biopsy forceps, Fogarty balloon catheter, alligator forceps or wire baskets are effective.","['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Dental Prosthesis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dyspnea', 'Foreign-Body Migration', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Radiography']",15940436,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E04.100.376.719.332', 'E04.100.814.868.750', 'E04.928.220.520.220'], ['E06.780.346', 'E07.695.190'], ['E01.171'], ['C08.618.326', 'C23.888.852.371'], ['C26.392.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.700']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The compound, which is monohaptenic conjugate with the DNCP group as haptenic part and the carbohydrate moiety as auxiliary group, was found to be unable to precipitate high-titered anti-DNCP antisera. This precludes formation of simple, functionally oligovalent associates. Since many monohaptenic anaphylactogens with various hydrocarbon chains as auxiliary groups do not induce anaphylaxis when given intradermally, the anaphylaxis, demonstrated after intradermal antigen application, allows a biological distinction between the lactobionoyl and similar conjugates, and the hydrocarbon-bearing anaphylactogens.","['Animals', 'Disaccharides', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Haptens', 'Immunochemistry', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis']",4077350,"[['B01.050'], ['D09.698.629.305', 'D09.947.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['D23.050.550.480'], ['H01.158.201.486', 'H01.181.122.605', 'H02.403.044.500'], ['E01.370.225.812.871.600', 'E05.200.812.871.600', 'E05.478.594.890.600', 'G12.122.754']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
29250,[The pro-fibrotic and pro-oxidant action of isoniazid].,"As a result of experimental research on rats with destructive pulmonary tuberculosis, oxidative action of isoniazid in a dose of 50 mg per kg body weight, corresponding to the mean therapeutic dose of 10 mg/kg in man, was clearly defined. Fibrotic action of the drug was also shown. It manifested itself by a sharp rise of insoluble collagen levels in the lung tissue tuberculous lesion focus of the treated animals and in the formation of mature connective tissue.

40313,Decisional capacity of depressed elderly to consent to electroconvulsive therapy.,"The purpose of this article is to determine the abilities of severely depressed elderly to consent to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and to investigate the impact of educational intervention on their capacity. Forty severely depressed adults referred for ECT, with Mini-Mental State Examination scores greater than 20, were recruited. Using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T), decisional capacities were assessed at baseline and reassessed after education. Between the 2 assessments, all subjects received standard education, and half of the group was subsequently randomized to receive further education. At baseline, the geriatric group scored lower on understanding, reasoning, and choice and higher on appreciation. After education, all MacCAT-T scores increased for both age groups. Depressed elderly in the sample, as a group, had adequate decisional capacities to consent to ECT. They showed greater improvement in decisional capacity with education. The findings highlight the importance of providing education to the elderly to optimize their ability to give informed consent.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Decision Making', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Male', 'Mental Competency', 'Mental Status Schedule', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Patient Participation', 'Psychiatric Department, Hospital', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Treatment Outcome']",15018698,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['F03.084.500'], ['F02.463.785.373'], ['F03.600.300.375'], ['F04.570.200.583', 'F04.669.224.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.880.604.473.650.718', 'I01.880.604.583.427', 'N03.706.437.650.312', 'N03.706.535.489'], ['F01.590', 'F02.410', 'I01.880.604.583.530', 'N03.706.535.625'], ['F04.711.513.603.500', 'F04.711.513.653.574'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I02.233.332.500', 'N02.421.726.407.680'], ['F01.100.150.750.500.620', 'F01.145.488.887.500.620', 'N02.421.143.212.300', 'N03.540.245.360.300', 'N05.300.150.800.500.620'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.641', 'N04.452.442.452.422.641'], ['N02.278.808'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
34480,Flow-induced protein kinase A-CREB pathway acts via BMP signaling to promote HSC emergence.,"Fluid shear stress promotes the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) of the developing mouse embryo. We determined that the AGM is enriched for expression of targets of protein kinase A (PKA)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a pathway activated by fluid shear stress. By analyzing CREB genomic occupancy from chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, we identified the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway as a potential regulator of CREB. By chemical modulation of the PKA-CREB and BMP pathways in isolated AGM VE-cadherin(+) cells from mid-gestation embryos, we demonstrate that PKA-CREB regulates hematopoietic engraftment and clonogenicity of hematopoietic progenitors, and is dependent on secreted BMP ligands through the type I BMP receptor. Finally, we observed blunting of this signaling axis using Ncx1-null embryos, which lack a heartbeat and intravascular flow. Collectively, we have identified a novel PKA-CREB-BMP signaling pathway downstream of shear stress that regulates HSC emergence in the AGM via the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Mesonephros', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium-Calcium Exchanger']",25870201,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.644.276.954.200', 'D12.776.467.942.200', 'D23.529.942.200'], ['D12.776.260.108.184', 'D12.776.930.127.184'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.150.125', 'D12.644.360.200.125', 'D12.776.476.200.125'], ['A16.254'], ['A11.436.275'], ['A11.148.378', 'A11.872.378', 'A15.378.316.378'], ['A16.599'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.776.157.530.450.162.442', 'D12.776.543.585.450.162.442']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
42665,Soluble form of LR11 is highly increased in the vitreous fluids of patients with idiopathic epiretinal membrane.,"PURPOSE: LR11 (also called SorLA or SORL1) is a migration regulator of adherent cells with the immature proliferative phenotype. The present study investigated the clinical and pathological involvement of the soluble form of LR11 (sLR11) in the idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iERM).METHODS: The subjects were 51 patients with iERM (24 cellophane macular reflex (CMR) and 27 preretinal macular fibrosis (PMF)) and 45 patients with macular holes as age and sex-matched controls. Vitreous sLR11 and transforming growth factor (TGF)â2 levels were measured by ELISA.RESULTS: The sLR11 levels in the vitreous fluids of patients with iERM (20.2 ± 8.1 ng/mL) were significantly higher than those in controls (11.4 ± 4.7 ng/mL). Among the patients with iERM, the vitreous sLR11 levels were significantly higher in PMF (23.6 ± 8.2 ng/mL), than those in CMR (16.5 ± 5.9 ng/mL). Multivariate regression analysis of the studied factors showed that sLR11 was a unique factor independently contributing to the discrimination of the iERM patients against the control subjects (odds ratio [OR] 1.35 per 1-ng/mL increase, 95% CI 1.09-1.67; P = 0.004). ROC analysis showed that the sensitivity and the specificity of sLR11, but not of other studied factors, categorized into the rank of moderate accuracy. Finally, there was a positive correlation (R = 0.588; P = 0.003) between the vitreous levels of sLR11 and TGFâ2 using the available samples.CONCLUSIONS: sLR11 levels in vitreous fluids were specifically increased in patients with iERM, suggesting the involvement in the pathology of proliferative and migrating cells for the development of iERM.","['Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Movement', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epiretinal Membrane', 'Female', 'Humans', 'LDL-Receptor Related Proteins', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta2', 'Vitreous Body']",28102455,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D23.101'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['C11.768.328'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.526', 'D12.776.543.750.710.450.500'], ['D12.776.157.530', 'D12.776.543.585'], ['D12.776.631'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['D12.644.276.374.687.200', 'D12.644.276.954.775.200', 'D12.776.467.374.687.200', 'D12.776.467.942.775.200', 'D23.529.374.687.200', 'D23.529.942.775.200'], ['A09.371.714.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
34951,Parental expectancies and childhood anxiety disorders: psychometric properties of the Parental Expectancies Scale.,"The current study examined the psychometric properties of the Parental Expectancies Scale (PES) in childhood anxiety disorder and normative samples. The PES is a 20-item self-report instrument that assesses five dimensions of parental expectancies in academic, extra-curricular, household, social, and general success areas. Results indicated that the PES has high test-retest reliability and internal consistency. Regarding validity, PES subscale scores discriminated clinical and normative groups. Principal component and confirmatory factor analyses supported the construct validity of the scale. The PES appears to be a reliable and valid instrument for quantifying parental expectancies.

24555,Methotrexate preferentially affects Tc1 and Tc17 subset of CD8 T lymphocytes.,"Rheumatoid arthritis is considered a T-lymphocyte-mediated disease. However, studies have focussed on CD4 T-lymphocytes, ignoring CD8 T-lymphocytes despite the latter being found abundantly in the synovium. Specifically, there is little data of the effect of methotrexate, the gold-standard DMARD, on various CD8 cytokine T-lymphocyte subsets and conflicting data on CD4 subsets. In this prospective study, patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, who were 18 to 65 years of age, were treated with methotrexate (up to 25 mg per week) for 24 weeks. At baseline and 24 weeks, frequencies of CD8+IFNã+, CD8+IL17+, CD8+IL4+, corresponding CD4 subsets and plasma levels of IFNã, IL-12, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-17 were determined by flow cytometry. These are summarised as median (IQR = interquartile range, 25th-75th percentile) and paired data compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. This study included 67 patients (F/M = 4:1) with rheumatoid arthritis, 57 (85%) being RF positive and 20 receiving prednisolone at baseline. Mean (± SD) dose of methotrexate at 24 weeks was 22.9 ± 3.0 mg per week. On treatment with methotrexate, there was a significant (p = 0.04) decline in CD8+IFNã+ cells from 37.2 (IQR 19.4-60.2) to 22.7% (IQR 8.5-49.7) and a marginal increase in CD8+IL17+ cells from 0.3 (IQR 0.1-0.6) to 0.4 (IQR 0.2-1.2), p = 0.006. There was no significant change in the other subsets. There was also a significant decline in circulating levels of IL-12, IL-10 and IL-17 and marginal increase in IL-4. On evaluating by response, non-responders but not responders had a significant increase in CD8+IL17+ (p = 0.01). There is a significant decline of CD8+IFNã+ T cells and marginal increase in CD8+IL17+ T cells after methotrexate.

5627,Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of batifiban coadministered with antithrombin agents in Chinese healthy volunteers.,"The combined use of batifiban, a synthetic platelet GPII b/ IIIa receptor antagonist, and antithrombin agents is an attractive option for the treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and those scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention. To observe whether antithrombin agents affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of batifiban in combination therapy and optimize clinical administration dosage of batifiban, an open-label and parallel study was conducted. Thirty healthy subjects were randomly divided into three groups, which were sequentially treated with batifiban alone, or oral coadministration of clopidogrel, aspirin and UFH, or batifiban coadministered with these antithrombin agents. Blood samples were collected at pre-specified time points. The evaluation index included the inhibition of platelet aggregation and pharmacokinetic parameters. The pharmacokinetic parameters of batifiban and batifiban coadministered with antithrombin agents showed no significant differences. The mean inhibition rate of platelet aggregation (%) suggested that neither batifiban alone nor antithrombin agents alone could provide such potent inhibition rate (>80%) to obtain the best clinical efficacy, but they had a synergistic effect on platelet inhibition. No serious adverse effects were observed. The results in these healthy subjects suggest that batifiban coadministrated with antithrombin agents could achieve optimum clinical treatment effect for patients with NSTE ACS, and also those scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention.","['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Aspirin', 'China', 'Clopidogrel', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fibrinolytic Agents', 'Heparin', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Peptides, Cyclic', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors', 'Ticlopidine', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",24142738,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.740.200', 'G03.787.101', 'G07.690.725.064', 'N06.850.520.830.200'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595.176'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['D02.886.778.823.500.500', 'D03.383.725.849.500.500', 'D03.383.903.830.500.500', 'D03.633.100.928.500.500'], ['E02.319.283'], ['D27.505.519.421.750', 'D27.505.954.411.320', 'D27.505.954.502.427'], ['D09.698.373.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.082.500', 'E02.319.267.510.590'], ['E02.319.267.082.750', 'E02.319.267.530.540'], ['E01.370.225.843', 'E05.200.843', 'G03.490', 'G07.690.595', 'G07.690.725.513'], ['D04.345.566', 'D12.644.641'], ['D27.505.954.502.780'], ['D02.886.778.823.500', 'D03.383.725.849.500', 'D03.383.903.830.500', 'D03.633.100.928.500'], ['G01.910.857'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
2391,Expression of á-crystallin in the retina of human sympathetic ophthalmia.,"Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is a bilateral, granulomatous, intraocular inflammation that occurs following a penetrating injury to one eye, and has the potential to cause blindness of both eyes. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of á-crystallin and to detect apoptotic cells in the retina of human eyes with SO. Five globes, including three with SO and two age-matched normal appearing retinae, were examined. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were submitted to hematoxylin and eosin staining and immuno-histochemistry with anti-áA and áB-crystallin antibodies. Apoptotic cells were detected using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method, and double-staining immunohistochemistry was conducted together with the TUNEL reaction. In normal-appearing retina, áA-crystallin immunoreactivity was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm of photoreceptors, where áB-crystallin was less marked. In SO globes, granulomatous inflammation was noted in the choroid, whereas the retina and choriocapillaris were preserved. Immunoreactivity for áA-crystallin was detected in the retina, as well as in the cytoplasm and inner/outer photoreceptor segments. By contrast, áB-crystallin was weakly noted in the SO retina. Double-staining immuno-histochemistry revealed no TUNEL-positive photoreceptors in the retina displaying high immunoreactivity for áA-crystallin, but photoreceptor apoptosis was noted where expression of áA-crystallin was relatively low. The present study demonstrated that áA-crystallin was up-regulated in the cytoplasm of photoreceptors in the SO retina. This may play a protective role in the suppression of photoreceptor apoptosis associated with intraocular inflammation.","['Apoptosis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Ophthalmia, Sympathetic', 'Photoreceptor Cells', 'Retina', 'alpha-Crystallin A Chain', 'alpha-Crystallin B Chain', 'alpha-Crystallins']",22052021,"[['G04.146.954.035'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E05.393.475'], ['C11.941.879.780.500', 'C20.111.709'], ['A08.675.650.850.625', 'A08.675.650.915.937', 'A08.800.950.937', 'A09.371.729.831.625', 'A11.671.650.850.625', 'A11.671.650.915.937'], ['A09.371.729'], ['D12.776.306.366.100.149', 'D12.776.580.157.149'], ['D12.776.306.366.100.300', 'D12.776.580.157.300'], ['D12.776.306.366.100', 'D12.776.580.157']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Approximately 27% of these men and 20% of these women showed current Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Resistance veterans, as a group, appeared comparable to the controls from Dutch validation studies on trait anxiety and depression. Gender differences were not observed. Veterans with current PTSD symptoms scored higher on trait anxiety and depression than the remaining veterans and were comparable on trait anxiety and depression to psychiatric patients. Correlational analyses showed that there was a strong association between trait anxiety and depression. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder correlated highly with trait anxiety and depression.","['Aged', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Combat Disorders', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Female', 'Gender Identity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Personality Inventory', 'Veterans', 'Warfare']",8153220,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['F03.080'], ['F03.950.750.249'], ['I01.076.201.450.281', 'I01.880.853.100.257'], ['F03.600.300'], ['F01.393.446.250', 'F01.752.747.385.200', 'F01.752.747.722.200', 'F02.739.794.793.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['F04.711.647.513'], ['M01.930'], ['I01.880.735.950.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
45381,Angiotensin converting enzyme gene polymorphism and activity in Turkish patients with essential hypertension.,"Studies in various ethnic groups have shown contradictory evidence on the association of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/ deletion (I/D) polymorphism with essential hypertension. We conducted a case-control study in Samsun, Turkey, to examine the association between ACE genotype, ACE serum activity, and blood pressure. Serum ACE activity was measured and ACE I/D polymorphism performed in 165 hypertensive and 143 normotensive subjects. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR primers were flanking the polymorphic region in intron 16 of the ACE gene. The distribution of the DD, ID, and II ACE genotypes was 65, 77, and 23 in hypertensive patients and 42, 82, and 19 in normotensive subjects (P > .05). The estimated frequency of the insertion allele was 0.37 in hypertensive and 0.42 in normotensive subjects. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis, based on positive family history and severity of hypertension, suggested that significant associations existed between more homogeneous groups of hypertensives and normotensives (P < .05). ACE genotype influenced ACE activity and the highest level was in DD genotype, being the lowest in II genotype. ACE serum levels were significantly higher in hypertensives as compared with normotensives (P < .01). A modest correlation was observed between blood pressure and ACE among hypertensive persons (r = 0.25, P < .05) and this did persist in multivariate analysis (P < .05 for systolic blood pressure and P < .005 for diastolic blood pressure). These data suggest that ACE DD genotype may have predisposing effects on severe hypertensives and cases with positive family history, and that ACE may be one of the independent factors on hypertension.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",10560791,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D08.811.277.656.350.350.687'], ['G05.365.795']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
43503,PD-L1 expression in small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas.,"Small cell lung cancer and extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas are the most aggressive type of neuroendocrine carcinomas. Clinical treatment relies on conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy; relapses are frequent. The PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 pathway is a major target of anti-tumour immunotherapy. Aberrant PD-L1 or PD-L2 expression may cause local immune-suppression. Here we investigated expression of PD-1 and its ligands by immunohistochemistry and RNA-seq in small cell carcinomas. PD-L1 and PD-1 protein expression were analysed in 94 clinical cases of small cell carcinomas (61 pulmonary, 33 extrapulmonary) by immunohistochemistry using two different monoclonal antibodies (5H1, E1L3N). RNA expression was profiled by RNA-seq in 43 clinical cases. None of the small cell carcinomas showed PD-L1 protein expression in tumour cells. PD-L1 and PD-1 expression was noticed in the stroma: Using immunohistochemistry, 18.5% of cases (17/92) showed PD-L1 expression in tumour-infiltrating macrophages and 48% showed PD-1 positive lymphocytes (45/94). RNA-seq showed moderate PD-L1 gene expression in 37.2% (16/43). PD-L1 was correlated with macrophage and T-cell markers. The second PD-1 ligand PD-L2 was expressed in 27.9% (12/43) and showed similar correlations. Thus, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway seems activated in a fraction of small cell carcinomas. The carcinoma cells were negative in all cases, PD-L1 was expressed in tumour-infiltrating macrophages and was correlated with tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. Patients with stromal PD-L1/PD-L2 expression may respond to anti-PD-1 treatment. Thus, evaluation of the composition of the tumour microenvironment should be included in clinical trials. Besides conventional immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq seems suitable for detection of PD-L1/PD-L2 expression and might prove to be more sensitive.","['B7-H1 Antigen', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating', 'Macrophages', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",25582496,"[['D12.776.465.625', 'D12.776.467.150.300', 'D12.776.543.095.300', 'D23.050.301.285.400', 'D23.529.168.300'], ['C04.557.470.200.380'], ['G05.308.370'], ['E05.393.760.319'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.650', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.650', 'A15.382.490.555.567.650'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['C04.697.650', 'C23.550.727.650'], ['C04.557.465.625.650', 'C04.557.580.625.650'], ['D12.776.465.829', 'D12.776.467.150.800', 'D12.776.543.095.800', 'D23.050.301.285.800', 'D23.529.168.800'], ['D12.776.465.844', 'D12.776.543.750.705.222.875', 'D23.050.301.264.894.790', 'D23.101.100.894.790'], ['E05.588.570.850']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

All met the screening requirement of a mean sleep latency of 30 min or greater on 3 laboratory nights following an adaptation night. Of these patients 34 still complaining of insomnia were screened a second time 2 to 6 months later. Sixteen of the 34 failed the second screen. Sleep parameters for the 34 on screen 1 compared with screen 2 were the same except for sleep latency (the eligibility criteria), which was significantly shorter.

25924,Striking regression of chronic radiotherapy damage in a clinical trial of combined pentoxifylline and tocopherol.,"PURPOSE: Radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) remains the most morbid complication of radiotherapy because of the absence of spontaneous regression and the difficulty of patient management. RIF treatment with combined pentoxifylline (PTX) and tocopherol (Vit E) was prompted by recent advances in cellular and molecular biology that have improved researchers' understanding of radiation-induced late-injury mechanisms and by the excellent results from our previous human and animal studies.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients (mean [+/- SD] age, 59 +/- 10 years) presenting with 50 symptomatic RIF areas involving the skin and underlying tissues were treated from April 1995 to September 1997. Patients had had radiotherapy for head and neck or breast cancer a mean period of 8.5 +/- 6.5 years previously. RIF developed in the first year after irradiation and gradually worsened, without spontaneous regression. The mean measurable surface area of RIF ([S]) at the time of this study ([S(0)]) was 42 +/- 34 cm(2). The initial Subjective Objective Medical management and Analytic (SOMA) injury evaluation score was 13.2 +/- 5.9 and included evidence of edema, plexitis, restricted movement, and local inflammatory signs. A combination of PTX (800 mg/d) and Vit E (1,000 IU/d) was administered orally for at least 6 months.RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated. All assessable injuries exhibited continuous clinical regression and functional improvement. Mean RIF surface area and SOMA scores improved significantly (P <.0001) at 3 months ([S(3)], -39%; [SOMA(3)], -22%), 6 months ([S(6)], -53%; [SOMA(6)], -35%), and 12 months ([S(12)], -66%; [SOMA(12)], -48%), and mean linear dimensions ([D]) diminished from the start of the study ([D(0)], 6.5 +/- 2.5 cm) to the end of treatment 12 months later ([D(12)], 4 +/- 2 cm). At the time of the treatment, we did not attempt to achieve the maximum effect, and the study was continued.CONCLUSION: The PTX-Vit E combination reversed human chronic radiotherapy damage and, because no other treatment is presently available for RIF, should be considered as a therapeutic measure.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentoxifylline', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Radiation-Protective Agents', 'Radiotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vitamin E']",10506631,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['E02.319.310'], ['C04.588.443'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.633.100.759.758.824.651.700'], ['C08.381.765'], ['C26.733', 'G01.750.748.500', 'N06.850.460.350.850.500', 'N06.850.810.300.360'], ['D27.505.696.706.776', 'D27.720.799.763'], ['E02.815'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D03.383.663.283.909', 'D03.633.100.150.909']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
32759,Racial/Ethnic and Socioeconomic Disparities in Hydration Status Among US Adults and the Role of Tap Water and Other Beverage Intake.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether differences in tap water and other beverage intake explain differences in inadequate hydration among US adults by race/ethnicity and income.METHODS: We estimated the prevalence of inadequate hydration (urine osmolality ? 800 mOsm/kg) by race/ethnicity and income of 8258 participants aged 20 to 74 years in the 2009 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Using multivariable regression models, we estimated associations between demographic variables, tap water intake, and inadequate hydration.RESULTS: The prevalence of inadequate hydration among US adults was 29.5%. Non-Hispanic Blacks (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17, 1.76) and Hispanics (AOR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.21, 1.67) had a higher risk of inadequate hydration than did non-Hispanic Whites. Lower-income adults had a higher risk of inadequate hydration than did higher-income adults (AOR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.45). Differences in tap water intake partially attenuated racial/ethnic differences in hydration status. Differences in total beverage and other fluid intake further attenuated sociodemographic disparities.CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in inadequate hydration among US adults are related to differences in tap water and other beverage intake.

41848,Human RNF169 is a negative regulator of the ubiquitin-dependent response to DNA double-strand breaks.,"Nonproteolytic ubiquitylation of chromatin surrounding deoxyribonucleic acid double-strand breaks (DSBs), mediated by the RNF8/RNF168 ubiquitin ligases, plays a key role in recruiting repair factors, including 53BP1 and BRCA1, to reestablish genome integrity. In this paper, we show that human RNF169, an uncharacterized E3 ubiquitin ligase paralogous to RNF168, accumulated in DSB repair foci through recognition of RNF168-catalyzed ubiquitylation products by its motif interacting with ubiquitin domain. Unexpectedly, RNF169 was dispensable for chromatin ubiquitylation and ubiquitin-dependent accumulation of repair factors at DSB sites. Instead, RNF169 functionally competed with 53BP1 and RAP80-BRCA1 for association with RNF168-modified chromatin independent of its catalytic activity, limiting the magnitude of their recruitment to DSB sites. By delaying accumulation of 53BP1 and RAP80 at damaged chromatin, RNF169 stimulated homologous recombination and restrained nonhomologous end joining, affecting cell survival after DSB infliction. Our results show that RNF169 functions in a noncanonical fashion to harness RNF168-mediated protein recruitment to DSB-containing chromatin, thereby contributing to regulation of DSB repair pathway utilization.","['BRCA1 Protein', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA End-Joining Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Homologous Recombination', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1', 'Ubiquitin', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitination', 'Zinc Fingers']",22492721,"[['D12.776.313.125', 'D12.776.624.776.100', 'D12.776.660.100', 'D12.776.744.100', 'D12.776.930.137'], ['D12.776.157'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.284.430.106.279.345.190.160.180', 'D12.776.664.224', 'G05.360.160.180'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G05.200.210.220'], ['G02.111.222.200', 'G05.219.200'], ['D12.776.260'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['D12.776.580.219'], ['G05.728.615'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.360', 'D12.776.476'], ['D12.776.660'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['D12.776.260.805', 'D12.776.660.235.850', 'D12.776.664.235.950'], ['D12.776.947.500'], ['D08.811.464.938.750'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600.925', 'G02.111.691.600.775', 'G03.734.871.790.600.831', 'G05.308.670.600.831'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500.985']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18866,[Left hepatic vein injury during laparoscopic fundoplication for giant paraoesophageal hiatal hernia].,"INTRODUCTION: After laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic fundoplication has become another gold standard of minimal invasive surgery. The level of satisfaction of patients undergoing endoscopic surgery is almost 90%. Laparoscopic fundoplication, like other surgery methods, can also be burdened with grave complications, which could result in a fatal outcome even if the surgery is performed by a skilled surgeon. Even the authors themselves encounter complications despite their rich experience (more than 3,500 laparoscopic operations in the diaphragmatic hiatus area in more than 20 years).CASE REPORT: The authors report on a rare left hepatic vein injury during laparoscopic hiatoplasty and fundoplication according to Toupet for giant paraoesophageal hiatal hernia.CONCLUSION: For its low percentage of complications, laparoscopic fundoplication is considered as a safe operative method for gastroesophageal reflux disease and hiatal hernias. However, severe complications may still arise during the surgery and the surgeon should be familiar with them, be prepared for them and be able to manage such complications.Key words: gastroesophageal reflux disease hiatal hernia laparoscopic fundoplication left hepatic vein.","['Fundoplication', 'Gastroesophageal Reflux', 'Hepatic Veins', 'Hernia, Hiatal', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy']",28433047,"[['E04.210.390'], ['C06.405.117.119.500.484'], ['A07.015.908.380'], ['C23.300.707.960.500.467'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.388.250.520', 'E04.502.250.520']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
32354,Inhibition of hypochlorous acid-mediated reactions by desferrioxamine. Implications for the mechanism of cellular injury by neutrophils.,"Inhibition of free radical mechanisms by desferrioxamine, an iron chelator, is often thought to be a good indicator of iron-catalyzed hydroxyl radical (OH.) production. The specificity of desferrioxamine is critical for such identification. This study was undertaken to determine whether desferrioxamine could prevent the in vitro cytotoxic reactions of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a major neutrophil-derived oxidant. Red blood cells were used as a target for HOCl, and cell lysis and haemoglobin oxidation were measured. Desferrioxamine, and its iron-chelated form, ferrioxamine, were shown to prevent both effects of HOCl. However, desferrioxamine was 6 to 8 times more efficient than either ferrioxamine or taurine, another amine which prevents HOCl-mediated cell lysis, in preventing both lysis and Hb oxidation. After reaction with HOCl, ferrioxamine and taurine retained almost all the oxidizing equivalents as long-lived chloramine. However, with desferrioxamine less than half the oxidizing equivalents were recovered as chloramines indicating that sites other than the terminal amine reacted with HOCl. The chloramines formed were able to oxidize molecules in solution, but being hydrophilic they were confined to the extracellular medium and cell lysis did not occur. The results indicate that scavenging of HOCl could be a factor in the inhibition by desferrioxamine of neutrophil-mediated cell lysis in vitro.","['Chloramines', 'Deferoxamine', 'Erythrocyte Membrane', 'Free Radicals', 'Hemoglobins', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Hypochlorous Acid', 'Iron', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neutrophils']",2165973,"[['D01.210.150', 'D02.092.348'], ['D02.092.570.394.265', 'D02.241.511.372.265'], ['A11.118.290.270', 'A11.284.149.356', 'A15.145.229.334.270'], ['D01.339', 'D02.389'], ['D12.776.124.400', 'D12.776.422.316.762'], ['C23.550.403', 'G12.122.545'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.029.260.365', 'D01.210.465', 'D01.339.431.311', 'D01.650.550.400'], ['D01.268.556.412', 'D01.268.956.287', 'D01.552.544.412'], ['G02.111.570', 'G02.466'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23621,Characterization and Use of a Fiber Optic Sensor Based on PAH/SiO2,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a compact probe that can be used to monitor humidity in ventilator care equipment. A mesoporous film of alternate layers of Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and silica (SiO2) nanoparticles (bilayers), deposited onto an optical fibre was used. The sensing film behaves as a Fabry-Perot cavity of low-finesse where the absorption of water vapour changes the optical thickness and produces a change in reflection proportional to humidity.METHODS: The mesoporous film was deposited upon the cleaved tip of an optical fibre using the layer-by-layer method. The sensor was calibrated in a bench model against a commercially available capacitive sensor. The sensitivity and response time were assessed in the range from 5 % relative humidity (RH) to 95%RH for different numbers of bilayers up to a maximum of nine.RESULTS: The sensitivity increases with the number of bilayers deposited; sensitivity of 2.28 mV/%RH was obtained for nine bilayers. The time constant of the response was 1.13 s ± 0.30 s which is faster than the commercial device (measured as 158 s). After calibration, the optical fibre humidity sensor was utilised in a bench top study employing a mechanical ventilator. The fast response time enabled changes in humidity in individual breaths to be resolved.CONCLUSION: Optical fibre sensors have the potential to be used to monitor breath to breath humidity during ventilator care.SIGNIFICANCE: Control of humidity is an essential part of critical respiratory care and the developed sensor provides a sensitive, compact and fast method of humidity monitoring.","['Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Fiber Optic Technology', 'Humidity', 'Interferometry', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Nanoconjugates', 'Optical Fibers', 'Polyamines', 'Refractometry', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Transducers']",26829771,"[['E05.320'], ['E05.325.192'], ['H01.671.617.249'], ['G16.500.275.063.725.310', 'G16.500.750.775.310', 'N06.230.150.372', 'N06.230.300.100.725.310'], ['E05.490'], ['D25.479', 'J01.637.051.479', 'J01.637.087.500'], ['D26.255.260.600', 'E02.319.300.380.600', 'J01.637.512.600.577'], ['E07.632.750'], ['D02.092.782'], ['E05.196.808', 'H01.671.617.755'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E02.041.625', 'E02.365.647.729', 'E02.880.820'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['D01.578.750', 'D01.650.550.825', 'D01.837.725'], ['E07.305.812']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0

18862,Multivariate analysis of factors predicting local relapse after radical prostatectomy--possible indications for postoperative radiotherapy.,"Between 1970 and 1983, 273 patients underwent radical surgery (radical prostatectomy--261, radical cystoprostatectomy--12) for newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the prostate at Duke University Medical Center and received no adjuvant radiotherapy. A total of 46 patients developed local recurrence. Forty developed local relapse only and six developed simultaneous local and distant failure. The crude local relapse rate was 17% (46/273). The actuarial local failure rate at 5, 10, and 15 years was 12%, 32%, and 35%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of local relapse after radical surgery. Possible prognostic factors analyzed were: age, type of biopsy, use of adjuvant hormonal therapy, histologic grade, histologic involvement of seminal vesicles, positive surgical margins, clinical stage, and elevated acid phosphatase. Factors identified as significant predictors of local relapse by univariate analysis were: poorly differentiated histology (p = 0.0001), seminal vesicle involvement (p = 0.0009), and positive surgical margins (p = 0.0001). An elevated preoperative acid phosphatase was of borderline significance (p = 0.06). On multivariate analysis, poorly differentiated histology (p = 0.0007), positive margins (p = 0.0015), and elevated acid phosphatase (p = 0.0273) were significant predictors of local failure. Seminal vesicle involvement was no longer a significant predictor of local failure. However, on subsequent univariate and multivariate analyses, seminal vesicle involvement was the only significant predictor for the development of distant metastases (p = 0.0019, multivariate). Thus, patients with poorly differentiated tumors, positive surgical margins, or elevated preoperative acid phosphatase are at high risk for local relapse after radical prostatectomy. These patients should be included in future clinical trials studying the role of adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy, or offered adjuvant radiotherapy if they cannot or will not participate in such trials.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1917623,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789'], ['E04.950.774.860.625'], ['C04.588.945.440.770', 'C12.294.260.750', 'C12.294.565.625', 'C12.758.409.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
47694,Local changes in bone marrow at MRI after treatment of extremity soft tissue sarcoma.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and appearance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal changes that occur in local bone marrow after radiation therapy (RT) and/or chemotherapy for extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy patients with primary STS at the level of a long bone who also had undergone pretreatment MRI and at least one post-treatment MRI of the tumor bed were identified. MRIs of each patient were retrospectively reviewed for new changes in marrow signal in the region of the tumor bed and for the morphology, relative signal intensities, heterogeneity, and progression or regression of changes over time.RESULTS: Focal signal changes in marrow were observed in 26/70 patients (37%) at a median of 9.5 months after RT and/or chemotherapy and diffuse changes in seven (10%) at a median of 8 months. Patients who received neither RT nor chemotherapy did not develop marrow changes. Mean RT doses in patients with changes and those without were 5,867 and 6,076 cGy, respectively. In most patients with focal changes, changes were seen in all sequences and were linear-curvilinear, patchy, or mixed at the level of the tumor bed. Predominant signal intensity of changes was between muscle and fat at T1WI and between muscle and fluid at fat-saturated T2WI or short tau inversion recovery. Most focal changes enhanced heterogeneously and increased or fluctuated in size over time.CONCLUSION: Changes in MRI appearance of long bone marrow frequently are evident after combined RT and chemotherapy for STS and most commonly increase or fluctuate in size over time. These changes have various non-mass-like configurations and often show signal intensities similar to those of red marrow and thus should not be mistaken for metastases. The marrow changes might represent an early stage of gelatinous transformation of marrow.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Contrast Media', 'Disease Progression', 'Extremities', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms']",18704399,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['A15.382.216'], ['E02.186'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['A01.378'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C04.557.450.795'], ['C04.588.839']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
4304,Aberrant expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2 (erbB-2) messenger RNAs in human renal cancers.,"Amplification, rearrangement, or overexpression of the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) occurs in certain types of human neoplasia. We investigated EGFR gene structure and measured EGFR mRNA levels in human renal tumor biopsies. Seventeen renal tumors [13 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), two Wilms' tumors, one oncocytoma, and one metastatic ganglioneuroblastoma] and their corresponding normal kidney tissues were examined for EGFR gene structural integrity by Southern blot hybridization. Twelve of these tumors (including 11 RCCs) were examined for EGFR mRNA expression levels by RNA blot hybridization. The EGFR gene was rearranged in one of 13 (8%) of the RCC specimens examined and was highly amplified in the ganglioneuroblastoma. The overall frequency of EGFR gene structure alterations in this series of renal tumors was 12%. Nine of 11 RCC specimens (82%) exhibited markedly elevated EGFR mRNA levels (approximately 2- to 6-fold). In contrast, expression of the EGFR-related protooncogene HER-2 (erbB-2) was found to be decreased in 11 RCCs and one Wilms' tumor; HER-2 gene structure, however, appeared normal in all specimens. These results indicate that overexpression of EGFR mRNA, probably due to changes in gene regulation, and underexpression of HER-2 mRNA are characteristic features of human RCC.","['Actins', 'Animals', 'Chick Embryo', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Reference Values', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2572319,"[['D05.750.078.730.250', 'D12.776.210.500.100', 'D12.776.220.525.255'], ['B01.050'], ['A13.350.150', 'A16.331.200'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.360.340.024.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04'], ['D12.776.624.664.700'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500.791'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074.400', 'D12.776.624.664.700.642', 'D23.050.301.500.600.700', 'D23.050.705.552.600.550', 'D23.101.140.642'], ['E05.978.810'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9314,Geriatric psychiatry training: a brief clinical rotation.,"Burgeoning interest in geriatric psychiatry has created a challenge of optimally fitting geriatric content into already crowded psychiatric residency curricula. The authors review general considerations in geriatric psychiatry training and describe a brief clinical rotation for working with the elderly. The brief rotation is not presented as the ideal way of imparting geriatric psychiatry skills, but as an effective use of limited time to improve one's approach to the older patient. The clinical rotation enables the resident to learn more about psychiatric issues in later life, as well as to acquire a better perspective on other parts of the life cycle and on other aspects of psychiatry.","['Aged', 'Community Mental Health Services', 'Curriculum', 'Female', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Humans', 'Internship and Residency', 'Mental Disorders', 'Patient Care Team', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'United States']",7356055,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['F04.408.307', 'N02.421.143.183', 'N02.421.461.232'], ['I02.158'], ['F04.096.544.380', 'H02.403.690.260'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I02.358.337.350.500', 'I02.358.399.350.750'], ['F03'], ['N04.590.715'], ['F01.829.401.650.675', 'N05.300.660.625'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
7671,Long-chain fatty alcohols from evening primrose oil inhibit the inflammatory response in murine peritoneal macrophages.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Evening primrose (Oenothera biennis L., Onagraceae) is a wild medicinal plant of Central American origin that is now one of the most widely used herbal medicines in different parts of the world. Oil extracted from it seeds is traditionally used in the treatment of eczema, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, breast problem, premenstrual and menopausal syndrome, all they have an inflammatory component. The present study demonstrates the in vitro anti-inflammatory effect of long-chain fatty alcohols, minor compounds isolated from Evening primrose oil (EPO).MATERIAL AND METHODS: A mixture of long chain fatty alcohols (LCFAs) was isolated from the non-triacylglycerol fraction of the EPO. Hexacosanol (C26OH: 38.65%), tetracosanol (C24OH: 31.59%), docosanol (C22OH: 11.36%) and octocosanol (C28OH: 7.64%), were the major constituents, identified and quantified by GC and GC-MS. LCFA was tested with LPS stimulated murine peritoneal macrophage. This fraction, significantly and dose-dependently decreased nitric oxide production induced by LPS (P<0.001) and the inhibitory effect seems to be consequence of an action at the level of the inducible nitric-oxide synthethase (iNOS) gene enzyme expression rather than to a direct inhibitory action on enzyme activity. The release of PLA2 and TXB2 also was significantly inhibited by LCFAs (P<0.001) although LCFAs did not affect to PGE2 generation, however the western blot assay showed that LCFAs reduced cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme gene expression at all doses assayed. In the same way, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1â (IL-1â) and tumour necrosis factor á (TNF-á) from LPS-stimulated murine macrophage, were also significantly reduced (P<0.001).CONCLUSION: These results demonstrates the anti-inflammatory activity of LCFAs, providing an additional value about the role of bioactive minor compounds in the beneficial effect of EPO and supports its traditional uses in inflammatory processes management.","['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Dinoprostone', 'Fatty Alcohols', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-1beta', 'Linoleic Acids', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal', 'Mice', 'Nitrites', 'Phospholipases A2, Secretory', 'Plant Oils', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'gamma-Linolenic Acid']",24239848,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.346'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.200'], ['D02.033.415', 'D10.289'], ['G05.308'], ['C23.550.470'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.010.600', 'D12.644.276.374.500.400.600', 'D12.776.467.374.465.010.600', 'D12.776.467.374.500.400.600', 'D23.529.374.465.131.600', 'D23.529.374.500.400.600'], ['D10.251.355.310.515', 'D10.251.355.343.500'], ['A11.329.372.630', 'A11.627.482.630', 'A11.733.397.630', 'A15.382.670.522.630', 'A15.382.680.397.630'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D01.248.497.158.635', 'D01.625.600.600', 'D02.633'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.680.750.937.750'], ['D10.627.700', 'D20.215.784.750'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.825.810', 'D10.251.355.310.166.971.810'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626'], ['D10.251.355.310.640.425', 'D10.251.355.343.249']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

31303,Effect of cimetidine on absorption of oral tetracycline in mice.,"Gastric administration of cimetidine, 5 mg/kg, and magnesium aluminum hydroxide gel (Maalox), 1 ml/kg, were equally effective raising the gastric pH of mice from 2.5 to 5.0. The antacid depressed by 75% gastrointestinal absorption of tetracycline given by gastric tube at 25 mg/kg. Antibiotic bioavailability was measured by area under the plasma level-time curve, peak plasma level and urinary elimination. Cimetidine did not affect tetracycline absorption as reflected by any of these three parameters. If confirmed with the solid dosage form in man, the present study suggests that unlike magnesium aluminum hydroxide gel, cimetidine may be used as an effective means of reducing gastric acid in patients who take tetracycline.","['Administration, Oral', 'Aluminum Hydroxide', 'Animals', 'Antacids', 'Cimetidine', 'Drug Interactions', 'Gastric Juice', 'Guanidines', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Tetracycline', 'Time Factors']",7384196,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['D01.045.250.050', 'D01.056.037', 'D01.248.497.158.459.075'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.170', 'D27.505.954.483.080'], ['D02.078.370.200', 'D03.383.129.308.130'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['A12.200.307'], ['D02.078.370'], ['G02.300'], ['G03.015.500.374.500', 'G03.787.024.500.374.500', 'G07.203.650.372.500', 'G07.690.725.015.500.374.500', 'G10.261.353.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.900.875', 'D04.615.562.900.875'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18521,OMNI scale perceived exertion at ventilatory breakpoint in children: response normalized.,"PURPOSE: The Children's OMNI Scale of Perceived Exertion was used to identify a response normalized rating of perceived exertion (RPE)-Overall, RPE-Legs, and RPE-Chest that corresponds to the ventilatory breakpoint (Vpt) in 8- to 12-yr-old female and male children.METHODS: Subjects were a priori stratified into two fitness groups on the basis of peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak): average (A) (41.0-49.0 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); N = 24) and above average (AA) (50.0-58.0 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); N = 24). Vpt was determined by a progressive cycle ergometer protocol to VO2 peak.RESULTS: A gender effect was not observed for any descriptive or dependent variable. Mean VO2peak for the A group was 1.72 L x min(-1) and for the AA group 2.04 L x min(-1). Vpt corresponded to 64.0% VO2 peak for A and 74.0% VO2peak for AA. RPE-Overall (mean A and AA, 6.1), RPE-Legs (mean A and AA, 7.2), and RPE-Chest (mean A and AA, 4.5) did not differ between the fitness groups.CONCLUSION: Findings indicated that undifferentiated and differentiated RPE-Vpt were similar between female and male children who varied in VO2peak and Vpt. A comparatively stable RPE-Vpt for 8- to 12-yr-old children that vary in VO2peak and Vpt indicates a group normalized perceptual response.","['Anaerobic Threshold', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Leg', 'Male', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Physical Exertion', 'Physical Fitness', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sex Factors', 'Thorax']",11689748,"[['G03.680.110', 'G11.427.680.134'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A01.378.610.500'], ['G03.680'], ['G11.427.683'], ['G11.427.685', 'I03.450.642.845.054.800', 'N01.400.545'], ['E05.978.810'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['A01.923.761']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
21995,Fatal Canid herpesvirus 1 infection in an adult dog.,"Canid herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1) is a well-known cause of fatal hepatic and renal necrosis in neonatal puppies. In adult dogs infected with CaHV-1, papulovesicular genital lesions may be observed. CaHV-1 infection during pregnancy can lead to embryonic resorption, abortion, and stillbirth. In high-density dog populations, CaHV-1 can also contribute to kennel cough. Furthermore, recent literature has clearly documented that CaHV-1 can induce ocular disease in immature and adult dogs. The current study describes a case of fatal CaHV-1 infection in a 9-year-old spayed female Bichon Frise dog. Following a history of vomiting and diarrhea, the dog deteriorated and subsequently died. The main lesions were multifocal areas of necrosis with intranuclear inclusion bodies in the liver, adrenal gland, and small intestine, similar to the lesions observed in CaHV-1-infected puppies. Infection with CaHV-1 was confirmed on samples of liver by polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. There was no indication of immunosuppression in this dog. Based on the results presented herein, CaHV-1 should be included in the list of differential diagnoses of hepatic necrosis in adult dogs.","['Animals', 'DNA, Viral', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae Infections', 'Herpesvirus 1, Canid', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Liver Diseases', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",22529135,"[['B01.050'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.325', 'N01.224.935.698.201', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.325', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.325'], ['C01.925.256.466'], ['B04.280.382.100.900.420'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670.325', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670.325', 'E05.200.500.620.670.325', 'E05.200.750.600.670.325', 'E05.393.661.475'], ['C06.552'], ['E05.393.620.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
25753,Voluntary- and Involuntary-Distraction Engagement: An Exploratory Study of Individual Differences.,"Objective The aim of this study was to explore individual differences in voluntary and involuntary driver-distraction engagement. Background Distractions may stem from intentional engagement in secondary tasks (voluntary) or failing to suppress non-driving-related stimuli or information (involuntary). A wealth of literature has examined voluntary distraction; involuntary distraction is not particularly well understood. Individual factors, such as age, are known to play a role in how drivers engage in distractions. However, it is unclear which individual factors are associated with voluntary- versus involuntary-distraction engagement and whether there is a relation between how drivers engage in these two distraction types. Method Thirty-six participants, ages 25 to 39, drove in a simulator under three conditions: voluntary distraction with a self-paced visual-manual task on a secondary display, involuntary distraction with abrupt onset of irrelevant visual-audio stimuli on the secondary display, and no distraction. Results The number of glances toward the secondary display under voluntary distraction was not correlated to that under involuntary distraction. The former was associated with gender, age, annual mileage, and self-reported distraction engagement; such associations were not observed for the latter. Accelerator release time in response to lead-vehicle braking was delayed similarly under both conditions. Conclusion Propensity to engage in voluntary distractions appears to be not related to the inability of suppressing involuntary distractions. Further, voluntary and involuntary distraction both affect braking response. These findings have implications for design of in-vehicle technologies, which may be sources of both distraction types.","['Adult', 'Attention', 'Distracted Driving', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Individuality', 'Male', 'Psychomotor Performance']",29489421,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F02.830.104.214'], ['I03.125.474'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.488'], ['F02.808', 'G11.427.700', 'G11.561.660']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
668,Acetaldehyde accumulation in rat mammary tissue after an acute treatment with alcohol.,"Previous studies reported the presence in rat mammary tissue of a cytosolic xanthine oxidoreductase pathway for the metabolism of alcohol to acetaldehyde and hydroxyl radicals and to the microsomal biotransformation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. It was also reported that after chronic ethanol drinking stressful oxidative conditions can be observed. The present work reports that even after single doses of ethanol, given at three different levels (6.3 g kg(-1); 3.8 g kg(-1) or 0.6 g kg(-1) p.o.), acetaldehyde accumulates for prolonged periods of time in the mammary tissue to reach concentrations higher than in blood (e.g. 5.1+/-1.2 nmol g(-1) versus 0.2+/-0.1 nmol ml(-1), for 6.3 g kg(-1) dose, 6 h after intoxication). The presence in rat mammary tissue of low activities of additional enzymes able to generate acetaldehyde was established (alcohol dehydrogenase: 0.97+/-0.84 mU mg(-1) protein; CYP2E1: 1.30+/-0.12 x 10(-2) pmol 4-nitrocatechol min(-1) mg(-1) protein) and a low activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase was observed in the cytosolic, mitochondrial and microsomal fractions (0.02+/-0.04; 0.35+/-0.09 and 0.72+/-0.19 mU mg(-1) protein, respectively). After a single high dose of ethanol, an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress was observed, as evidenced by changes in the shape of t-butylhydroperoxide induced emission of chemiluminescence in mammary tissue (6.3 g kg(-1) dose; at 3 and 6 h). In summary, the results show that even after single doses of ethanol, acetaldehyde, either formed in situ or arriving via blood, tends to accumulate in mammary tissue and that this condition might decrease cell defenses against injury.","['Acetaldehyde', 'Alcohol Dehydrogenase', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase', 'Animals', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Mammary Glands, Animal', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Rats', 'Subcellular Fractions']",17590863,"[['D02.047.064'], ['D08.811.682.047.820.250'], ['D08.811.682.657.163.249'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.696.277', 'D27.505.954.427.210'], ['D08.244.453.491.375', 'D08.811.682.662.582.338', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.450.375', 'D12.776.422.220.453.491.375'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D02.033.375'], ['E05.196.712.516'], ['A10.336.482', 'A13.589'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['A11.284.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
43318,Role of Swi6/HP1 self-association-mediated recruitment of Clr4/Suv39 in establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin in fission yeast.,"Swi6/HP1, an evolutionarily conserved protein, is critical for heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast and higher eukaryotes. In fission yeast, histone deacetylation by histone deacetylases is thought to be followed by H3-Lys-9 methylation by the histone methyltransferase Clr4/Suv39H1. H3-Lys-9-Me2 interacts with the chromodomain of Swi6/HP1. Swi6/HP1 is thought to act downstream of Clr4/Suv39, and further self-association of Swi6/HP1 is assumed to stabilize the heterochromatin structure. Here, we show that the self-association-defective mutant of Swi6 does not interact with Clr4. It not only fails to localize to heterochromatin loci but also interferes with heterochromatic localization of H3-Lys-9-Me2 (and thereby Clr4) and the endogenous Swi6 in a dominant negative manner. Thus, self-association of Swi6/HP1 helps in binding to and recruitment of Clr4 and thereby in establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin by a concerted rather than a sequential mechanism.","['Acetylation', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Heterochromatin', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Schizosaccharomyces', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins']",21224386,"[['G02.111.012.052', 'G02.607.063.052', 'G03.040.052'], ['D12.776.167'], ['D12.776.660.235', 'D12.776.664.235'], ['A11.284.430.106.279.345.190.160.180.383', 'D12.776.664.224.466', 'G05.360.160.180.383'], ['D08.811.913.555.500.800.200'], ['D08.811.913.555.500.800.200.500'], ['D12.776.157.687.485', 'D12.776.660.720.485', 'D12.776.664.469'], ['G02.111.035.538', 'G02.607.094.538', 'G03.059.538'], ['D08.811.913.555.500'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['B01.300.107.797', 'B01.300.930.720'], ['D12.776.354.875']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23490,Acetaminophen metabolism and cytotoxicity in PC12 cells transfected with cytochrome P4502E1.,"Although a number of studies confirm the important role of metabolites in the cytotoxicity of acetaminophen, its precise mechanisms remain unknown. Acetaminophen is metabolized by microsomal enzymes. Cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) mediated N-hydroxylation results in the formation of N-acetyl-benzo-quinoneimine, a highly reactive intermediate. We examined biochemical parameters related to necrotic and apoptotic processes in acetaminophen-exposed PC12 cells is and in a PC12 cell line genetically engineered to express human CYP2E1. Both the [3H]thymidine incorporation test and the protein assay uniformly showed dose- and time-related significant growth retardation in both cell lines exposed to the drug. This was more evident in CYP2E1-transfected cells. Moreover, the cytotoxic effect of acetaminophen was increased as evidenced by lactate dehydrogenase activity in the culture medium. Both random oligonucleotide primed synthesis assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed significant DNA fragmentation in both cell lines, which was greater in transfected cells, reaching about 11% of total cellular DNA. These results were confirmed by flow cytometry and microscopic examination of cell nuclei. Intracellular calcium levels were increased only in transfected cells, approximately threefold when 5 mM acetaminophen was administered for 48 h. These results indicate the cytotoxic effects of acetaminophen via apoptosis, necrosis, and growth retardation. While the precise mechanism remains obscure, it seems that DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cascade represent a preliminary biochemical event in acute cell death, and that acetaminophen bio-transformation by CYP2E1 stimulates this pathway.","['Acetaminophen', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Humans', 'PC12 Cells', 'Rats', 'Transfection']",9253715,"[['D02.065.199.092.040', 'D02.092.146.113.092.040'], ['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['G04.144'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D08.244.453.491.375', 'D08.811.682.662.582.338', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.450.375', 'D12.776.422.220.453.491.375'], ['G05.200.230'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.251.210.190.750', 'A11.251.860.180.750', 'A11.299.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7451,Stunting Mediates the Association between Small-for-Gestational-Age and Postneonatal Mortality.,"BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, one-third of all births are small for gestational age (SGA), and 4.4 million children are stunted; both conditions increase the risk of child mortality. SGA has also been shown to increase the risk of stunting.OBJECTIVE: We tested whether the association between SGA and postneonatal mortality is mediated by stunting.METHODS: We used longitudinal data from children aged 6 wk to 24 mo (n = 12,155) enrolled in the ZVITAMBO (Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies) trial. HIV exposure was defined based on maternal HIV status at baseline. SGA was defined as birthweight <10th percentile of the INTERGROWTH-21st (International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century) standards. We used a standard mediation approach by comparing the attenuation of the risk when the mediator was added to the model. We used Cox proportional hazards models first to regress SGA on postneonatal mortality, controlling for age. Stunting (length-for-age z score <-2) was then included in the model to test mediation.RESULTS: Approximately 20% of children were term SGA, and 23% were stunted before their last follow-up visit. In this cohort, 31% of children were exposed to HIV; the HIV-exposed group represented a pooled group of HIV-infected and HIV-exposed but uninfected children. Postneonatal mortality was significantly higher among children born SGA (HR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.7). This association was attenuated and not statistically significant when stunting was included in the model, suggesting a mediation effect (HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.3). When stratified by HIV exposure status, we observed a significant attenuation of the risk, suggesting mediation, only among HIV-exposed children (model 1, HR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.6; model 2, HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.3).CONCLUSIONS: This analysis aids in investigating pathways that underlie an observed SGA-mortality relation and may inform survival interventions in undernourished settings.","['Africa South of the Sahara', 'Birth Weight', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth Disorders', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Small for Gestational Age', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",27733526,"[['Z01.058.290'], ['C23.888.144.186', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.186', 'E05.041.124.160.750.149', 'G07.100.100.160.120.186', 'G07.345.249.314.120.186'], ['G07.345.500.325.235.968', 'G08.686.320'], ['C23.550.393'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.475', 'N01.224.935.698.489', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.475', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.475'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.703.520.460.560'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
8689,Acquired platinum resistance enhances tumour angiogenesis through angiotensin II type 1 receptor in bladder cancer.,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and angiogenesis through angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) after the development of acquired platinum resistance in bladder cancer.METHODS: Four invasive human bladder cancer cell lines, T24, 5637, T24PR, and 5637PR, were used in vitro, whereas in vivo, T24 and T24PR cells were used. T24PR and 5637PR cells were newly established at our institution as acquired platinum-resistant sublines by culturing in cisplatin (CDDP)-containing conditioned medium for 6 months.RESULTS: Ang II induced significantly higher vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in T24PR and 5637PR cells than in their corresponding parent cells in vitro, whereas Ang II induced a further increase in VEGF production. These platinum-resistant cells also showed significantly higher AT1R expression than their corresponding parent cells. ROS was also significantly upregulated in T24PR and 5637PR cells, whereas increased AT1R expression was significantly downregulated by scavenging free radicals. We also demonstrated the efficacy of AT1R blockade at suppressing the growth of platinum-resistant xenograft model.CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a new molecular mechanism for upregulated AT1R signalling through increased ROS when tumours progressed after the CDDP-based regimens, and shed light on the importance of AT1R blockade for platinum-resistant bladder cancers.","['Angiotensin II', 'Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers', 'Animals', 'Antipyrine', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Edaravone', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A']",21970881,"[['D06.472.699.094.078', 'D12.644.400.070.078', 'D12.644.456.073.041', 'D12.644.548.058.078', 'D12.776.631.650.070.078', 'D23.469.050.050.050'], ['D27.505.519.162.500'], ['B01.050'], ['D03.383.129.539.850.088'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['D01.210.375', 'D01.625.125', 'D01.710.100'], ['G07.690.773.984.395'], ['D03.383.129.539.850.088.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['C23.550.589.500'], ['D01.339.431', 'D01.650.775'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.047.625', 'D12.776.543.750.750.130.750'], ['C04.588.945.947.960', 'C12.758.820.968', 'C12.777.829.813', 'C13.351.937.820.945', 'C13.351.968.829.707'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
43853,Neurotensin receptor 1 determines the outcome of non-small cell lung cancer.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the role of the neurotensin/neurotensin receptor I (NTSR1) complex in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of neurotensin and NTSR1 was studied by transcriptome analysis and immunohistochemistry in two series of 74 and 139 consecutive patients with pathologic stage I NSCLC adenocarcinoma. The findings were correlated with clinic-pathologic features. Experimental tumors were generated from the malignant human lung carcinoma cell line A459, and a subclone of LNM35, LNM-R. The role of the neurotensin signaling system on tumor growth and metastasis was investigated by small hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of NTSR1 and neurotensin.RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis carried out in a series of 74 patients showed that the positive regulation of NTSR1 put it within the top 50 genes related with relapse-free survival. Immunohistochemistry revealed neurotensin- and NTSR1-positive staining in 60.4% and 59.7% of lung adenocarcinomas, respectively. At univariate analysis, NTSR1 expression was strongly associated with worse 5-year overall survival rate (P = 0.0081) and relapse-free survival (P = 0.0024). Multivariate analysis showed that patients over 65 years of age (P = 0.0018) and NTSR1 expression (P = 0.0034) were independent negative prognostic factors. Experimental tumor xenografts generated by neurotensin- and NTSR1-silenced human lung cancer cells revealed that neurotensin enhanced primary tumor growth and production of massive nodal metastasis via autocrine and paracrine regulation loops.CONCLUSION: NTSR1 expression was identified as a potential new prognostic biomarker for surgically resected stage I lung adenocarcinomas, as NTSR1 activation was shown to participate in lung cancer progression.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Neurotensin', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Neurotensin', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",20810387,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['B01.050'], ['C04.588.894.797.520.109.220.249', 'C08.381.540.140.500', 'C08.785.520.100.220.500'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['E05.393.332'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['C04.619', 'E05.598.500.496'], ['D12.644.400.550', 'D12.776.631.650.550'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['E01.789'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.550', 'D12.776.543.750.720.600.560', 'D12.776.543.750.750.555.560'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['E04.936.764']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
16219,An Australian survey of parent involvement in intervention for childhood speech sound disorders.,"PURPOSE: To investigate how speech-language pathologists (SLPs) report involving parents in intervention for phonology-based speech sound disorders (SSDs), and to describe the home practice that they recommend. Further aims were to describe the training SLPs report providing to parents, to explore SLPs' beliefs and motivations for involving parents in intervention, and to determine whether SLPs' characteristics are associated with their self-reported practice.METHOD: An online survey of 288 SLPs working with SSD in Australia was conducted.RESULT: The majority of SLPs (96.4%) reported involving parents in intervention, most commonly in providing home practice. On average, these tasks were recommended to be completed five times per week for 10 min. SLPs reported training parents using a range of training methods, most commonly providing opportunities for parents to observe the SLP conduct the intervention. SLPs' place of work and years of experience were associated with how they involved and trained parents in intervention. Most (95.8%) SLPs agreed or strongly agreed that family involvement is essential for intervention to be effective.CONCLUSION: Parent involvement and home practice appear to be intricately linked within intervention for phonology-based SSDs in Australia. More high-quality research is needed to understand how to best involve parents within clinical practice.","['Adult', 'Australia', 'Child', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parents', 'Speech Sound Disorder', 'Speech Therapy', 'Speech-Language Pathology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",28816080,"[['M01.060.116'], ['Z01.639.100', 'Z01.678.100.373'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['M01.526.485', 'N02.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.263.500.320', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340', 'M01.620'], ['F03.625.374.500'], ['E02.760.169.063.500.727.552', 'E02.831.727.552'], ['H02.010.750'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
44950,The role of Bax in glutamate-induced nerve cell death.,"The role of the Bax gene product was examined in three forms of cortical nerve cell death in primary cultures. These include spontaneous cell death, oxidative glutamate toxicity, in which exogenous glutamate inhibits cystine uptake resulting in toxic oxidative stress, and ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity following a brief exposure to 10 microM glutamate. Primary cortical and hippocampal neuron cultures were established from embryos of Bax -/+ x Bax -/+ matings and the embryos genotyped and assayed for cell death in the three experimental paradigms. Cell death induced by oxidative glutamate toxicity and glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity was not altered in the Bax -/- homozygous knockout animals. In contrast, there was an approximately 50% inhibition of spontaneous cell death. These results suggest that a classical Bax-dependent apoptotic pathway contributes to the spontaneous cell death that takes place when nerve cells are initially exposed to cell culture conditions. A Bax-dependent programmed cell death pathway is not, however, utilized in oxidative glutamate toxicity and NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity following a brief exposure to low concentrations of glutamate.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Receptors, Glutamate', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate', 'Staurosporine', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",11146002,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['G04.146'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['G05.380.383'], ['G05.380.554'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D12.776.624.664.700'], ['D12.644.360.075.718', 'D12.776.476.075.718', 'D12.776.624.664.700.169'], ['D12.776.543.750.720.200.450'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.500'], ['D03.132.436.750', 'D03.633.100.473.144.750', 'D03.633.100.473.402.750', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.750', 'D03.633.300.148.750'], ['D12.644.360.075.718.400', 'D12.776.476.075.718.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2854,Cauliflower growths in trophic ulcers of leprosy--a 10 year study.,"A 10 year study of cauliflower growths in trophic ulcers of leprosy patients was done. Seventy five cases were seen, out of which seventy two were in foot and three in hand.

24740,The Role of Socioeconomic Status and Health Care Access in Breast Cancer Screening Compliance Among Hispanics.,"OBJECTIVES: Considerable disparities in breast cancer screening exist between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Identifying and quantifying the factors contributing to these racial-ethnic disparities can help shape interventions and policies aimed at reducing these disparities. This study, for the first time, identified and quantified individual-level sociodemographic and health-related factors that contribute to racial-ethnic disparities in breast cancer screening using the nonlinear Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method.METHODS: Analysis of the retrospective pooled cross-sectional Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from 2000 to 2010 was conducted. Women aged 40 years and older were included in the study. Logistic regressions were used to estimate racial-ethnic disparities in breast cancer screening. Nonlinear Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was used to identify and quantify the contribution of each individual-level factor toward racial-ethnic disparities.RESULTS: Based on the unadjusted analyses, Hispanic women had lower odds of receiving mammogram screening (MS) (odds ratio [OR]: 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.80) and breast cancer screening (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.70-0.81) as compared with NHW women. However, the relationship reversed in adjusted analyses, such that Hispanic women had higher odds of receiving MS (OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.16-1.40) and breast cancer screening (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.17-1.40) as compared with NHW women. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition estimated that improving insurance status, access to care, education, and income will considerably increase screening rates among Hispanic women.CONCLUSIONS: The study projects that improving health care access and health education will considerably increase breast cancer screening compliance among Hispanic women. Policies like the Affordable Care Act, and patient navigation and health education interventions, might considerably reduce screening disparities in the Hispanic population.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Humans', 'Mammography', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Compliance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Class', 'United States']",25756197,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['E01.390.500'], ['N04.590.374.350', 'N05.300.430'], ['N04.590.374.380', 'N05.300.493'], ['M01.686.754.441'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.700.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.100.150.750.500.600', 'F01.145.488.887.500.600', 'N05.300.150.800.500.600'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['I01.880.853.996.755', 'N01.824.782'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
20997,Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition drives atherosclerosis progression.,"The molecular mechanisms responsible for the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions have not been fully established. Here, we investigated the role played by endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and its key regulator FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) in atherosclerosis. In cultured human endothelial cells, both inflammatory cytokines and oscillatory shear stress reduced endothelial FGFR1 expression and activated TGF-â signaling. We further explored the link between disrupted FGF endothelial signaling and progression of atherosclerosis by introducing endothelial-specific deletion of FGF receptor substrate 2 á (Frs2a) in atherosclerotic (Apoe(-/-)) mice. When placed on a high-fat diet, these double-knockout mice developed atherosclerosis at a much earlier time point compared with that their Apoe(-/-) counterparts, eventually demonstrating an 84% increase in total plaque burden. Moreover, these animals exhibited extensive development of EndMT, deposition of fibronectin, and increased neointima formation. Additionally, we conducted a molecular and morphometric examination of left main coronary arteries from 43 patients with various levels of coronary disease to assess the clinical relevance of these findings. The extent of coronary atherosclerosis in this patient set strongly correlated with loss of endothelial FGFR1 expression, activation of endothelial TGF-â signaling, and the extent of EndMT. These data demonstrate a link between loss of protective endothelial FGFR signaling, development of EndMT, and progression of atherosclerosis.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apolipoproteins E', 'Coronary Artery Disease', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta']",26517696,"[['D12.644.360.024', 'D12.776.157.057', 'D12.776.476.024'], ['B01.050'], ['D10.532.091.500', 'D12.776.070.400.500', 'D12.776.521.120.500'], ['C14.280.647.250.260', 'C14.907.137.126.339', 'C14.907.585.250.260'], ['A11.436.275.682'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.543'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.177', 'D12.776.543.750.630.440', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.370.500'], ['D12.644.276.374.687', 'D12.644.276.954.775', 'D12.776.467.374.687', 'D12.776.467.942.775', 'D23.529.374.687', 'D23.529.942.775']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3937,Rapid determination of trans-resveratrol in red wine by solid-phase microextraction with on-fiber derivatization and multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.,"There has been considerable public interest and a growing number of scientific studies linking certain phenolic compounds in grapes and wines, particularly trans-resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene, TRA), to human health benefits. Typical TRA concentrations in wine are very low. It is a polar compound with very low volatility, which makes it difficult to extract and to separate on a gas chromatography (GC) column without derivatization. In this study, a new method for trace analysis of TRA was developed using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) with on-fiber silylation derivatization. Multidimensional GC equipped with a heartcut valve and cryogenic focusing was coupled with a mass-selective detector and used for improved separations and analysis. The effects of SPME fiber selection, extraction time, temperature, and desorption time were investigated. The derivatization conditions, time/temperature and the volume of derivatization reagent were also optimized. The calibration curve was linear over the concentration range from 10 ng L(-1) to 5 mg L(-1), with a correlation coefficient of 0.9996. The average recovery of TRA in red wine was 83.6+/-5.6%. The method detection limit (MDL) for TRA in ethanol:water (12.5:87.5, v/v) solution in this study was 7.08 ng L(-1) whereas the MDL for TRA in pure water was 2.85 ng L(-1). The new method was used to test the TRA content in six selected Iowa red wine samples. Measured concentrations varied from 12.72 to 851.9 microg L(-1).","['Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Linear Models', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Resveratrol', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Stilbenes', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Wine']",19081100,"[['E05.196.181.349.500', 'E05.196.566.500'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.150.700.725.875', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.715.500'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E05.196.155.800.500'], ['G02.607.445.682'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.150.700'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857'], ['G07.203.100.100.900', 'G07.203.200.887', 'J02.200.100.900', 'J02.350.887']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
41807,Cleaved-tau: a biomarker of neuronal damage after traumatic brain injury.,"Previous studies from our laboratory indicate that traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans results in proteolysis of neuronally-localized, intracellular microtubule associated protein (MAP)-tau to produce cleaved tau (C-tau). The present study evaluated the utility of C-tau to function as a biomarker of neuronal injury and as a biomarker for evaluating neuroprotectant drug efficacy in a controlled cortical impact model of rat TBI. Brain C-tau was determined in rats subjected to controlled cortical impact-induced mild, moderate or severe levels of TBI. A significant severity-dependent increase in C-tau levels was observed in the cortex and hippocampus (1.5-8-fold) of TBI rats compared to shams 72 h after impact. C-tau rat brain and serum time course was determined by measuring levels at 0.25, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 168 h after TBI. A significant time-dependent increase in C-tau levels was observed in ipsilateral cortex (5-16-fold) and hippocampus (2-40-fold) compared to sham animals. C-tau levels increased as early as 6 h after TBI with peak C-tau levels observed 168 h after injury. Elevated brain C-tau levels were associated with TBI-induced tissue loss, which was histologically determined. The effect of cyclosporin-A (CsA), previously demonstrated to be neuroprotective in rat TBI, on brain C-tau levels was examined. CsA (20 mg/kg i.p., 15 min and 24 h after TBI) significantly attenuated the TBI-induced increase in hippocampal C-tau levels observed in vehicle-treated animals confirming CsA's neuroprotectant effect. CsA treatment also lowered ipsilateral cortical C-tau levels, although it did not reach statistical significance. CsA's neuroprotectant effect was confirmed utilizing histologic measures of TBI-induced tissue loss. In addition, serum C-tau levels were significantly increased 6 h after TBI but not at later time points. These results suggest that C-tau is a reliable, quantitative biomarker for evaluating TBI-induced neuronal injury and a potential biomarker of neuroprotectant drug efficacy in the rat TBI model. Serum data suggests that C-tau levels are dependent both on a compromised blood-brain barrier as well as release of TBI biomarkers from the brain, which has implications for the study of human serum TBI biomarkers.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Brain Damage, Chronic', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cyclosporine', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Male', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Time Factors', 'Trauma Severity Indices', 'tau Proteins']",15665604,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C10.228.140.140'], ['C10.228.140.199', 'C10.900.300.087', 'C26.915.300.200'], ['D04.345.566.235.300', 'D12.644.641.235.300'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.875', 'E05.944', 'N04.452.859.564.800', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.800', 'N06.850.520.308.940.968.875'], ['D12.776.220.600.450.510', 'D12.776.631.560.510']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1703,In vitro inhibition of multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms by xanthone derivatives from mangosteen extract.,"Mangosteen is a xanthone-containing fruit found in Southeast Asia for which health claims include maintaining healthy immune and gastrointestinal systems to slowing the progression of tumor growth and neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have identified multiple xanthones in the pericarp of the mangosteen fruit. The aim of the current study was to assess the drug inhibition potential of mangosteen in vitro as well as the cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes responsible for the metabolism of its individual components. The various xanthone derivatives were found to be both substrates and inhibitors for multiple P450 isoforms. Aqueous extracts of the mangosteen pericarp were analyzed for xanthone content as well as inhibition potency. Finally, in vivo plasma concentrations of alpha-mangostin, the most abundant xanthone derivative found in mangosteen, were predicted using Simcyp and found to be well above their respective in vitro K(i) values for CYP2C8 and CYP2C9.","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Garcinia mangostana', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoenzymes', 'Kinetics', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'NADP', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Extracts', 'Xanthones']",19541824,"[['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D27.505.389.500', 'D27.505.519.389.335'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.625.333.600'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.196.566'], ['A11.284.835.540.541'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.749', 'D08.211.625', 'D13.695.667.138.749', 'D13.695.827.068.749'], ['D26'], ['G05.695'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['D03.633.300.953.852']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

19961,Psychosocial correlates of HIV risk behavior in adolescent girls.,"OBJECTIVE: To present the preintervention data collected for a pilot HIV-prevention randomized controlled trial specifically developed for single, sexually active adolescent girls.DESIGN: Comparative, descriptive design using confidential self-administered questionnaires.SETTING: An urban family planning clinic that provided gynecologic services to adolescents.PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-nine single, sexually active adolescent girls 15 to 19 years of age (44% minority, 34% economically disadvantaged).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In addition to demographics and risk behaviors, the following were assessed: HIV-related information (i.e., knowledge) and motivation to reduce risk (i.e., perceived vulnerability, readiness to change HIV risk behaviors, behavioral intentions, pros and cons of condom use, and confidence in condom use).RESULTS: Assessments revealed limited HIV-related knowledge, ambivalence regarding risk reduction, and considerable risk behaviors. Compared with girls at lower risk for HIV infection (i.e., consistent condom users), those at higher risk (i.e., inconsistent or noncondom-users) were more likely to be White and older and to have better HIV-related knowledge but less motivation to reduce risk (i.e., behavioral intentions to use condoms, condom-use confidence) than girls at lower risk.CONCLUSION: These data document (a) the need for HIV prevention interventions targeted to all sexually active adolescent girls and (b) the importance of including a motivational component in the intervention.","['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Adult', 'Attitude to Health', 'Female', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'New York', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Education', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Single Person', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Women']",12570188,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.145.022'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F01.100.150', 'N05.300.150'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.107.567.875.075.437', 'Z01.107.567.875.350.530', 'Z01.107.567.875.500.530'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F04.096.837.500', 'I02.233.332.749'], ['F01.145.802'], ['F01.829.263.315.500.725', 'I01.240.361.500.725', 'I01.880.853.150.423.500.725', 'M01.785', 'N01.224.361.500.725', 'N01.824.308.500.725'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['M01.975']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
26037,Noninvasive evaluation of corneal viscoelasticity based on displacement in response to acoustic radiation force.,"Noninvasive assessment of corneal mechanical properties in vivo will help to the understanding of the pathogenesis and early diagnosis of ectatic corneal disorders. This study presented a noninvasive method that assesses the corneal biomechanical properties by exciting the cornea with acoustic radiation force and monitoring its displacement using a dual-frequency confocal transducer. A 3.85-MHz pushing element was used to induce localized tissue displacement, and the displacement was detected by the 12.8-MHz detecting elements using pulse-echo methods. Under constant acoustic radiation force, 0the tissue displacement are directly correlated with tissue biomechanical properties, a set of parameters were extracted from local displacement waveform, including relaxation time constant (ô), relative elasticity (RE) and relative viscosity (RV). In order to obtain corneal samples with different mechanical properties, the fresh bovine eyes were performed by collagen cross-linking (CXL). The result indicated that the estimated ô in untreated corneas were statistically significantly different (p<;0.05) from those of treated corneas and the estimation of ô varied significantly with different degrees of CXL. It is possible to develop a non-invasive, effective and efficient method with high spatial resolution.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Collagen', 'Cornea', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Elasticity', 'Elasticity Imaging Techniques', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Viscosity']",29060143,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D05.750.078.280', 'D12.776.860.300.250'], ['A09.371.060.217'], ['D27.720.470.410.210'], ['G01.374.590'], ['E01.370.350.850.270'], ['D27.505.954.444.600', 'D27.505.954.600.710'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600'], ['G02.930']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

22287,"The neuroendocrine response of luteinizing hormone to estrogen administration in heterosexual, homosexual, and transsexual subjects.","The neuroendocrine response of LH to estrogen administration may be related to sexual dimorphism of the brain, and therefore, homosexual and especially transsexual individuals may differ from heterosexual individuals in their responses. This study failed to find such differences among groups of female heterosexuals, homosexuals, and transsexuals. Specifically, after single dose estrogen administration, all subjects had an initial decline in serum LH levels, followed by a brisk rise of equal magnitude. Among males, the type of response was less uniform. After an initial fall in serum LH levels, the individual responses varied. In 12 of 23 male homosexuals, 10 of 15 male heterosexuals, and all 6 genetic male transsexuals studied, serum LH levels remained below pretreatment levels. In the remaining 11 male homosexuals and 5 of the heterosexuals, serum LH levels increased to values exceeding those before treatment, resembling the response found in the 3 groups of women. Those homosexual and heterosexual men with a rise in serum LH levels to above pretreatment values also had the greatest fall in testosterone levels after estrogen administration, while these same men had the lowest testosterone response to hCG stimulation. I conclude from these results that 1) the similarity of LH responses to estrogen administration in all groups of women studied does not support a theory of brain androgenization as a factor in the establishment of gender identity of sexual orientation; and 2) individual differences in men in the type of LH response to estrogen administration can be satisfactorily explained by endocrine factors, such as Leydig cell function, and need not be related to gender identity, sexual orientation, or other possible causes.","['Adult', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens, Conjugated (USP)', 'Female', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Homosexuality', 'Humans', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Male', 'Testosterone', 'Transsexualism']",3016021,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D06.472.699.322.326', 'D06.472.699.649.367', 'D12.644.548.726.367', 'D12.776.780.400'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['D06.472.334.851.437.988'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.320', 'D12.644.400.400.740.320', 'D12.644.456.460', 'D12.644.548.365.740.320', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.320'], ['F01.145.802.975.500', 'G08.686.867.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.463', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343.463', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343.463'], ['D04.210.500.054.079.429.824', 'D06.472.334.851.968.984'], ['F01.145.802.975.750']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
39826,Tumor vaccines: effects and fate of IL-2 transfected murine melanoma cells in vivo.,"We have previously demonstrated the general usefulness of the adenovirus-enhanced transferrinfection (AVET) in the generation of IL-2 producing tumor vaccines. By optimizing different parameters of the transfection protocol we were able to transform the poorly immunogenic M-3 mouse melanoma cell line into a potent immunogen. A long-lasting immunity was demonstrated after administration of the IL-2 releasing vaccine, since immunized animals successfully rejected native M-3 melanoma cells even after a period of more than 6 months. We also demonstrated that in vivo administration of such a vaccine is safe since transmission of the transfected IL-2 gene in host organs was not detected. IL-2 production ceased 2 days after injection because the engineered cells were destroyed. However, RT-PCR analysis of the site of vaccine injection suggests that IL-2 exerts its effects not only directly but also by inducing a set of other immunomodulator cytokines in situ that are probably indispensable in inducing a host response. We conclude that AVET of IL-2 into tumor cells is a safe and efficient method for the generation of tumor vaccines.","['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Interleukin-2', 'Male', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Attenuated']",7657408,"[['B04.280.030'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.021', 'D12.644.276.374.480.372', 'D12.776.467.374.465.021', 'D12.776.467.374.480.372', 'D23.529.374.465.155', 'D23.529.374.480.372'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510.525', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510.525', 'C04.557.665.510.525', 'C04.619.600', 'E05.598.500.496.937'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.500'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['A11.251.860'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.530.890', 'E05.478.550.600.890', 'N02.421.726.758.310.890', 'N06.850.780.200.425.900', 'N06.850.780.680.310.890'], ['D20.215.894.811']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
18661,Deletion of GOLGA2P3Y but not GOLGA2P2Y is a risk factor for oligozoospermia.,"The AZFc locus on the human Y chromosome harbours several multicopy genes, some of which are required for spermatogenesis. It is believed that deletion of one or more copies of these genes is a cause of infertility in some men. GOLGA2LY is one of the genes in the AZFc locus and it exists in two copies, GOLGA2P2Y and GOLGA2P3Y. The involvement of GOLGA2LY gene copy deletions in male infertility, however, is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association of deletions of GOLGA2P2Y and GOLGA2P3Y gene copies with male infertility and with sperm concentration and motility. The frequency of GOLGA2P3Y deletion was significantly higher in oligozoospermic men compared with normozoospermic men (7.7% versus 1.2%; P = 0.0001), whereas the frequency of GOLGA2P2Y deletion was comparable between oligozoospermic and normozoospermic men (10.3% versus 11.3%). The deletion of GOLGA2P3Y but not GOLGA2P2Y was significantly higher (P = 0.03) in men with gr/gr rearrangements, indicating that GOLGA2P3Y deletions increase the susceptibility of men with gr/gr rearrangements to oligozoospermia. Furthermore, men with GOLGA2P3Y deletion had reduced sperm concentration and motility compared with men without deletion or with deletion of GOLGA2P2Y. These findings indicate GOLGA2P3Y gene copy may be candidate AZFc gene for male infertility.","['Autoantigens', 'Chromosomes, Human, Y', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Oligospermia', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sperm Count', 'Sperm Motility', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Spermatozoa', 'Temperature']",26655651,"[['D23.050.422'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.505.757', 'A11.284.187.865.983.500', 'G05.360.162.520.300.505.757', 'G05.360.162.865.983.500'], ['G05.365.590.762.320', 'G05.558.800.320'], ['G05.344'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.294.365.700'], ['D12.776.543'], ['C12.294.365.700.508'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['G05.365.590.762', 'G05.558.800'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.870', 'E01.370.225.992.624', 'E05.200.500.195.870', 'E05.200.992.624', 'E05.242.195.870', 'G04.140.870'], ['E01.370.225.992.812', 'E05.200.992.812', 'G04.198.750'], ['G04.152.650.624', 'G08.686.784.310.760'], ['A05.360.490.890', 'A11.497.760'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

All 22 patients were operated on, and the accuracy of the ultrasonic diagnosis was evaluated in comparison to that of palpation diagnosis. Fourteen of 26 testes could be palpated preoperatively and these were all identified ultrasonographically and surgically. Twelve testes could not be palpated. On these 12 testes, surgical exploration revealed 9 testes in the inguinal region and absence of 3 testes. Ultrasound examination predicted its presence in 5 of 9 testes and its absence in all 3 testes. Both sonography and palpation failed to identify their presence in 4 tests. Thus, sensitivity of ultrasound examination was 82.6%, specificity 100% and accuracy 84.6% retrospectively.

960,Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of porcine bacteria that inhibit the growth of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae in vitro.,"AIMS: To identify bacilli, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria that inhibit the growth of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 80 isolates were obtained from various porcine intestinal compartments using selective conditions and grouped into 15 similarity clusters based on whole-cell protein profiles. Random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR patterns identified 24 genotypes. 16S rDNA sequencing assigned all genotypes, except eight aerobes, to established species (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Bifidobacterium thermophilum). According to their minimum inhibitory concentrations, four strains (Ent. faecium, Lact. reuteri, Lact. amylovorus, Bif. thermophilum) were susceptible to all clinically relevant antibiotics. Two lactobacilli showing multiresistance harboured the erm(B) determinant. A cross-section of eight representative strains was examined for growth suppression of two strains of Brach. hyodysenteriae, the aetiological agent of swine dysentery, and compared with intestinal strains derived from other animal sources. The Brachyspira strains were inhibited by strains of Lact. salivarius, Bif. thermophilum, Ent. faecium and B. subtilis.CONCLUSIONS: Three porcine strains of Ent. faecium, Bif. thermophilum and B. subtilis were found to be suitable as probiotic candidates because of their well-established identity, antibiotic susceptibility and antagonistic activity.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: For the first time, antagonistic activity of well-characterized porcine strains against Brach. hyodysenteriae is presented.

39722,Effects of the submarine environment on renal-stone risk factors and vitamin D metabolism.,"The effects of total sunlight deprivation on urinary risk factors for nephrolithiasis and vitamin D metabolism were studied in 20 healthy male subjects. Blood and 24-h urine samples were collected before submarine deployment and 68 days later while still at sea. No subject received sunlight exposure during the test interval. Significant decreases in daily urinary excretion of calcium, uric acid, sodium, sulfate, and phosphorus were found. The relative supersaturation ratio of monosodium urate also fell. There was no change in urinary citrate or urine volume. Mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] declined from 31 to 19 pg/ml (P < 0.0001), parathyroid hormone increased from 22 to 30 pg/ml (P < 0.0001), and osteocalcin (GLA) increased from 2.7 to 3.3 ng/ml (P = 0.005). Mean serum levels of 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D were unchanged. Four subjects had 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng/ml by the end of the submarine patrol. These findings suggest that exposure to the submarine environment produces physiologic changes that decrease the risk for renal stone formation. The data are consistent with the role of vitamin D metabolism in sunlight deprivation and demonstrate that compensatory mechanisms are well established within 68 days.","['Adult', 'Creatinine', 'Diving', 'Humans', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Male', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Phosphorus', 'Risk Factors', 'Sodium', 'Sulfates', 'Vitamin D']",7633276,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['I03.450.642.845.945.500.110', 'N06.230.150.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.777.419.600.500', 'C12.777.967.249.500', 'C12.777.967.500.503', 'C13.351.968.419.600.500', 'C13.351.968.967.249.500', 'C13.351.968.967.500.503', 'C23.300.175.850.550'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['D01.268.666'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['D01.248.497.158.845', 'D01.875.800.800.850'], ['D04.210.500.812.768']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

47534,Dexmedetomidine Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide Induced MCP-1 Expression in Primary Astrocyte.,"Background. Neuroinflammation which presents as a possible mechanism of delirium is associated with MCP-1, an important proinflammatory factor which is expressed on astrocytes. It is known that dexmedetomidine (DEX) possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to investigate the potential effects of DEX on the production of MCP-1 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated astrocytes. Materials and Methods. Astrocytes were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, and 1000 ng/ml), DEX (500 ng/mL), LPS (100 ng/ml), and DEX (10, 100, and 500 ng/mL) for a duration of three hours; expression levels of MCP-1 were measured by real-time PCR. The double immunofluorescence staining protocol was utilized to determine the expression of á2-adrenoceptors (á2AR) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) on astrocytes. Results. Expressions of MCP-1 mRNA in astrocytes were induced dose-dependently by LPS. Administration of DEX significantly inhibited the expression of MCP-1 mRNA (P < 0.001). Double immunofluorescence assay showed that á2AR colocalize with GFAP, which indicates the expression of á2-adrenoceptors in astrocytes. Conclusions. DEX is a potent suppressor of MCP-1 in astrocytes induced with lipopolysaccharide through á2A-adrenergic receptors, which potentially explains its beneficial effects in the treatment of delirium by attenuating neuroinflammation.","['Animals', 'Astrocytes', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2']",28286770,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.637.200', 'A11.650.200'], ['A11.251'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.110.990.600', 'D12.776.467.374.200.110.990.600', 'D23.125.300.110.990.600', 'D23.469.200.110.990.600', 'D23.529.374.200.110.990.500'], ['D03.383.129.308.245'], ['G05.308'], ['D05.750.078.593.400', 'D12.776.220.475.400'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.300.300.300.200', 'D12.776.543.750.695.150.300.300.725', 'D12.776.543.750.720.330.300.300.200']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
22895,Platelet aggregation in dogs after sedation with acepromazine and atropine and during subsequent general anesthesia and surgery.,"Platelet aggregation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release were measured by use of the impedance method in blood samples obtained from 25 adult female Beagles before and after sedation with acepromazine (0.13 mg/kg of body weight) and atropine (0.05 mg/kg), and during general anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced by IV administration of thiamylal (average dosage, 2.1 mg/kg; range, 1.2 to 4.2 mg/kg) and was maintained with halothane in oxygen. Samples of jugular venous blood were obtained from each dog, using citrate as anticoagulant. Platelet count was done on each sample. Platelet aggregation and ATP released from the aggregating platelets were measured within 2.5 hours of sample collection, using a whole-blood aggregometer. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or collagen was used as aggregating agent. For each aggregating agent, platelet aggregation and ATP release were measured over 6 minutes. After sedation with acepromazine and atropine, significant (P < 0.01) reduction was observed in platelet count (from median values of 341,000 cells/microliters to 283,000 cells/microliters) and in the ability of platelets to aggregate in response to ADP (from 14.0 to 7.0 omega). During the same period, maximal release of ATP in response to collagen also was reduced (from 5.56 mumol to 4.57 mumol; P < 0.01); however, this difference ceased to be significant when ATP release was normalized for platelet count. During general anesthesia and surgery (200 minutes after sedation), platelet count and aggregation responses to ADP and collagen had returned to presedation values.

32765,Numerical studies of biocontrol efficacies of foliar plant pathogens in relation to the characteristics of a biocontrol agent.,"A previously published generic mathematic model has been used in a numerical study to understand the dynamics of foliar pathogens in relation to mechanisms, and timing and coverage of biocontrol agent (BCA) applications. With the model parameter values used, it was demonstrated that a BCA possessing either competition or induced resistance as the main mechanism of biological control was more effective in reducing disease development than a BCA with either mycoparasitism or antibiosis as its mechanism. Application coverage, ranging from 50 to 90%, had little effect on biocontrol efficacy, particularly for a BCA with competition and induced resistance as the main mechanism of biocontrol. Conversely, delayed application of BCA had more profound effects on biocontrol efficacy for those with competition or induced resistance as their main mechanism than those with mycoparasitism and antibiosis. Biocontrol efficacy was greatest for a single BCA combining competition with mycoparasitism or antibiosis. The efficacy for a single BCA combining induced resistance with competition critically depended on application time; the efficacy was greatly reduced for delayed applications. The present study suggests that development of an effective strategy for BCA application is critically dependent upon our quantitative understanding of several key biocontrol processes and their interactions. Without reliable quantitative estimation of these processes, it is impossible to make quantitative predictions about biological control and hence to optimize BCA application strategies.","['Antibiosis', 'Models, Biological', 'Plant Diseases']",20626285,"[['G06.550.050', 'G16.062'], ['E05.599.395'], ['G15.610']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
35971,Hospitalization by cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen among older women with stage IV breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Older patients with cancer are at risk for increased side effects of treatment. Our goal was to inform treatment for older patients by analyzing the relationship between chemotherapy regimen and hospitalization among older women receiving palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer.METHOD: We identified women aged 66-99 years with stage IV de novo breast cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2013 who received any of the 10 most common cytotoxic chemotherapy-containing regimens in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. The primary outcome was hospitalization or death within 30 days of starting a new line of chemotherapy. Generalized linear mixed effects models with patient-specific random effects were used for multivariable analysis of the association between chemotherapy regimen and this outcome. Additional covariates included number of prior lines of therapy; time since diagnosis; hormone receptor and HER2 status; sites of metastatic disease; and age, race, and marital status. The unit of analysis was each new line of chemotherapy.RESULTS: Of 972 lines of chemotherapy initiated among 693 patients, 188 (19%) were followed by hospitalization or death within 30 days. After adjustment, there was significant variation in this outcome by chemotherapy regimen (P = .03); compared with capecitabine, hospitalization/death rates were higher with cyclophosphamide + docetaxel (odds ratio [OR], 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-5.59), cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.19-5.03), docetaxel (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.19-5.21), and gemcitabine (OR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.72-7.19).CONCLUSION: Treatment regimen was associated with significant variation in 30-day hospitalization or death among older women receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for stage IV de novo breast cancer.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Capecitabine', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Deoxycytidine', 'Docetaxel', 'Doxorubicin', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Analysis']",30264853,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500.425', 'D03.383.742.698.875.404.425', 'D13.570.230.329.313', 'D13.570.685.245.500.425'], ['D02.455.526.728.650.730.243', 'D02.705.672.500.243'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500', 'D13.570.230.329', 'D13.570.685.245.500'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888.389', 'D02.455.849.291.850.389'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.970.725', 'N04.452.859.819.725', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700.725', 'N06.850.520.308.970.725'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
11473,Retrospective comparison of management of gastro-enteritis in hospitalised children.,"In Hong Kong, bacterial pathogens, the majority of them Salmonellae, cause approximately one-third of paediatric admissions for diarrhoea. This study retrospectively reviewed inpatient gastro-enteritis management, with particular focus on antibiotic use. Antibiotics are generally recommended for Salmonella gastro-enteritis in infants under 3 months of age but not for older infants and children unless they are so toxic that bacteraemia is suspected. Three groups of children admitted with acute gastro-enteritis were randomly identified from a computerised discharge database. Based on pathological reports held in the case records department, the final groups for analysis were Salmonella (n = 86), rotavirus (n = 55) and non-specified (n = 126). Epi Info version 6 (CDC, Atlanta) was used for data entry and analysis. Compared with a combined rotavirus/non-specified group, the Salmonella group were significantly more likely to have blood (OR 6.1, 95% CI 3.2-11.7, p < 0.0001) and mucus (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.6-8.9, p < 0.0001) in the stool, fever during admission (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-8.4, p = 0.001), more stools per day (median 6.2 vs 4.2, p < 0.0001), a longer stay in hospital (median 3.4 vs 2 days, p < 0.0001) and to be younger (median 7.1 vs 14.6 mths, p < 0.0001). The Salmonella group were more likely to have been given antibiotics (38% vs 15%, OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9-6.9, p < 0.0001) but age did not influence the likelihood that antibiotics would be given.","['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rotavirus Infections', 'Salmonella Infections']",12070952,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C06.405.205'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C01.925.782.791.814'], ['C01.150.252.400.310.821']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
8398,Differences in Osteoimmunological Biomarkers Predictive of Psoriatic Arthritis among a Large Italian Cohort of Psoriatic Patients.,"(1) Background: In literature it is reported that 20-30% of psoriatic patients evolve to psoriatic arthritis over time. Currently, no specific biochemical markers can either predict progression to psoriatic arthritis or response to therapies. This study aimed to identify osteoimmunological markers applicable to clinical practice, giving a quantitative tool for evaluating pathological status and, eventually, to provide prognostic support in diagnosis. (2) Methods: Soluble (serum) bone and cartilage markers were quantified in 50 patients with only psoriasis, 50 psoriatic patients with psoriatic arthritis, and 20 healthy controls by means of multiplex and enzyme-linked immunoassays. (3) Results: Differences in the concentrations of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B- ligand (RANK-L), procollagen type I N propeptide (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx-I), dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and sclerostin (SOST) distinguished healthy controls from psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We found that MMP2, MMP12, MMP13, TIMP2, and TIMP4 distinguished psoriasis from psoriatic arthritis patients undergoing a systemic treatment, with a good diagnostic accuracy (Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) > 0.7). Then, chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) and MMP10 distinguished psoriasis from psoriatic arthritis not undergoing systemic therapy and, in the presence of onychopathy, MMP8 levels were higher in psoriasis than in psoriatic arthritis. However, in these latter cases, the diagnostic accuracy of the identified biomarkers was low (0.5 < AUC < 0.7). (4) Conclusions. By highlighting never exploited differences, the wide osteoimmunological biomarkers panel provides a novel clue to the development of diagnostic paths in psoriasis and psoriasis-associated arthropathic disease.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis, Psoriatic', 'Biomarkers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Psoriasis', 'ROC Curve', 'Young Adult']",31717649,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C05.116.900.853.625.800.424', 'C05.550.114.145', 'C05.550.114.865.800.424', 'C17.800.859.675.175'], ['D23.101'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E01.171'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['C17.800.859.675'], ['E05.318.370.800.750', 'E05.318.740.872.750', 'N05.715.360.325.700.680', 'N06.850.520.445.800.750'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

40825,Expression of acquired immunity to the hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum in hamsters.,"Four experiments are described in which hamsters, initially exposed to primary infection with Ancylostoma ceylanicum, were given a homologous challenge and components of the secondary response were quantified and compared to relevant control groups. The initial establishment of the L3 larvae was not prevented in immunized hamsters but their growth was slowed and virtually all larvae were lost within a week of challenge, when the majority were still at the L4 stage of development. The loss of worms was associated with an accelerated mucosal mastocytosis and increased systemic antibody. Thus acquired immunity to hookworm larvae in this system acted on L3 and L4 stages, thereby preventing larvae from maturing in immunized animals. In contrast to primary infections, immunized hamsters responding to a challenge infection did not lose weight nor did they experience significant anaemia, because of the lack of adult worms. The secondary immune responses therefore prevented manifestation of hookworm disease among immunized-challenged animals.","['Ancylostoma', 'Ancylostomiasis', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Helminth', 'Cricetinae', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'Immunity, Mucosal', 'Immunization', 'Immunization, Secondary', 'Larva', 'Male', 'Mast Cells', 'Weight Gain']",9278943,"[['B01.050.500.500.294.400.968.100.100'], ['C01.610.335.508.700.775.455.154'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.185', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.185', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.185'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['E01.370.225.625.400', 'E05.200.625.400', 'G09.188.370.374'], ['G12.450.573'], ['E02.095.465.425.400', 'E05.478.550', 'N02.421.726.758.310', 'N06.850.780.200.425', 'N06.850.780.680.310'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.485', 'E05.478.550.550'], ['B05.500.500', 'G07.345.500.550.500.500'], ['A11.329.427', 'A15.382.652'], ['C23.888.144.243.926', 'G07.345.249.314.120.200.926']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
38135,A qualitative study of motivations for meditation in anthroposophic practitioners.,"Research on meditation is advancing, but few studies about the motivations of meditators exist. Additionally, many forms and traditions of meditation have yet to be investigated. This study addresses both of these issues by presenting an overview of different forms of motivations found in contemporary Anthroposophic meditation practice. 30 Anthroposophic meditators were interviewed about their meditation experiences. The interviews were examined using thematic analysis. 14 data-driven themes were extracted and organized within a framework consisting of three superordinate theory-driven forms of motivation: External, internal and service. A developmental trajectory running from external and internal to service motivations is indicated. This approach improves upon a scheme developed by Shapiro by including additional types of motivations and being able to differentiate between forms of motivations that are fundamentally different: Self-related (heteronomous and autonomous) motivations and other-related motivations.","['Anthroposophy', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Female', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meditation', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Qualitative Research']",30212522,"[['E02.190.088', 'K01.844.058'], ['F01.100.050', 'N05.300.100'], ['M01.526.485', 'N02.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.190.525.374', 'E02.190.901.455', 'F04.754.137.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['H01.770.644.241.850']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

We found more and stronger conditioned reactions at the side predicted by the conditioned stimulus but only in aware participants. Thus, spatial effects are present in trace eyeblink conditioning and may be differentially conditioned depending on the awareness about the spatial relation between conditioned and unconditioned stimulus.","['Adult', 'Blinking', 'Conditioning, Classical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory, Episodic', 'Young Adult']",28610951,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G11.561.731.127', 'G14.152'], ['F02.463.425.179.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425.540.254'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

48838,[Diabetic retinopathy: twelve-year incidence and progression].,"INTRODUCTION: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) it is the main cause of preventable blindness in productive-age adults. The rate of progression to blindness from DR differs among countries and populations.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to report the incidence and progression of DR after 12 years of follow-up in a cohort (n = 100) of adult patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico, we designed an open population cohort study from April 1992 to July 2004. Main variables studied longitudinally were incidence and progression of DR, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin and associated clinical parameters.RESULTS: Mean age was 54 +/- (SD) 9.2 years and the time since DM2 diagnosis was 9 +/- 6 years. Incidence rates at 3, 6 and 12 years were 23, 48 and 71%, respectively; and for progression were 56, 70 and 74%, respectively. The 12-year proliferative DR incidence and progression were 14.3 and 32%, respectively. Mean fasting blood glucose levels were 193 mg/dL and for glycated hemoglobin 11%. Mortality was 45%, half attributable to acute myocardial infarction.DISCUSSION: Diabetic retinopathy in our population has a high incidence that doubled in 3 years, and has an accelerated progression toward more severe forms. Incidence and progression are higher than that reported in white non-Hispanics. It should be high priority in our country to (a) prevent diabetes mellitus, (b) improve its metabolic control, (c) establish RD diagnostic programs and (d) give appropriate treatment.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Time Factors']",15910698,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E05.245.380', 'E05.318.740.300', 'L01.313.500.750.190.380', 'N05.715.360.750.300', 'N06.850.520.830.300'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['C11.768.257', 'C14.907.320.382', 'C19.246.099.500.382'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['D09.400.430.937', 'D12.776.124.400.405.440', 'D12.776.395.381', 'D12.776.422.316.762.380.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['Z01.107.567.589'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
12074,Locus coeruleus lesions potentiate neurotoxic effects of MPTP in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra.,The observation that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neuronal degeneration suggests that the LC noradrenergic system may be involved in the pathogenesis and natural progression of the destruction of the substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. The relationship of these two systems was examined by injection of subtoxic doses of MPTP into unilateral LC 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned mice. A significant loss of dopaminergic cells was only found in the SN on the side of the LC lesions.

17309,Aspergillosis mycetoma of the maxillary antrum.,"Aspergillus is a fungus, usually found growing as one of the many moulds of fruit, foods and nuts. This paper deals with a ball of fungus growing in the maxillary antrum of an elderly female patient presenting as a radio-opaque expansile mass. In man, aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus flavis have both been incriminated as pathogenic species in the para nasal sinuses. Spores of aspergilli become mixed with dust and can enter the ear, nose and lungs. If conditions are favourable, growth will ensue. Generally aspergillus is believed to be an opportunistic pathogen more commonly found in the chronically ill and debilitated. In recent years, the widespread use of antibiotics, steroids as well as anticancer agents, has resulted in an increase of case reports (Zimmerman, 1955) although this may be due to a greater awareness and reporting (Titche, 1978).","['Aged', 'Aspergillosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Maxillary Sinus', 'Paranasal Sinus Diseases']",6961938,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C01.150.703.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A04.531.621.578'], ['C08.460.692', 'C09.603.692']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
21773,Immunogenicity of dimorphic and C-terminal fragments of Plasmodium falciparum MSP2 formulated with different adjuvants in mice.,"BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum MSP2 is a blood stage protein that is associated with protection against malaria. It was shown that the MSP2 dimorphic (D) and constant (C) regions were well recognized by immune human antibodies, and were characterized by major conserved epitopes in different endemic areas and age groups. These Abs recognized merozoite-derived proteins in WB and IFA. Here, the goal was to determine in mice the immunogenicity of the two allelic MSP2 D and C domains formulated with different adjuvants, for their possible use in future clinical studies.METHOD: Female A/J, C3H, and ICR mice were immunized subcutaneously 3 times at 3-week interval with a mixture of allelic and conserved MSP2 long synthetic peptides formulated with different adjuvants. One week after the third injection, sera from each group were obtained and stored at -20°C for subsequent testing.RESULTS: Both domains of the two MSP2 families are immunogenic and the fine specificity and intensity of the Ab responses are dependent on mouse strains and adjuvants. The major epitopes were restricted to the 20-mer peptide sequences comprising the last 8aa of D and first 12aa of C of the two allelic families and the first 20aa of the C region, this for most strains and adjuvants. Strong immune responses were associated with GLA-SE adjuvant and its combination with other TLR agonists (CpG or GDQ) compared to alhydrogel and Montanide. Further, the elicited Abs were also capable of recognizing Plasmodium-derived MSP2 and inhibiting parasite growth in ADCI.CONCLUSION: The data provide a valuable opportunity to evaluate in mice different adjuvant and antigen formulations of a candidate vaccine containing both MSP2 D and C fragments. The formulations with GLA-SE seem to be a promising option to be compared with the alhydrogel one in human clinical trials.","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Protozoan', 'Antigens, Protozoan', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Glucosides', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Lipid A', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Protozoan Proteins', 'Toll-Like Receptors', 'Vaccines, Synthetic']",26874325,"[['D27.505.696.477.067'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.252', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.252', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.252'], ['D23.050.293'], ['A11.251'], ['E05.478.274', 'E05.601.690.300'], ['D23.050.550'], ['D09.408.348'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['D09.698.718.450.500', 'D10.494.500', 'D23.050.161.616.525.500', 'D23.946.123.329.500.500'], ['D20.215.894.582.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.388', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.388'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.510', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.510'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['A11.118.637.555.652', 'A11.148.580', 'A11.627.624', 'A11.733.547', 'A15.145.229.637.555.652', 'A15.378.316.580', 'A15.382.490.555.652', 'A15.382.670.547', 'A15.382.680.547'], ['B01.043.075.380.611.561'], ['D12.776.820'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.910.500'], ['D12.776.828.868', 'D20.215.894.865', 'D23.050.865']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

3685,[Expression and activation of insulin receptor substrate-1 in endometrial carcinoma].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mRNA, protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in endometrial carcinoma.METHODS: Sixty-three endometrial carcinoma (EC) patients, 21 endometrial atypical hyperplasia (AHE) patients and 22 normal control (NE) entered this study. Their clinical information were collected. Fasting serum C-peptide concentration was measured. Expression of IRS-1 in endometrium was examined by RT-PCR and western blot. Immunoprecipitation was used to measure the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1.RESULTS: C-peptide concentration in EC group was higher than that in NE group [(3.2 +/- 1.1) vs (2.5 +/- 0.7) microg/L, P=0.007]. There were no significant differences in IRS-1 mRNA and protein expression among the three groups. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in EC group [(62 +/- 36) %] was higher than that in AHE and NE groups [(53 +/-34)% and (35 +/- 33)%; P=0.048, 0.002]. IRS-1 activation in AHE group was also higher than normal control (P=0.045). IRS-1 activation in endometrioid carcinoma [(69 +/- 33) %] was higher than that in other histological types [(34 +/- 31)%; t=2.300, P=0.025]. IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly higher in patients with advanced stage, high grade, deep myometrial invasion and pelvic lymph node metastasis. IRS-1 activation in endometrium was positively correlated with fasting serum C-peptide concentration (r=0.491, P=0.001).CONCLUSIONS: There is excessive activation of IRS-1 in endometrial carcinoma and atypical hyperplasia. Activation of IRS-1 in endometrial carcinoma is related with poor clinical-pathologic features and may be a prognostic predictor for this tumor. Over-activation of IRS-1 may be an intermediate event linking the hyperinsulinemia and endometrial carcinoma.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'C-Peptide', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Endometrial Hyperplasia', 'Endometrial Neoplasms', 'Endometrium', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tyrosine']",19035139,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.250', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.250'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C13.351.500.852.228'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.585', 'C13.351.500.852.762.200', 'C13.351.937.418.875.200'], ['A05.360.319.679.490'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.360.024.301', 'D12.776.157.057.045', 'D12.776.476.024.382'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.625'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['D12.125.072.050.875']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
32151,"Polyethylene Glycol Maintenance Treatment for Childhood Functional Constipation: A Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) during maintenance treatment of childhood functional constipation (FC) in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.METHODS: Children (2-16 years) with FC according to the Rome III criteria were randomly assigned to maintenance treatment with PEG or placebo for 24 weeks. Children reporting treatment failure before 24 weeks were switched to conventional treatment. Primary outcome was successful treatment, defined as absence of any Rome III criteria with or without use of medication after 24 weeks.RESULTS: A total of 102 children were included: PEG/placebo: 49/53. At 24 weeks, significantly more patients in the PEG group, compared to the placebo group, were successfully treated (33 [67%] vs 19 [36%] hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) = 3.21 [1.73-5.94]). Significantly fewer children in the PEG group switched to rescue medication (2 [4%] vs 30 [57%], P < 0.001). Time before the change to rescue medication was 13 and 27 days, respectively, for each of the 2 children in the PEG group who required rescue medication. Median time to shift to rescue medication was 27 days (range: 3-64 days) in the placebo group. At 24 weeks after initiation of treatment, 33 children (67%) in the PEG group were successfully treated, compared to 19 children (32%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) = 3.21 [1.73-5.94]). No serious adverse event related to use of the medication was registered.CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance treatment with PEG is significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse of constipation symptoms during long-term maintenance treatment in childhood FC. We therefore recommend that maintenance treatment commence after disimpaction.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Constipation', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prospective Studies', 'Solvents', 'Treatment Outcome']",29952829,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C23.888.821.150'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.509'], ['D02.033.455.250.700', 'D05.750.741', 'D25.720.741', 'J01.637.051.720.741'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D27.720.844'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
2477,Does the Janani Suraksha Yojana cash transfer programme to promote facility births in India ensure skilled birth attendance? A qualitative study of intrapartum care in Madhya Pradesh.,"BACKGROUND: Access to facility delivery in India has significantly increased with the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) cash transfer programme to promote facility births. However, a decline in maternal mortality has only followed secular trends as seen from the beginning of the decade well before the programme began. We, therefore, examined the quality of intrapartum care provided in facilities under the JSY programme to study whether it ensures skilled attendance at birth.DESIGN: 1) Non-participant observations (n=18) of intrapartum care during vaginal deliveries at a representative sample of 11 facilities in Madhya Pradesh to document what happens during intrapartum care. 2) Interviews (n=10) with providers to explore reasons for this care. Thematic framework analysis was used.RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the data: 1) delivery environment is chaotic: delivery rooms were not conducive to safe, women-friendly care provision, and coordination between providers was poor. 2) Staff do not provide skilled care routinely: this emerged from observations that monitoring was limited to assessment of cervical dilatation, lack of readiness to provide key elements of care, and the execution of harmful/unnecessary practices coupled with poor techniques. 3) Dominant staff, passive recipients: staff sometimes threatened, abused, or ignored women during delivery; women were passive and accepted dominance and disrespect. Attendants served as 'go-betweens' patients and providers. The interviews with providers revealed their awareness of the compromised quality of care, but they were constrained by structural problems. Positive practices were also observed, including companionship during childbirth and women mobilising in the early stages of labour.CONCLUSIONS: Our observational study did not suggest an adequate level of skilled birth attendance (SBA). The findings reveal insufficiencies in the health system and organisational structures to provide an 'enabling environment' for SBA. We highlight the need to ensure quality obstetric care prior to increasing coverage of facility births if cash transfer programmes like the JSY are to improve health outcomes.","['Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'India', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Maternal Health Services', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Medical Assistance', 'Parturition', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Program Evaluation', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Health Care']",26160769,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.100.050', 'N05.300.100'], ['G16.500.275', 'N06.230'], ['M01.526.485', 'N02.360'], ['N04.590.374.350', 'N05.300.430'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['E05.318.308.420', 'L01.399.250.520', 'N05.715.360.300.400', 'N06.850.520.308.420'], ['N02.421.143.620', 'N02.421.800.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.500', 'N01.224.935.698.653', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.500', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.500'], ['N03.219.521.346.506.564'], ['G08.686.784.769.490'], ['F01.100.150.750.500', 'F01.145.488.887.500', 'N05.300.150.800.500'], ['E05.337.820', 'N04.761.685', 'N05.715.360.650'], ['H01.770.644.241.850'], ['N04.761', 'N05.715']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1

10168,Field-Applicable Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for Rapid Detection of Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae.,"Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a highly contagious disease caused by Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae that affects goats in Africa and Asia. Current available methods for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma infection, including cultivation, serological assays, and PCR, are time-consuming and require fully equipped stationary laboratories, which make them incompatible with testing in the resource-poor settings that are most relevant to this disease. We report a rapid, specific, and sensitive assay employing isothermal DNA amplification using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for the detection of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae. We developed the assay using a specific target sequence in M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, as found in the genome sequence of the field strain ILRI181 and the type strain F38 and that was further evidenced in 10 field strains from different geographical regions. Detection limits corresponding to 5 ? 10(3) and 5 ? 10(4) cells/ml were obtained using genomic DNA and bacterial culture from M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae strain ILRI181, while no amplification was obtained from 71 related Mycoplasma isolates or from the Acholeplasma or the Pasteurella isolates, demonstrating a high degree of specificity. The assay produces a fluorescent signal within 15 to 20 min and worked well using pleural fluid obtained directly from CCPP-positive animals without prior DNA extraction. We demonstrate that the diagnosis of CCPP can be achieved, with a short sample preparation time and a simple read-out device that can be powered by a car battery, in <45 min in a simulated field setting.","['Animals', 'Goats', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Mycoplasma capricolum', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Pleuropneumonia, Contagious', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Veterinary Medicine']",26085615,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.513'], ['E01.370.225.880', 'E05.200.880', 'E05.393.520'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.553.210'], ['E05.393.620'], ['C01.150.252.400.610.610.717', 'C22.717'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['G01.910.857'], ['H02.956']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
44156,Does multiple-dose charcoal therapy enhance salicylate excretion?,"Multiple-dose charcoal therapy has been shown to increase the excretion of some drugs. This study assesses the effects of this intervention on salicylate excretion in the postabsorptive phase. Ten human volunteers participated in this randomized, controlled, crossover, two-limbed protocol. On two occasions each volunteer ingested 2880 mg of aspirin. During the experimental limb, 25 g of activated charcoal was ingested at 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after drug ingestion. Pharmacokinetic data were derived from serial serum salicylate concentrations, and urinary salicylate excretion was quantified. Treatment effects were 9% and 18%, respectively. Although both are significant, they are clinically modest, making multiple-dose charcoal therapy of questionable value for acute salicylate poisoning. Controlled data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of this therapy are required to validate it as an intervention for this condition.","['Adult', 'Aspirin', 'Charcoal', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Reference Values']",2191636,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595.176'], ['D01.268.150.150'], ['E02.319.283'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.250.250.365.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250.365.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250.365.500'], ['E05.978.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

27039,"Vital Signs: Trends in Human Rabies Deaths and Exposures - United States, 1938-2018.","INTRODUCTION: Each year, rabies causes approximately 59,000 deaths worldwide, including approximately two deaths in the United States. Before 1960, dogs were a common reservoir of rabies in the United States; however, increasingly, species of wildlife (e.g., bats, raccoons) are the main reservoirs. This report characterizes human rabies deaths, summarizes trends in rabies mortality, and highlights current rabies risks in the United States.METHODS: Rabies trends in the United States during 1938-2018 were analyzed using national rabies surveillance data. Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project for 2006-2014 were used to estimate the number of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) visits per 100,000 persons during 2017-2018. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' average sales price data were used to estimate PEP costs.RESULTS: From 1960 to 2018, a total of 125 human rabies cases were reported in the United States; 36 (28%) were attributed to dog bites during international travel. Among the 89 infections acquired in the United States, 62 (70%) were attributed to bats. In 2018, approximately 55,000 persons sought PEP after contact with a potentially rabid animal.CONCLUSIONS AND COMMENTS: In the United States, wildlife rabies, especially in bats, continues to pose a risk to humans. Travelers also might be exposed to canine rabies in countries where the disease is still present; increased awareness of rabies while traveling abroad is needed. Vaccinating pets, avoiding contact with wildlife, and seeking medical care if one is bitten or scratched by an animal are the most effective ways to prevent rabies. Understanding the need for timely administration of PEP to prevent death is critical.","['Animals', 'Bites and Stings', 'Chiroptera', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Internationality', 'Mortality', 'Population Surveillance', 'Post-Exposure Prophylaxis', 'Rabies', 'Risk Factors', 'Travel-Related Illness', 'United States']",31194721,"[['B01.050'], ['C25.723.127', 'C26.176'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.937'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['N06.850.460.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.615'], ['E05.318.308.985.550', 'N01.224.935.698', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['N02.421.726.755'], ['C01.925.782.580.830.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C23.888.914', 'I03.883.855'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
39347,Urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase excretion is a marker of tubular cell dysfunction and a predictor of outcome in primary glomerulonephritis.,"BACKGROUND: The urinary excretion of N-acetyl-beta-glucosamynidase (NAG) is increased in subjects exposed to substances toxic for renal tubular cells. In experimental and human glomerular diseases, its increased excretion is probably due to the dysfunction of tubular epithelial cells induced by increased traffic of proteins in the tubular lumen. The first aim of this study was to evaluate whether NAG excretion is correlated not only with the amount of proteinuria but also with some proteinuric components which reflect both glomerular capillary wall damage (IgG) and an impairment of tubular reabsorption of microproteins (alpha(1) microglobulin). The second aim was to assess whether NAG excretion has a predictive value on functional outcome and response to therapy.METHODS: In 136 patients with primary glomerulonephritis [74 with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN), 44 with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and 18 with minimal change disease (MCD)] urinary NAG excretion was measured by a colorimetric method and expressed in units per gram of urinary creatinine.RESULTS: Using univariate linear regression analysis NAG excretion in all 136 patients was significantly dependent on IgG excretion, 24-h proteinuria, fractional excretion of alpha(1) microglobulin (FE alpha(1)m) and diagnosis. Using multiple linear regression analysis, NAG excretion was significantly dependent only on IgG excretion and 24-h proteinuria. Limiting the analysis to 67 patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) and baseline normal renal function, by multiple linear regression, NAG excretion was significantly dependent on IgG excretion (P=0.0004), 24-h proteinuria (P=0.0067) and FE alpha(1)-m (P=0.0032) (R(2)=0.63). In 66 patients with NS and normal baseline renal function (MCD 10 patients; FSGS 20 patients; IMN 36 patients), according to values below or above defined cut-offs (IMN, </= or >18 U/g urinary Cr; FSGS and MCD, </= or >24 U/g urinary Cr), NAG excretion predicted remission in 86 vs 27% of IMN patients (P=0.0002) and 77 vs 14% of FSGS patients (P=0.005). Progression to chronic renal failure (CRF) was 0 vs 47% in IMN patients (P=0.001) and 8 vs 57% in FSGS patients (P=0.03). Using Cox model, in IMN patients only NAG excretion (P=0.01, RR 5.8), but not 24-h proteinuria, predicted progression to CRF. All MCD patients had NAG excretion values below the chosen cut-off, and 90% of them developed remission. Response to immunosuppressive therapy was significantly different in patients with NAG excretion values below or above the cut-offs.CONCLUSION: Urinary NAG excretion can be considered as a reliable marker of the tubulo-toxicity of proteinuria in the early stage of IMN, FSGS and MCD; the excretion values show a significant relationship with 24-h proteinuria, IgG excretion and FE alpha(1)m. Its determination may be a non-invasive, useful test for the early identification of patients who will subsequently develop CRF or clinical remission and responsiveness to therapy.","['Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Female', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Glomerulonephritis, Membranoproliferative', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Tubules', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrosis, Lipoid', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Prognosis', 'Proteinuria', 'Reference Values']",12401843,"[['D08.811.277.450.483.180.500'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D23.101'], ['C12.777.419.570.363', 'C13.351.968.419.570.363'], ['C12.777.419.570.363.615', 'C13.351.968.419.570.363.615', 'C20.425'], ['C12.777.419.570.363.660', 'C13.351.968.419.570.363.640'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A05.810.453'], ['A05.810.453.736.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C12.777.419.630.477', 'C13.351.968.419.630.477'], ['C12.777.419.630.643', 'C13.351.968.419.630.643'], ['E01.789'], ['C12.777.934.734', 'C13.351.968.934.734', 'C23.888.942.750'], ['E05.978.810']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
25460,Effects of exogenous oxytocin and progesterone on GnRH-induced short luteal phases in anoestrous ewes.,"Two experiments investigate the effects of oxytocin and progesterone on premature luteolysis in ewes. In Expt 1, 20 anoestrous ewes were induced to ovulate by multiple injections of GnRH (250 ng i.v. every 2 h for 24 h) followed by a bolus injection of GnRH (125 micrograms, i.v.). Ten ewes received a continuous infusion of oxytocin from the day after the GnRH bolus injection and the other ten ewes were infused with saline. Oxytocin infusion had no significant effect on the proportion of ewes with short luteal phases (P > 0.05). All ewes that had luteal phases of normal duration from either group (n = 9) exhibited a transient increase in plasma concentrations of progesterone 2 h after insertion of the pump. In Expt 2, 25 anoestrous ewes were treated with GnRH as in Expt 1. Five ewes were pretreated with progestagen for 11 days and ten ewes received progesterone (12 mg, i.m.) 24 h after the bolus injection of GnRH. All animals received an oxytocin injection (1 microgram, i.v.) on day 4 after the GnRH bolus. All five ewes that were pretreated with progestagen had normal luteal function and none exhibited a 13, 14-dihydro-15-keto PGF2 alpha (PGFM) response to oxytocin. None of the ten ewes injected with progesterone had a normal luteal phase and six ewes exhibited a PGFM response to oxytocin. Four ewes in the control group had normal luteal function and three had short luteal phases. It is concluded that (1) administration of oxytocin from about the time of ovulation does not prevent premature luteal regression; (2) a transient increase in progesterone at about the time of ovulation is associated with luteal phases of normal duration; (3) a more extended exposure to progesterone at about the time of ovulation prevents normal luteal function and may inhibit luteinization and (4) pretreatment with progesterone prevents luteolysis by reducing the uterine response to oxytocin early in the luteal phase.","['Anestrus', 'Animals', 'Dinoprost', 'Female', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Luteal Phase', 'Oxytocin', 'Progesterone', 'Receptors, Oxytocin', 'Sheep', 'Uterus']",8667346,"[['G08.686.195.249'], ['B01.050'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.400.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.400.200'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.320', 'D12.644.400.400.740.320', 'D12.644.456.460', 'D12.644.548.365.740.320', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.320'], ['G08.686.605.410'], ['D06.472.699.631.692.433', 'D12.644.548.691.692.433'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829', 'D06.472.334.734.623', 'D06.472.334.851.687.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.630', 'D12.776.543.750.720.600.630', 'D12.776.543.750.750.555.630', 'D12.776.543.750.750.660.600'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['A05.360.319.679']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
16167,Do Latin American scientific journals follow dual-use review policies?,"During the past decade, a number of journals have implemented dual-use policies in order to analyze whether the papers submitted for publication could raise concern because of the potential for misuse of their content. In this context, an analysis was performed on Latin American scientific journals to examine whether they apply formal written dual-use review policies and whether they inform their authors and reviewers about potentially sensitive issues in this area, as other international journals do. Peer-reviewed life sciences journals indexed in Latindex from Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile were analyzed. The Guide for Authors and the Instructions to Referees of 216 journals included in the Latindex catalogue (which means that they meet the best quality standards of the Latindex system) were screened for biosecurity-related information using the keywords biosecurity, biological weapons, and dual-use research of concern. Results showed that the screened publications had a total lack of dual-use review policies, even though some of them pointed out ethical behaviors to be followed related to authorship, plagiarism, simultaneous submission, research results misappropriation, ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, guiding principles for the care and use of animals in research, research standard violations, and reviewer bias, among others.","['Biological Science Disciplines', 'Bioterrorism', 'Editorial Policies', 'Latin America', 'Peer Review, Research', 'Periodicals as Topic']",24693885,"[['H01.158'], ['I01.198.240.856.800.100', 'I01.880.735.900.800.100', 'I01.880.735.950.500.226.100'], ['L01.737.484'], ['Z01.107.424'], ['F01.829.316.549.700', 'H01.770.644.487', 'I01.880.604.640.700', 'L01.143.865.750', 'L01.737.640', 'N03.706.700.700'], ['L01.178.682.829.678']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1

Of 586 stroke patients receiving thrombectomy during the past 3 years and registered in the Tama Registry of Acute Endovascular Thrombectomy database, 24 were identified with ICA occlusion (14 extracranial and 10 intracranial), known to be well 6-24 h before presentation, and with pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 or 1. Clinical outcomes measured were the rate of functional independence at 90 days according to mRS score of 0-2 and 90 day mortality rate. Of patients with extracranial ICA occlusion, two received additional carotid stenting with thrombectomy. The median interval between the last time the patient was known to be well and hospital arrival was 601 (interquartile range, 476-729 min). Both the rate of functional independence at 90 days and 90 day mortality were comparable between patients with extracranial or intracranial ICA occlusion (36% vs. 40% and 7% vs. 10%, respectively). No symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages occurred within 24 h following treatment of extracranial ICA occlusion. Thrombectomy performed 6-24 h after extracranial ICA results in acceptable functional outcome. Further clinical study is warranted to better define the temporal window of thrombectomy for acceptable functional outcome in patients with extracranial ICA occlusion.","['Carotid Artery Thrombosis', 'Databases, Factual', 'Endovascular Procedures', 'Registries', 'Stroke', 'Thrombectomy', 'Time-to-Treatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",31281169,"[['C10.228.140.300.200.355', 'C14.907.253.123.355', 'C14.907.253.566.206', 'C14.907.355.590.213.206'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400', 'L01.470.750.750'], ['E04.100.814.529', 'E04.502.382'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855'], ['E04.100.814.842'], ['E02.760.928', 'N02.421.585.928'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

34327,Single-molecule imaging of a three-component ordered actin disassembly mechanism.,"The mechanisms by which cells destabilize and rapidly disassemble filamentous actin networks have remained elusive; however, Coronin, Cofilin and AIP1 have been implicated in this process. Here using multi-wavelength single-molecule fluorescence imaging, we show that mammalian Cor1B, Cof1 and AIP1 work in concert through a temporally ordered pathway to induce highly efficient severing and disassembly of actin filaments. Cor1B binds to filaments first, and dramatically accelerates the subsequent binding of Cof1, leading to heavily decorated, stabilized filaments. Cof1 in turn recruits AIP1, which rapidly triggers severing and remains bound to the newly generated barbed ends. New growth at barbed ends generated by severing was blocked specifically in the presence of all three proteins. This activity enabled us to reconstitute and directly visualize single actin filaments being rapidly polymerized by formins at their barbed ends while simultanteously being stochastically severed and capped along their lengths, and disassembled from their pointed ends.","['Actin Cytoskeleton', 'Animals', 'Cofilin 1', 'Escherichia coli', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Rabbits', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins']",25995115,"[['A11.284.430.214.190.750.050'], ['B01.050'], ['D05.750.078.730.212.500', 'D12.776.220.525.212.500'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D05.750.078.730', 'D12.776.220.525'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['D12.644.360.325.150.500', 'D12.776.476.325.150.500']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33796,Influence of 7á-hydroxycholesterol on sphingomyelin and sphingomyelin/phosphatidylcholine films - The Langmuir monolayer study complemented with theoretical calculations.,"Under pathological conditions, cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) appear in enhanced concentration in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, which leads to cytotoxic effect, especially in central nervous system. However, the mode of action of oxysterols on the membrane level has not been fully resolved. In this paper we have investigated the interaction between 7á- hydroxycholesterol, 7á-OH (one of the most abundant oxysterol in human body) and two major membrane lipids: sphingomyelin, SM (basic component of lipid rafts and nerve membrane) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC (main phospholipid of mammalian cell membranes). 7á-OH/SM mixtures may mimic pathologically changed lipid raft (ordered phase, LO) while the SM/POPC system can model its surrounding (liquid-disordered phase, Lá). For our study, the Langmuir monolayer technique (based on registration of the surface pressure/area, ð/A isotherms), complemented with surface visualization technique (Brewster angle microscopy, BAM) and theoretical calculations, have been employed. The observed affinity of 7á-OH to SM, which appears to be stronger than in cholesterol/SM system, indicates that cholesterol might be partially replaced in lipid rafts by its oxidized derivative. Its incorporation significantly increases rigidity of the system in relation to normal (cholesterol-containing) raft, which can disturb its proper functioning. On the other hand, the poor effect of this oxysterol on the raft's environment was observed.","['Animals', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholesterols', 'Membrane Microdomains', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Models, Chemical', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Sphingomyelins']",30716293,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284.800.500', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197.800.500', 'D10.570.938.208.825.500'], ['A11.284.149.165.570'], ['D25.479', 'J01.637.051.479', 'J01.637.087.500'], ['E05.599.495'], ['D10.570.755.375.760.400.800'], ['D09.400.410.420.525.870', 'D10.390.470.675.870', 'D10.570.755.893', 'D10.570.877.360.612.870']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
24893,Fibromuscular dysplasia unraveled: the pulsation-induced microtrauma and reactive hyperplasia theory.,"INTRODUCTION: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a relatively uncommon, non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic vascular condition of unknown etiology. There have been no major advancements in understanding FMD in the past 30-40yrs. We hypothesize that the vascular changes seen in FMD are a direct result of recurrent mechanical trauma in susceptible vessels and reflect a compensatory response to recurrent pulsation-induced mechanical trauma.METHODS: Radiology records at a large tertiary care medical center were queried for cases of cervical carotid FMD. Cases with viewable sequential angiographic evidence of FMD were selected and analyzed for degree of vessel tortuosity, FMD type, degree of vessel movement, and association with the FMD lesion. Images were independently analyzed by 1 neurologist and 2 neuroradiologists.RESULTS: Twenty-four carotid vessels in fourteen patients were identified to have FMD, 100% of patients were female, average age was 58.43±8.72yrs (range 45-73), 35.7% were black, 35.7% had HTN, 7.14% had CKD and 7.14% used tobacco in the past year. Associated findings included aneurysms and dissections. All but 1 patient had at least mild vessel tortuosity, and 28.6% were moderate or severe. All but 1 patient had at least ""some"" pulsation-like vessel movement, 16.7% had ""significant"" movement, and all movement was focally associated with the FMD abnormality.CONCLUSION: Pulsatile vascular movements were observed in high frequency and in high association with FMD. We propose a theoretical connection between the pulsation-induced movement and a process of reactive vascular hyperplasia and fibrosis responsible for the FMD phenotype and is consistent with previous findings.","['Aged', 'Female', 'Fibromuscular Dysplasia', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Wounds and Injuries']",24810675,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C14.907.137.372'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.599'], ['C26']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
30960,Folinic Acid Increases Protein Arginine Methylation in Human Endothelial Cells.,"Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms underlying this association are not completely understood. Cellular hypomethylation has been suggested to be a key pathophysiologic mechanism, since S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), the Hcy metabolic precursor and a potent inhibitor of methyltransferase activity, accumulates in the setting of hyperhomocysteinemia. In this study, the impact of folate and methionine on intracellular AdoHcy levels and protein arginine methylation status was studied. Human endothelial cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of folinic acid (FnA), a stable precursor of folate, with or without methionine restriction. The levels of intracellular AdoHcy and AdoMet, tHcy in the cell culture medium, and protein-incorporated methylarginines were evaluated by suitable liquid chromatography techniques. FnA supplementation, with or without methionine restriction, reduced the level of tHcy and did not affect intracellular AdoMet levels. Interestingly, FnA supplementation reduced intracellular AdoHcy levels only in cells grown under methionine restriction. Furthermore, these cells also displayed increased protein arginine methylation status. These observations suggest that folic acid supplementation may enhance cellular methylation capacity under a low methionine status. Our results lead us to hypothesize that the putative benefits of folic acid supplementation in restoring endothelial homeostasis, thus preventing atherothrombotic events, should be reevaluated in subjects under a methionine restriction diet.","['Arginine', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Homocysteine', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin', 'Methionine', 'Methylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine']",29587354,"[['D12.125.068.050', 'D12.125.095.104', 'D12.125.142.087'], ['A11.251'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D02.886.030.498', 'D12.125.166.498'], ['A11.436.275.682'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.400.800.350.450', 'D08.211.840.300.500'], ['D02.886.030.676', 'D12.125.142.557', 'D12.125.154.549', 'D12.125.166.676'], ['G02.111.035.538', 'G02.607.094.538', 'G03.059.538'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600', 'G02.111.691.600', 'G03.734.871.790.600', 'G05.308.670.600'], ['D02.886.030.498.050', 'D03.633.100.759.590.138.240', 'D12.125.166.498.050', 'D13.570.583.138.240', 'D13.570.800.096.262']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27145,Activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression in follicular lymphoma: association between AID expression and ongoing mutation in FL.,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene. AID has been reported to be specifically expressed in the germinal center (GC). Follicular lymphoma (FL) cells are known to be exposed to GC reaction, as characterized by a high degree of SHM with some heterogeneity in terms of intraclonal microheterogeneity and antigen selection. The heterogeneity of SHM pattern in FL intrigued us to investigate the AID expression. AID expression was investigated in 19 FL materials consisting of 15 cases of FL fresh cells and four cell lines. In all, 10 fresh cells and three cell lines expressed AID, but the others did not. SHM was investigated in 12 fresh cells and four cell lines. The ongoing mutation was significantly different between AID-positive and AID-negative FL fresh cells (unpaired Student's t-test, P=0.047). Ongoing mutation was not seen in any of the cell lines. AID expression was associated with the ongoing mutation in FL fresh cells (two-tailed Pearson's coefficient correlation, r=0.899, P=0.01). The switch off of AID expression may start in the B-lineage differentiation stage counterpart of FL after optimizing SHM, indicated by the cessation of the ongoing mutation in AID-negative FL fresh cells.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Lymphoma, Follicular', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",14990977,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['G04.152'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['D08.811.277.151.486.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.541.500.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.797', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.790.651.797', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650.500', 'D12.776.377.715.548.797', 'G02.111.570.060.425'], ['C04.557.386.480.350', 'C15.604.515.569.480.350', 'C20.683.515.761.480.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['G05.558.810', 'G12.500.780'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

An inter-organizational network consisting of a research university, community members, community organizations, media partners, and foundations was formed to develop a community-based intervention designed to provide health promotion and disease prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes and hypertension. In-depth qualitative interviews (n = 18) with foundation executives and project directors, civic organization leadership, community leaders, county epidemiologist, and university partners were conducted. Our study contextualizes a process to build a public health partnership using cultural, community, organizational, and societal factors necessary to address health disparities. Results showed 5 important factors to build organizational capacity: leadership, institutional commitment, trust, credibility, and inter-organizational networks. These factors reflected other important organizational and community capacity indicators such as: community context, organizational policies, practices and structures, and the establishment of new commitments and partnerships important to comprehensively address urban health disparities. Understanding these factors to address African American health disparities will provide lessons learned for health educators, researchers, practitioners, foundations, and communities interested in building and sustaining capacity efforts through the design, implementation, and maintenance of a community-based health promotion intervention.","['African Americans', 'Capacity Building', 'Community Networks', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Organizational Case Studies', 'Pennsylvania', 'Urban Population']",21271434,"[['M01.686.508.100.100', 'M01.686.754.100'], ['N02.138', 'N04.452.105'], ['I01.880.853.500.300', 'L01.313.500.750.300.184', 'N02.421.143.202'], ['I01.240.425.675', 'N01.224.425.437', 'N06.850.505.400.425.675'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.420', 'L01.399.250.520', 'N05.715.360.300.400', 'N06.850.520.308.420'], ['N03.349.380.710', 'N05.715.360.455'], ['Z01.107.567.875.075.550', 'Z01.107.567.875.350.550', 'Z01.107.567.875.500.550'], ['N01.600.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1

25810,Factors Associated With Opioid Use in Patients Hospitalized for Acute Pancreatitis.,"Importance: Limited guidance exists regarding the optimal approach to management of pain in acute pancreatitis (AP).Objectives: To investigate sources of variability in opioid use for treatment of acute pain in patients hospitalized for AP and to explore a potential association of opioid prescribing patterns with length of stay.Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 4307 patients 18 years and older hospitalized for AP in a community-based integrated health care system, from January 1, 2008, to June 30, 2015. Analysis began in November 2017.Exposures: Opioid use was quantified by morphine equivalent dose (MED).Main Outcomes and Measures: Three analyses were performed: (1) factors associated with increased opioid administration during the initial 12 hours of hospitalization (baseline), (2) association of baseline opioid use with length of stay, and (3) frequency of opioid use 90 days after hospital discharge (persistent use).Results: The cohort included 4307 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 57.4 [44.0-70.2] years; 2241 women [52.0%]) with AP. At baseline, 3443 patients (79.9%) received opioids, and 388 patients (9.6%) had persistent opioid use after discharge. After adjusting for pain and other clinical factors, women received less MED than men (adjusted event ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79-0.86; P < .001). Hispanic and Asian patients received less MED than non-Hispanic white patients (adjusted event ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81-0.90; P < .001; and adjusted event ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.86; P < .001, respectively). Alcohol-related AP etiology was associated with increased MED vs gallstone disorders (adjusted event ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18; P < .001). Two of 13 hospitals administered significantly less opioids compared with the others. Median (interquartile range) length of stay was independently associated with MED at baseline, with 3.0 (2.1-4.5) days among patients not receiving opioids vs 5.0 (3.2-8.7) days among patients in the highest quintile of MED (P < .001).Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to pain and disease severity, opioid use varied by etiology of AP, sex, race/ethnicity, and institution of treatment. Increased opioid use at baseline was associated with longer hospitalization. These findings suggest opportunities for improved approaches to pain control for patients with AP.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analgesics, Opioid', 'Cohort Studies', 'Delivery of Health Care, Integrated', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opioid-Related Disorders', 'Pain Management', 'Pancreatitis', 'Patient Discharge', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'United States']",30977846,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D27.505.696.277.600.500', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.760.500', 'D27.505.954.427.040.550.500', 'D27.505.954.427.210.600.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['N04.590.374.142', 'N05.300.262'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C25.775.643.500', 'F03.900.647.500'], ['E02.745', 'N04.590.607.500'], ['C06.689.750'], ['E02.760.169.125', 'E02.760.400.610', 'N02.421.585.169.125', 'N02.421.585.400.610', 'N04.590.233.727.210.125'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
36108,Parity effects on maternal behaviour are not related to circulating oestradiol concentrations in two breeds of sheep.,"Primiparous females of many species, including the sheep, do not show as competent maternal behaviour as multiparous mothers. In this study we investigated whether circulating concentrations of oestradiol might be related to this response, since breed differences in oestradiol concentrations have been shown to correlate with maternal behaviours. Oestradiol concentrations were measured in plasma collected at 2-weekly intervals from primiparous and multiparous ewes of two breeds (Scottish Blackface and Suffolk) throughout gestation, and maternal behaviour was recorded at parturition. Circulating oestradiol concentrations, and the ratio of oestradiol to progesterone concentration (O:P ratio) were higher in late pregnancy in Blackface ewes, but there were no significant effects of ewe parity. However, there was a significant interaction between breed and parity as O:P ratio was lower in primiparous Suffolk ewes compared to multiparous. This relationship was not seen in Blackface ewes. Blackface ewes of both parities groomed their lambs more frequently and made more low-pitched vocalisations than Suffolk ewes. Primiparous ewes were more likely to move as the lamb attempted to suck, and to show withdrawal or aggression towards the lamb. Primiparous Suffolk ewes also made more high pitched bleats than other classes of ewe. The data support previous studies which show an effect of breed on circulating oestradiol and O:P ratio but suggest that parity effects on maternal behaviour may be mediated by sensitivity to circulating concentration of oestradiol rather than variations in the plasma concentrations of this hormone.","['Animals', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Parity', 'Practice, Psychological', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone', 'Sheep', 'Species Specificity']",17884115,"[['B01.050'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['F01.829.263.370.215'], ['G08.686.677', 'G08.686.784.769.472', 'N06.850.490.812.600'], ['F02.463.425.674'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829', 'D06.472.334.734.623', 'D06.472.334.851.687.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['G16.824']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
13130,Combination of PDT and inhibitor treatment affects melanoma cells and spares keratinocytes.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a potential tool in cancer treatment. Today this therapy is established among others for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer. However, the more dangerous skin cancer--the melanoma--still has to be removed by surgery. Therefore, we investigated the effects of PDT and additional administration of heme oxygenase I (HO-I) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors on the treatment of melanoma cells in comparison to nonmalignant keratinocytes. Therefore, cocultures were established with WM451LU melanoma cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. In the coculture some 65% melanoma cells and 35% HaCaT cells were present before PDT, whereas after PDT the proportion was 41% melanoma cells and 59% HaCaT cells. Combination of both inhibitors improves these results to only 16% melanoma cells and 84% HaCaT cells. PDT is, therefore, a potent skin cancer treatment, which might also be interesting for melanoma treatment. The cytotoxic effects of PDT are largely mediated by ROS. Addition of HO-I and PARP inhibitors could improve the efficiency of photodynamic treatment.","['Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes', 'Light', 'Melanoma', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",21078385,"[['G04.146.954.035'], ['A11.251'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['E02.186'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.410.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.409.500', 'A11.436.397'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510', 'C04.557.665.510'], ['E02.186.500', 'E02.319.685', 'E02.774.722'], ['D27.505.519.389.739', 'D27.505.954.248.692'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.115.690'], ['D01.339.431', 'D01.650.775']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

4451,Molecular basis of increased serum resistance among pulmonary isolates of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae.,"Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), a common commensal of the human pharynx, is also an opportunistic pathogen if it becomes established in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). In comparison to colonizing isolates from the upper airway, LRT isolates, especially those associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have increased resistance to the complement- and antibody-dependent, bactericidal effect of serum. To define the molecular basis of this resistance, mutants constructed in a serum resistant strain using the mariner transposon were screened for loss of survival in normal human serum. The loci required for serum resistance contribute to the structure of the exposed surface of the bacterial outer membrane. These included loci involved in biosynthesis of the oligosaccharide component of lipooligosaccharide (LOS), and vacJ, which functions with an ABC transporter encoded by yrb genes in retrograde trafficking of phospholipids from the outer to inner leaflet of the cell envelope. Mutations in vacJ and yrb genes reduced the stability of the outer membrane and were associated with increased cell surface hyrophobicity and phospholipid content. Loss of serum resistance in vacJ and yrb mutants correlated with increased binding of natural immunoglobulin M in serum as well as anti-oligosaccharide mAbs. Expression of vacJ and the yrb genes was positively correlated with serum resistance among clinical isolates. Our findings suggest that NTHi adapts to inflammation encountered during infection of the LRT by modulation of its outer leaflet through increased expression of vacJ and yrb genes to minimize recognition by bactericidal anti-oligosaccharide antibodies.","['Blood Bactericidal Activity', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Genetic Variation', 'Haemophilus Infections', 'Haemophilus influenzae', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Lung', 'Respiratory Tract Infections']",21253576,"[['G09.188.100', 'G12.450.564.204'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.364.249', 'G05.360.340.358.024.249', 'G05.360.340.358.207.249'], ['G05.365'], ['C01.150.252.400.700.433'], ['B03.440.450.600.450.330', 'B03.660.250.550.290.330'], ['G06.462', 'G16.527.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G12.450.564'], ['A04.411'], ['C01.748', 'C08.730']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
17566,A mutation in GroEL interferes with protein folding by reducing the rate of discharge of sequestered polypeptides.,"GroEL140, a mutant Escherichia coli chaperonin unable to support bacteriophage lambda head assembly, was purified to near homogeneity and compared to wild type GroEL (cpn60). GroEL140 exhibited a 1.5-fold lower ATPase activity relative to the wild type protein. The hydrolysis of ATP by both polypeptides was fully inhibited by an excess of ATP gamma S and partially inhibited by ADP and 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate, suggesting that adenine nucleotides display different affinities for the ATP binding site of chaperonins. GroEL140 was more sensitive to trypsin digestion compared to wild type GroEL indicating that the mutation destabilized the conformation of the mutant. The proteolytic susceptibility of both chaperonins was similarly enhanced upon addition of ATP, ADP or non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, providing evidence (i) of a conformational change in the chaperonin structure which is likely to drive the protein discharge process, and (ii) that hydrolysis of ATP is not required to achieve topological modifications. GroEL140 retained its ability to bind non-native ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rbu-P2-carboxylase), but released bound proteins upon addition of ATP and GroES (cpn 10) 6-7-fold less efficiently compared to GroEL. This functional defect was shown to be related to a suboptimal, but not an absence of, interaction with GroES since (i) GroEL140 and GroES were unable to form a complex isolatable by size exclusion chromatography, and (ii) increasing the incubation time or the concentration of GroES enhanced the amount of refolded Rbu-P2-carboxylase discharged from GroEL140-Rbu-P2-carboxylase binary complexes. Pulse-chase experiments involving a double immunoabsorption technique confirmed that Rbu-P2-carboxylase remained associated two times longer with GroEL140 than with GroEL in vivo.","['Adenine Nucleotides', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Chaperonin 60', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Escherichia coli', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Conformation', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase', 'Trypsin']",1350786,"[['D03.633.100.759.646.138', 'D13.695.667.138', 'D13.695.827.068'], ['D08.811.277.040.025'], ['D12.776.097'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.142.500.500', 'D12.776.580.216.210.590.750'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D12.776.580.216'], ['G02.380'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G05.360.600'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['D08.811.520.224.125.800', 'D12.776.765.199.499'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.895', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.895']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

20078,"A C-type lectin could selectively facilitate bacteria clearance in red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii.","C-type lectins function as pattern recognition receptors and play important roles in the innate immune system of crustaceans. In this study, we reported a new CTL gene (designated as PcLec5) from red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. PcLec5 was mainly distributed in hepatopancreas, gills and intestine, and the PcLec5 transcripts were up-regulated in all the three tissues after challenge with bacteria Vibrio anguillarum. For further functional analyses, PcLec5 was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and anti-PcLec5 polyclonal antiserum was prepared. The results of bacteria binding assay revealed that PcLec5 could selectively bind to 5 of 9 kinds of bacteria we used and had a tendency to bind to Gram-negative bacteria. Sugar binding assay showed that PcLec5 could bind to peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide, with the highest affinity to LPS. Furthermore, bacteria-clearance experiment showed PcLec5 could selectively facilitate the clearance of injected bacteria in crayfish, and the bacteria-clearance facilitating spectrum of PcLec5 was totally in agreement with its bacteria binding spectrum. These results suggested PcLec5 function as a pattern recognition receptor in crayfish immune system and had certain selectivity on bacteria pathogens.","['Animals', 'Astacoidea', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gills', 'Hepatopancreas', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Species Specificity', 'Teichoic Acids', 'Vibrio']",23989040,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.131.365.190.070'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['H01.158.273.180', 'L01.313.124'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G05.308'], ['A13.421'], ['A13.463'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['D12.776.503.280'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D09.400.420.700', 'D09.698.718.594', 'D12.644.233.594', 'D12.776.395.560.800', 'D23.050.161.616.594'], ['E05.393.620.500.706'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['G16.824'], ['D09.408.872', 'D09.698.718.825', 'D09.894.847', 'D23.050.161.616.797'], ['B03.440.450.900.859', 'B03.660.250.830.830']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
7977,Deregulated MHC class II transactivator expression leads to a strong Th2 bias in CD4+ T lymphocytes.,"The MHC class II (MHC-II) transactivator (CIITA) is the master transcriptional regulator of genes involved in MHC-II-restricted Ag presentation. Fine tuning of CIITA gene expression determines the cell type-specific expression of MHC-II genes. This regulation is achieved by the selective usage of multiple CIITA promoters. It has recently been suggested that CIITA also contributes to Th cell differentiation by suppressing IL-4 expression in Th1 cells. In this study, we show that endogenous CIITA is expressed at low levels in activated mouse T cells. Importantly CIITA is not regulated differentially in murine and human Th1 and Th2 cells. Ectopic expression of a CIITA transgene in multiple mouse cell types including T cells, does not interfere with normal development of CD4(+) T cells. However, upon TCR activation the CIITA transgenic CD4(+) T cells preferentially differentiate into IL-4-secreting Th2-type cells. These results imply that CIITA is not a direct Th1-specific repressor of the IL-4 gene and that tight control over the expression of CIITA and MHC-II is required to maintain the normal balance between Th1 and Th2 responses.","['Adult', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Species Specificity', 'Th1 Cells', 'Th2 Cells', 'Trans-Activators']",12538670,"[['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200'], ['G04.152'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['G05.308'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.610.600', 'G05.360.340.024.380.500.600', 'G12.500.500.600'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.440', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.440'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['D12.776.660'], ['G16.824'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.550.500.400.900', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.200.400.900', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.500.400.900', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.500.400.500', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200.400.500', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.500.400.500', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.500.400.900', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200.400.900', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.500.400.900'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.550.500.400.905', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.200.400.905', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.500.400.905', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.500.400.750', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200.400.750', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.500.400.750', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.500.400.905', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200.400.905', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.500.400.905'], ['D12.776.260.755', 'D12.776.930.900', 'D12.776.964.925.984']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
25946,Preparation of dendrimer SAM on Au substrate and adsorption/desorption of poly-L-glutamate on the SAM.,"A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of a dendrimer has been fabricated by covalent bonding of amine-terminated dendrimers to 3-mercaptopropionic acid SAM on an Au substrate, where an amide bond was formed between the amine and the carboxylic acid using amide-coupling reagents. Each reaction step was inspected by transmission surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. Reaction was affected by solvents of the coupling reagents and concentrations of the coupling reagents and dendrimers. The pH-dependent adsorption/desorption behavior of sodium poly-L-glutamate (PGA) has been examined on the dendrimer SAM prepared. The adsorbed amount was abundant at acid pH below the pK(a) of carboxylate, while desorption from PGA-adsorbed dendrimer SAM prepared at acid pH proceeded as the pH was raised. The reaction was reversible and reproducible within 30 min under controlled pH, although the carboxylic acid species adsorbed at pH 4.2 was deprotonated to a carboxylate species after more than 30 min of desorption at pH 9.4.","['Adsorption', 'Amides', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Electrochemistry', 'Glutamates', 'Gold', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Polyglutamic Acid', 'Solvents', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Surface Properties', 'Time Factors']",16108429,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['D02.065'], ['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['D02.241'], ['H01.181.529.307'], ['D12.125.067.625', 'D12.125.119.409'], ['D01.268.556.322', 'D01.268.956.186', 'D01.552.544.322'], ['G02.282'], ['G02.300'], ['D25.479', 'J01.637.051.479', 'J01.637.087.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.580', 'E05.595.402.580'], ['D12.125.067.625.700', 'D12.125.119.409.700', 'D12.644.748'], ['D27.720.844'], ['E05.196.712.726', 'E05.196.867.826'], ['E05.196.712.726.676.700', 'E05.196.867.826.676.700'], ['G02.111.835'], ['G02.860'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
30642,RHCE-D-CE hybrid genes can cause false-negative DNA typing of the Rh e antigen.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: DNA typing of the human Rh blood groups generally shows good agreement with serologically defined phenotypes. However, in the present report we describe four individuals who were declared Rh e negative by genotyping although they express the Rh e antigen.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serotyping was performed using mono- and polyclonal Rh antisera. Fluorescent multiplex sequence-specific polymerase chain reactions (PCR-SSPs) identified RHD exons and the polymorphisms usually associated with the Rh E/e or Rh C/c/C(W) antigens. Additional PCR amplification reactions, which were carried out to reveal RHCE-D-CE hybrid genes, analysed exon 5 of the RH genes, the location of the polymorphism (676C-->G) coding for the Rh E and Rh e antigens.RESULTS: Four individuals were identified who expressed Rh e antigens but were negative by PCR-SSP typing for common Rhe-coding sequences. In one family analysed in detail, an RHCE-D5-CE hybrid gene associated with Rh e antigen expression was identified. A concomitant RHcE allele accounted for a seemingly regular typing pattern by conventional RH PCR.CONCLUSIONS: The presence of RHCE-D5-CE hybrid alleles may cause false-negative DNA-typing results for the Rh e antigen that are easily overlooked unless appropriate RH hybrid PCR-SSPs are incorporated into conventional DNA-typing protocols. These and previous data strongly caution against an uncritical interpretation of RH DNA-typing results.","['Blood Grouping and Crossmatching', 'Epitopes', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genotype', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Pedigree', 'Rh-Hr Blood-Group System']",12366772,"[['E01.370.225.625.120', 'E01.370.225.812.385.120', 'E05.200.625.120', 'E05.200.812.385.120', 'E05.478.594.385.120'], ['D23.050.550'], ['E01.354.340'], ['G05.344'], ['G05.380'], ['D09.400.430', 'D12.776.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.393.673'], ['D23.050.301.290.775', 'D23.050.705.230.775']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45565,Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 modulates immune responses in a gliadin-induced enteropathy animal model.,"Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten proteins (gliadin) that involves innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we hypothesise that the administration of Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347, previously selected for reducing gliadin immunotoxic effects in vitro, could exert protective effects in an animal model of gliadin-induced enteropathy. The effects of this bacterium were evaluated in newborn rats fed gliadin alone or sensitised with interferon (IFN)-ã and fed gliadin. Jejunal tissue sections were collected for histological, NFêB mRNA expression and cytokine production analyses. Leukocyte populations and T-cell subsets were analysed in peripheral blood samples. The possible translocation of the bacterium to different organs was determined by plate counting and the composition of the colonic microbiota was quantified by real-time PCR. Feeding gliadin alone reduced enterocyte height and peripheral CD4+ cells, but increased CD4+/Foxp3+ T and CD8+ cells, while the simultaneous administration of B. longum CECT 7347 exerted opposite effects. Animals sensitised with IFN-ã and fed gliadin showed high cellular infiltration, reduced villi width and enterocyte height. Sensitised animals also exhibited increased NFêB mRNA expression and TNF-á production in tissue sections. B. longum CECT 7347 administration increased NFêB expression and IL-10, but reduced TNF-á, production in the enteropathy model. In sensitised gliadin-fed animals, CD4+, CD4+/Foxp3+ and CD8+ T cells increased, whereas the administration of B. longum CECT 7347 reduced CD4+ and CD4+/Foxp3+ cell populations and increased CD8+ T cell populations. The bifidobacterial strain administered represented between 75-95% of the total bifidobacteria isolated from all treated groups, and translocation to organs was not detected. These findings indicate that B. longum attenuates the production of inflammatory cytokines and the CD4+ T-cell mediated immune response in an animal model of gliadin-induced enteropathy.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Therapy', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cytokines', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gliadin', 'Immunity', 'Inflammation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Rats']",22348021,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['B03.510.024.100', 'B03.510.460.400.400.049.100'], ['E02.095'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200'], ['C06.405.469.637.250', 'C18.452.603.250'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['D12.776.765.433.500.500.400', 'D12.776.765.725.500.500.400'], ['G12.450'], ['C23.550.470'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24932,[Adverse reactions to carcinostatics and countermeasures].,"As adverse reactions to the combination treatment by the digestive system, we observed the occurrence of nausea and vomiting in 15% of the cases who received FTP treatment consisting of 5-FU, toyomicin and prednisone, 25% of the cases who received MFU treatment consisting of MMC, 5-FU and ACNU, and in 64% of the cases who received PPQ treatment consisting of CDDP, Carboquone (CQ) and prednisone. The antiemetics usually used are metoclopramide and droperidol, and we preadminister valproate preparation when persistent and delayed emesis is predicted. Several randomized trials have been made, and good efficacies with drugs such as metoclopramide, domperidone and steroid have been reported. Efficacy was good with acute emesis, but nonexistent with delayed emesis. As to the liver injury, in our combination treatment, only one case showed elevation of GPT by more than 500 units in the cases treated with MFU, while, increase in liver enzymes in the blood was observed in 10-20% of the cases. Similarly, there were not so many cases of liver injury during PPQ treatment. Thus, liver injury due to carcinostatic would be less frequent. Moreover, autopsy revealed hepatocellular-type of liver injury, cholestatic type liver injury and fatty metamorphosis at reasonable incidence. There were no typical cases of veno-occlusive disease which are noticed recently. The most important point for prevention and countermeasures against liver injury is to be careful not to use the previously mentioned drugs exhibiting toxicity in the liver if hepatic disease exists.","['Antiemetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Carbazilquinone', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Chromomycin A3', 'Fluorouracil', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins', 'Nausea', 'Nimustine', 'Organoplatinum Compounds', 'Prednisone', 'Vomiting']",2499262,"[['D27.505.696.663.050.030', 'D27.505.954.427.095', 'D27.505.954.483.200'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D02.806.250.180', 'D03.383.097.217.300'], ['C06.552.100', 'C25.100.562', 'C25.723.260'], ['D09.408.210.209'], ['D03.383.742.698.875.404'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.620'], ['D02.806.400.249.350', 'D03.383.097.500.350', 'D03.633.100.473.412.249.350'], ['D02.806.400.249', 'D03.383.097.500', 'D03.633.100.473.412.249'], ['C23.888.821.712'], ['D02.065.950.594.550', 'D02.654.692.550'], ['D02.691.788'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.719.702'], ['C23.888.821.937']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5990,Association Between Acute Infectious Mononucleosis and Vitamin D Deficiency.,"Epstein-Barr virus and vitamin D both have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, especially multiple sclerosis (MS). Vitamin D influences both innate and adaptive immune responses and has been linked to increased susceptibility to other viral infections such as influenza. Here we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and acute infectious mononucleosis (IM).This study is a case-control study that was conducted on IM patients and a control group of healthy individuals at infectious disease clinics of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Patients were recruited from January to December 2014. The viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM titer and vitamin D levels were measured at the time of acute infection in IM patients. We also measured vitamin D levels in healthy controls recruited during the same period of time. A total number of 60 IM patients with the mean age of 23.26 ± 7.59 and a healthy control group with the mean age of 25.13 ± 6.72 were enrolled. In the IM patients, there was no significant association between 25(OH) D3 levels and VCA IgM titers (r = 0.190, p = 0.146). Mean 25(OH) D3 levels in IM patients were significantly lower than in the control group (15.61 ± 9.72 vs. 21.41 ± 12.64, p = 0.006). Our findings showed significantly lower vitamin D levels in IM patients at the time of infection than in the control group, providing some evidence that the two major risk factors for autoimmune diseases (e.g., MS) might not be independent risk factors.","['Antibodies, Viral', 'Antigens, Viral', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Iran', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D Deficiency']",27505106,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254'], ['D23.050.327'], ['D12.776.964.970.600.550'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['B04.280.210.400.500.450', 'B04.280.382.400.500.400', 'B04.613.204.500.500.400'], ['N02.278.020.300.310', 'N02.278.421.639.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.574', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.574', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.574'], ['C01.925.256.466.313.400', 'C15.378.553.381', 'C15.604.515.516', 'C20.683.515.515'], ['Z01.252.245.500.350'], ['D04.210.500.812.768'], ['C18.654.521.500.133.770']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
33359,Directed evolution of Bacillus subtilis lipase A by use of enantiomeric phosphonate inhibitors: crystal structures and phage display selection.,"Phage display can be used as a protein-engineering tool for the selection of proteins with desirable binding properties from a library of mutants. Here we describe the application of this method for the directed evolution of Bacillus subtilis lipase A, an enzyme that has important properties for the preparation of the pharmaceutically relevant chiral compound 1,2-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol (IPG). PCR mutagenesis with spiked oligonucleotides was employed for saturation mutagenesis of a stretch of amino acids near the active site. After expression of these mutants on bacteriophages, dual selection with (S)-(+)- and (R)-(-)-IPG stereoisomers covalently coupled to enantiomeric phosphonate suicide inhibitors (SIRAN Sc and Rc inhibitors, respectively) was used for the isolation of variants with inverted enantioselectivity. The mutants were further characterised by determination of their Michaelis-Menten parameters. The 3D structures of the Sc and Rc inhibitor-lipase complexes were determined and provided structural insight into the mechanism of enantioselectivity of the enzyme.

2768,Discontinuation of oxytocin in the active phase of labor.,"OBJECTIVE: To show that early discontinuation of oxytocin will not increase the mean duration of the active labor phase in a clinically significant way.DESIGN: Controlled non-inferiority study.SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Caen, Clemenceau Hospital, France.POPULATION: A total of 138 women with singleton pregnancy and a vertex presentation of over 34 gestational weeks, presenting a medical indication of induction of labor or a dystocia at onset of labor, from May 2005 to June 2006.METHODS: Two parallel groups were compared: continuation of oxytocin until delivery versus discontinuation of oxytocin at the onset of the active phase. The clinically acceptable increase in mean duration of the active phase of labor (non-inferiority margin) was set at 60 minutes.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was duration of the active labor phase. Secondary outcome measures included total duration of labor, parameters concerning oxytocin use, rates of uterine hyperstimulation and fetal heart rate (FHR) abnormalities, and mode of delivery. Some neonatal outcomes were also analyzed.RESULTS: Equivalence of the two strategies (continuation vs. discontinuation of oxytocin) was not demonstrated (p=0.97 testing for non-inferiority), the active phase even being significantly longer by a mean of 113 minutes (p=0.0001 testing for superiority). The rates of cesarean sections, alterations of FHR and delivery hemorrhage were higher when oxytocin was continued, but not significantly. There were significantly more infants hospitalized in neonatology when oxytocin was continued (p=0.028).CONCLUSIONS: Discontinuation of oxytocin at the onset of the active phase prolongs labor. We found no argument for discontinuing the infusion of oxytocin at the onset of the active phase.","['Adult', 'Delivery, Obstetric', 'Female', 'Heart Rate, Fetal', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Labor, Induced', 'Labor, Obstetric', 'Oxytocics', 'Oxytocin', 'Pregnancy']",19169930,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E04.520.252'], ['G09.330.380.500.430'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E04.520.252.968'], ['G08.686.784.769.326'], ['D27.505.696.875.737', 'D27.505.954.705.737'], ['D06.472.699.631.692.433', 'D12.644.548.691.692.433'], ['G08.686.784.769']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

2296,Additional Screening and Treatment of Malaria During Pregnancy Provides Further Protection Against Malaria and Nonmalarial Fevers During the First Year of Life.,"Background: Although consensus exists that malaria in pregnancy (MiP) increases the risk of malaria in infancy, and eventually nonmalarial fevers (NMFs), there is a lack of conclusive evidence of benefits of MiP preventive strategies in infants.Methods: In Burkina Faso, a birth cohort study was nested to a clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of a community-based scheduled screening and treatment of malaria in combination with intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (CSST/IPTp-SP) to prevent placental malaria. Clinical episodes and asymptomatic infections were monitored over 1 year of follow-up to compare the effect of CSST/IPTp-SP and standard IPTp-SP on malaria and NMFs.Results: Infants born during low-transmission season from mothers receiving CSST/IPTp-SP had a 26% decreased risk of experiencing a first clinical episode (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% confidence interval, .55-0.99]; P = .047). CSST/IPTp-SP interacted with birth season and gravidity to reduce the incidence of NMFs. No significant effects of CSST/IPTp-SP on the incidence of clinical episodes, parasite density, and Plasmodium falciparum infections were observed.Conclusions: Our findings indicate that CSST/IPTp-SP strategy may provide additional protection against both malaria and NMFs in infants during the first year of life, and suggest that malaria control interventions during pregnancy could have long-term benefits in infants.","['Adult', 'Antimalarials', 'Burkina Faso', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Malaria, Falciparum', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic', 'Pyrimethamine', 'Sulfadoxine']",29659897,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.122.250.100.085'], ['Z01.058.290.190.245'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['D26.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['M01.060.703'], ['C01.610.752.530.650', 'C01.920.875.650'], ['E01.370.500', 'E05.318.308.980.438.580', 'N02.421.726.233.443', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.580', 'N06.850.780.500'], ['B01.043.075.380.611.561'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C01.610.718', 'C13.703.700.680'], ['D03.383.742.675'], ['D02.065.884.725.765', 'D02.092.146.807.765', 'D02.886.590.700.725.765']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
2218,"Successful introduction and audit of a step-down oral antibiotic strategy for low risk paediatric febrile neutropaenia in a UK, multicentre, shared care setting.","PURPOSE: Patients with febrile neutropaenia (FN) can be stratified according to their risk of significant complications, allowing reduced intensity therapy for low risk (LR) episodes. Serious events are very rare in low risk episodes making randomised trials difficult. Introduction of new evidence-based guidelines followed by re-auditing of the outcome is an alternative strategy.METHODS: New guidelines for the management of LR FN were implemented in 4 specialist paediatric oncology centres (POCs) and in their associated shared care units (POSCUs). All patients commenced empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy and after 48h those with blood culture negative episodes designated LR were eligible for discharge on oral co-amoxiclav. Prospective data collection on FN episodes in all treatment centres was undertaken over a 1-year period.RESULTS: Seven hundred and sixty two eligible episodes of FN were recorded in 368 patients; 213 episodes were initiated in POCs and 549 episodes were initiated in POSCUs. In 40% of episodes no clinical or microbiological focus of infection was found. At 48h, 212 (27%) episodes were classified as LR and 143 of these (19%) were managed on the LR protocol. There was a low hospital readmission rate (8/143 episodes; 5.6%), no intensive care admissions and no deaths in LR episodes. Almost all LR episodes (209/212) occurred in the shared care setting.CONCLUSIONS: Rapid step-down to oral antibiotics was a feasible and safe management strategy for LR FN in the shared care setting in England.","['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections', 'Neoplasms', 'Neutropenia', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",19616427,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['M01.060.057'], ['D27.505.954.122'], ['E02.095.147.725.040', 'E04.936.580.040'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['C23.888.119.344'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['C01'], ['C04'], ['C15.378.553.546.184.564'], ['E02.095.147.500.500.500.500', 'E04.936.225.687.500.500'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
36747,The practice of nurse-midwifery in the era of managed care: reports from the field.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to describe the reports of certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) about how changes in the financing and organization of health care in the late 1990s influenced their ability to serve vulnerable populations and provide a woman-centered, prevention-oriented midwifery model of care.METHODS: A 13-page survey was mailed to all CNMs ever certified by the American College of Nurse-Midwives (N = 6365) in July 1998. The survey included closed- and open-ended questions. A total of 2405 CNMs responded: of these, 2089 were in clinical practice during the study period (1997-98) and 82% of the 2089 (N = 1704) wrote responses to the open-ended questions and were included in the qualitative database. We present responses to the closed-ended questions about seven domains of practice and elaborate on three major themes identified through content analysis of the qualitative data.RESULTS: The majority (57%) reported that the changes in the larger health care environment had influenced their practices during 1997-98. The effects most frequently reported were 1) increased client loads (31%); 2) altered style of practice (30%): 3) inability to serve the same populations; (20%); 4) decreased client loads (20%); and 5) increased administrative duties (17%). Three major themes were identified and elaborated upon in the qualitative data: 1) challenges to the style of midwifery practice related to the managed care environment; 2) the loss of socially and economically at-risk women from CNMs' client base; and 3) barriers to high quality and comprehensive services for women.CONCLUSIONS: During the late 1990s as managed care was expanding and health systems were merging, a significant number of CNMs in the field described threats to their ability to sustain economically viable practices and a style of care consistent with the woman-centered, prevention-oriented midwifery model.","['Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Managed Care Programs', 'Maternal Health Services', 'Nurse Midwives', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Pregnancy', 'Professional Practice', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Workload']",12092981,"[['F01.100.050', 'N05.300.100'], ['N04.590.233'], ['E05.318.308.980.344', 'N03.349.380.210', 'N05.425.210', 'N05.715.360.300.800.344', 'N06.850.520.308.980.344'], ['N04.590.374.350', 'N05.300.430'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N03.219.521.576.343.800', 'N04.590.374.410'], ['N02.421.143.620', 'N02.421.800.500'], ['M01.526.485.650.648.762', 'N02.360.650.648.762'], ['N04.590.233.727.407'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['N04.452.758'], ['N04.761', 'N05.715'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['M01.965'], ['I03.946.225.500', 'N04.452.677.650.500']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
39317,Mytilus galloprovincialis fast growing phenotypes under different restrictive feeding conditions: Fast feeders and energy savers.,"The present study aims to test if the environmental conditions prevailing during the growing period can determine the physiological profiles of specimens differentiated as fast (F) or slow (S) growers in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. We reared mussel spats in the laboratory under two different conditions. In Treatment I (continuous feeding during discontinuous immersion), two mussel groups were submitted to a daily air exposure of 8 h and fed continuously during immersion-time, with either high-quality food dosed below the pseudofaeces threshold (BP group) or low organic content food dosed above the pseudofaeces threshold (AP group). In Treatment II (discontinuous feeding during continuous immersion), mussels were continuously immersed but fed only 1 day per week (RC group). Mussels were reared for 7 and 11 months (time required for size-differentiation) in Treatments I and II, respectively, and the smallest and largest individuals from each group were selected as S and F specimens. A series of feeding experiments (with different food quality, food ration and under continuous food supply) were performed to analyse the physiological performance of selected F and S mussels. In Treatment I, no significant differences were found in the metabolic rates between F and S mussels, and the faster growth rate of F-mussels resulted from their capacity to display higher clearance-ingestion rates and pre-ingestive selections. The physiological basis of growth rate differences between F and S mussels were found to be the same in mussels reared with diets below or above a pseudofaeces threshold (FBP, FAP, SBP and SAP). In contrast, the mussels from Treatment II had no significant differences in the feeding rates between FRC and SRC mussels. However, F individuals were found to have a 33% lower standard metabolic rate, indicating that fast growth under severe feeding restriction stemmed from a higher capacity of F-mussels to save energy during long periods of starvation. Despite the differences in the physiological basis explaining fast growth between the two treatments, F-mussels were found to possess significantly higher gill-surface area in both cases. It is thus concluded that endogenous factors affecting the gill-surface area play a major role in determining inter-individual growth rate differences in the mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis.","['Animals', 'Diet', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Mytilus', 'Phenotype']",29907318,"[['B01.050'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['B01.050.500.644.080.537.500'], ['G05.695']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
17582,Gamma delta (ãä) T-cells are critical in the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase at the burn wound site.,"BACKGROUND: The high incidence of morbidity and mortality following major burn can in part be attributed to immune derangements and wound healing complications. Inflammation plays an important role in wound healing, of which inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) derived nitric oxide is a central mediator. T-cells of the ãä TCR lineage have also been shown to be important in healing of the burn wound site. Nonetheless, the role of ãä T-cells in the regulation of the burn wound iNOS expression is unknown.METHODS: Wildtype (WT) and ä TCR(-/-) male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to burn (3rd degree, 12.5% TBSA) or sham treatment. Three days after injury, skin samples from non-injured and the burn wound were collected and analyzed for the expression of iNOS and cytokines and chemokine levels. In a second series of experiments, WT mice were subjected to burn and left untreated or treated with the iNOS inhibitor, L-Nil. Skin cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed 3days thereafter.RESULTS: Burn induced an 18-fold increase in iNOS expression at the wound site as compared to the uninjured skin of WT sham mice. In ä TCR(-/-) mice iNOS expression at the wound site was significantly lower than that of the WT group. Burn also induced increased levels of IL-1â, IL-6, G-CSF, TNF-á, KC, MCP-1, MIP-1á and MIP-1â at the wound site in WT and ä TCR(-/-) mice, but G-CSF, TNF-á, and MIP-1â levels were greater in ä TCR(-/-) mice. Inhibition of iNOS activity in WT mice with L-Nil suppressed burn wound levels of IL-1â, G-CSF, and MIP-1á, whereas IL-6, TNF-á, KC, MCP-1 and MIP-1â were unaffected.CONCLUSIONS: T-cells of the ãä TCR lineage significantly contribute to the up-regulation of iNOS expression which contributes to wound inflammation.","['Animals', 'Burns', 'Chemokines', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'Skin', 'Up-Regulation', 'Wound Healing']",22831879,"[['B01.050'], ['C26.200'], ['D12.644.276.374.200', 'D12.776.467.374.200', 'D23.125.300', 'D23.469.200', 'D23.529.374.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772.500', 'D12.776.157.687.575', 'D12.776.660.720.575'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.816.824.830'], ['A17.815'], ['G02.111.905', 'G05.308.850', 'G07.690.773.998'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
48245,Optimising palliative and end of life care in hospital.,"The acute hospital setting is increasingly regarded as an important area for the delivery of palliative care. A significant number of patients with advanced, life-limiting illness have a range of palliative care needs, some of which can be met by ward staff, but others may require additional, specialist input. Several factors have the potential to limit the palliative care patients in hospital receive, not least of these being disagreement about when and how the transition to palliative care should take place. In practice, however, palliative care can readily be delivered in conjunction with active disease management.","['Education, Nursing, Continuing', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Palliative Care', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Terminal Care', 'United Kingdom']",22848956,"[['I02.358.212.450', 'I02.358.462.399'], ['N02.278.421'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.760.666', 'N02.421.585.666'], ['N04.452.758.849'], ['E02.760.905', 'N02.421.585.905'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

7810,Prevention of rebleeding from oesophageal varices: two-year follow up of a prospective controlled trial of propranolol in addition to sclerotherapy.,"A prospective randomised trial comparing propranolol and sclerotherapy to sclerotherapy alone was conducted over a 2-year follow up in a district hospital setting of unselected patients. Rebleeding and survival were analysed. Thirty-nine patients were randomised to propranolol plus sclerotherapy and 34 to sclerotherapy alone. The two groups were clinically comparable. There was no significant difference in the cumulative percent of patients free of rebleeding; 54% of the sclerotherapy group rebled compared to 52% of the group treated with propranolol plus sclerotherapy (Hazard ratio 1.09 (0.54-2.22) and p = 0.81, NS). Two-year actuarial survival was also not significantly different, with 77% of the propanolol plus sclerotherapy group surviving, compared to 74% of sclerotherapy alone (Hazard ratio 1.08 (0.35-2.22) and p = 0.79, NS). The mean time to eradication of varices was not significantly different between the two groups (propranolol plus sclerotherapy 222 days, sclerotherapy alone 243 days), nor did the rate of variceal recurrence differ (72.7 vs 72 days). This study did not show long-term improvement in rebleeding or survival using propranolol in addition to a regular sclerotherapy programme.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Pressure', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Esophageal and Gastric Varices', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Portal', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Alcoholic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Propranolol', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Sclerotherapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",7963426,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E02.186'], ['C06.405.117.240', 'C06.552.494.414'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.552.494'], ['C06.552.630.380', 'C06.552.645.590', 'C23.550.355.412.380', 'C25.775.100.087.645.550'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.033.100.624.698.711', 'D02.033.755.624.698.711', 'D02.092.063.624.698.711', 'D02.455.426.559.847.638.945', 'D04.615.638.945'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E02.319.805'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
29329,Synaptic vesicle fusion is modulated through feedback inhibition by dopamine auto-receptors.,"Mechanisms of synaptic vesicular fusion and neurotransmitter clearance are highly controlled processes whose finely-tuned regulation is critical for neural function. This modulation has been suggested to involve pre-synaptic auto-receptors; however, their underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. Previous studies with the well-defined C. elegans nervous system have used functional imaging to implicate acid sensing ion channels (ASIC-1) to describe synaptic vesicle fusion dynamics within its eight dopaminergic neurons. Implementing a similar imaging approach with a pH-sensitive fluorescent reporter and fluorescence resonance after photobleaching (FRAP), we analyzed dynamic imaging data collected from individual synaptic termini in live animals. We present evidence that constitutive fusion of neurotransmitter vesicles on dopaminergic synaptic termini is modulated through DOP-2 auto-receptors via a negative feedback loop. Integrating our previous results showing the role of ASIC-1 in a positive feedback loop, we also put forth an updated model for synaptic vesicle fusion in which, along with DAT-1 and ASIC-1, the dopamine auto-receptor DOP-2 lies at a modulatory hub at dopaminergic synapses. Our findings are of potential broader significance as similar mechanisms are likely to be used by auto-receptors for other small molecule neurotransmitters across species.","['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Autoreceptors', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Dopaminergic Neurons', 'Receptors, Dopamine', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles']",31494966,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.136', 'B05.620.136'], ['D12.776.543.750.035', 'D12.776.543.750.720.670.100'], ['B01.050.500.500.294.400.875.660.250.250'], ['A08.675.278', 'A11.671.270'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.300.400', 'D12.776.543.750.695.150.400', 'D12.776.543.750.720.330.400'], ['A08.850', 'A11.284.149.165.420.780'], ['G02.111.820.850', 'G04.835.850', 'G07.265.880', 'G11.561.830'], ['A08.850.840', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.880.830']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

17552,"1,8-Cineol inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-êB p65 and NF-êB-dependent transcriptional activity.","Natural plant-derived products are commonly applied to treat a broad range of human diseases, including cancer as well as chronic and acute airway inflammation. In this regard, the monoterpene oxide 1,8-cineol, the active ingredient of the clinically approved drug Soledum®, is well-established for the therapy of airway diseases, such as chronic sinusitis and bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchial asthma. Although clinical trials underline the beneficial effects of 1,8-cineol in treating inflammatory diseases, the molecular mode of action still remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a 1,8-cineol-depending reduction of NF-êB-activity in human cell lines U373 and HeLa upon stimulation using lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Immunocytochemistry further revealed a reduced nuclear translocation of NF-êB p65, while qPCR and western blot analyses showed strongly attenuated expression of NF-êB target genes. Treatment with 1,8-cineol further led to increased protein levels of IêBá in an IKK-independent matter, while FRET-analyses showed restoring of LPS-associated loss of interaction between NF-êB p65 and IêBá. We likewise observed reduced amounts of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 protein in U373 cells after exposure to 1,8-cineol. In addition, 1,8-cineol led to decreased amount of nuclear NF-êB p65 and reduction of its target gene IêBá at protein level in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our findings suggest a novel mode of action of 1,8-cineol through inhibition of nuclear NF-êB p65 translocation via IêBá resulting in decreased levels of proinflammatory NF-êB target genes and may therefore broaden the field of clinical application of this natural drug for treating inflammatory diseases.","['Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclohexanols', 'Eucalyptol', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'I-kappa B Proteins', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Models, Biological', 'Monoterpenes', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Transcription, Genetic']",23872422,"[['A11.284.430.106', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.117'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['D02.033.415.510.500', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.318', 'D10.289.510.500'], ['D02.033.415.510.500.454', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.318.625', 'D02.455.849.575.250', 'D10.289.510.500.454'], ['G05.308.370'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.435'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.494', 'D12.644.360.361', 'D12.776.476.378'], ['D12.644.360.365', 'D12.776.260.420', 'D12.776.476.381', 'D12.776.930.326'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.374', 'D12.644.360.450.340', 'D12.776.476.450.340'], ['A11.118.637.555', 'A15.145.229.637.555', 'A15.382.490.555'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['D02.455.849.575'], ['D12.644.360.365.500', 'D12.776.260.420.500', 'D12.776.476.381.500', 'D12.776.930.326.500'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G03.143.700'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D12.776.260.600.249', 'D12.776.660.600.249', 'D12.776.930.600.249'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
48950,Ruthenium-106 versus iodine-125 plaque brachytherapy of 571 choroidal melanomas with a thickness of ?5.5 mm.,"BACKGROUND: Episcleral brachytherapy is the most common eye-preserving treatment for medium-sized choroidal melanomas. ã-emitting iodine-125 (125I) and â-emitting ruthenium-106 (106Ru) are widely used. The latter is however generally reserved for thinner tumours (<6 mm). In this study, we compare ocular and patient survival in thicker tumours treated with the respective radioisotope.METHODS: All patients with ?5.5 mm thick choroidal melanomas who were treated with plaque brachytherapy at a single institution between 1 November 1979 and 31 December 2015 were included (n=571). Size-controlled Cox regression HRs for postbrachytherapy enucleation, repeated brachytherapy and melanoma-related mortality were calculated, as well as Kaplan-Meier disease-specific survival and relative 10-year survival in matched subgroups.RESULTS: 317 patients were treated with 106Ru and 254 with 125I. The rate of repeated brachytherapy was significantly higher among patients treated with 106Ru (8%) than with 125I (1%, p<0.001). Size-controlled Cox regression HRs for postbrachytherapy enucleation (125I vs 106Ru 0.7, p=0.083) and melanoma-related mortality were not significant (125I vs 106Ru 1.1, p=0.63). Similarly, Kaplan-Meier disease-specific and relative 10-year survival was comparable in matched groups of 5.5-7.4 mm (relative survival 106Ru 59%, 125I 56%) and ?7.5 mm thick tumours (relative survival 106Ru 46%, 125I 44%).CONCLUSIONS: Rates of repeated brachytherapy were significantly higher among patients treated with 106Ru versus 125I for thick choroidal melanomas. There were, however, no significant differences in rates of enucleation or patient survival.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brachytherapy', 'Choroid Neoplasms', 'Eye Enucleation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ruthenium Radioisotopes', 'Young Adult']",30910871,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E02.815.150'], ['C04.588.364.978.223', 'C11.319.494.198', 'C11.941.160.238', 'C11.941.855.198'], ['E04.540.429'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.268.380.400.500.496', 'D01.496.448.496', 'D01.496.749.474'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510', 'C04.557.665.510'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E02.815.639'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['D01.496.749.745'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
7738,Nature and incidence of bubbles in the spinal cord of decompressed goats.,"The nature of so-called autochthonous bubbles was investigated. Their presence in compressed/decompressed goats was compared with that in animals killed before decompression and in controls. Ten goats (group 1) were subjected to compression/decompression in air. Clinical signs of spinal decompression sickness usually occurred. Within 35 min of surfacing, the animals were given a lethal dose of thiopentone sodium, i.v.. Spinal cords were fixed by immersion in 10% formol saline. Histologically autochthonous bubbles appeared to arise from rupture of over-distended blood vessels. The incidence of grossly dilated empty vessels (GDEV) was recorded. Seven goats (group 2) were similarly compressed but killed before decompression. In five animals of group 1 there was a greater number of GDEV than in controls (group 3, seven animals) but in the other five animals the incidence was similar to the controls. The incidence of GDEV in group 2 was greater than in the controls (P < 0.05). The percentage of sections of spinal cord in which the meninges also contained GDEV was assessed. In all except two animals in group 1, the percentage was higher than in the controls, whereas in group 2 the percentage was higher than in the controls. The experiments show that autochthonous bubbles arise as an artifact and that intravascular bubbles arise in situ.","['Animals', 'Connective Tissue', 'Decompression', 'Decompression Sickness', 'Dilatation, Pathologic', 'Female', 'Goats', 'Male', 'Paralysis', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Diseases', 'Vascular Diseases']",9308143,"[['B01.050'], ['A10.165'], ['E02.278', 'G01.374.715.250'], ['C26.120.248'], ['C23.300.325'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.513'], ['C10.597.622', 'C23.888.592.636'], ['A08.186.854'], ['C10.228.854'], ['C14.907']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

16700,Cannabinoids in exhaled breath following controlled administration of smoked cannabis.,"BACKGROUND: Ä(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THCCOOH), and cannabinol (CBN) were measured in breath following controlled cannabis smoking to characterize the time course and windows of detection of breath cannabinoids.METHODS: Exhaled breath was collected from chronic (?4 times per week) and occasional (<twice per week) smokers before and after smoking a 6.8% THC cigarette. Sample analysis included methanol extraction from breath pads, solid-phase extraction, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantification.RESULTS: THC was the major cannabinoid in breath; no sample contained THCCOOH and only 1 contained CBN. Among chronic smokers (n = 13), all breath samples were positive for THC at 0.89 h, 76.9% at 1.38 h, and 53.8% at 2.38 h, and only 1 sample was positive at 4.2 h after smoking. Among occasional smokers (n = 11), 90.9% of breath samples were THC-positive at 0.95 h and 63.6% at 1.49 h. One occasional smoker had no detectable THC. Analyte recovery from breath pads by methanolic extraction was 84.2%-97.4%. Limits of quantification were 50 pg/pad for THC and CBN and 100 pg/pad for THCCOOH. Solid-phase extraction efficiency was 46.6%-52.1% (THC) and 76.3%-83.8% (THCCOOH, CBN). Matrix effects were -34.6% to 12.3%. Cannabinoids fortified onto breath pads were stable (?18.2% concentration change) for 8 h at room temperature and -20°C storage for 6 months.CONCLUSIONS: Breath may offer an alternative matrix for identifying recent driving under the influence of cannabis, but currently sensitivity is limited to a short detection window (0.5-2 h).","['Adult', 'Breath Tests', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cannabis', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Limit of Detection', 'Male', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Young Adult']",24046200,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.100'], ['D02.455.849.090'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.055.500'], ['E05.196.181.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.872.374', 'N05.715.360.750.725.500', 'N06.850.520.830.872.500'], ['F01.145.610.875', 'F01.145.805.250.500'], ['E05.196.566.880'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
36539,The shape of red blood cells as a function of membrane potential and temperature.,"It is well known that a pH shift of the outside medium from 5 to 9 produces a shape transformation of washed human red blood cells from stomatocytes to echinocytes in isotonic salt solutions. In addition, a stomatocytogenic effect is demonstrated here due to solutions of low ionic strength (below 70 mM). An analysis of the true cell state in these situations, proved by measurements of predicted volume changes, indicates a good correlation between transmembrane potential and cell shape. The fact that amphotericin B acts as echinocytogenic agent in low ionic strength medium at pH 7.4 but not at pH 5.1 underlines this explanation. Therefore, a transmembrane potential positive inside produces stomatocytes, slightly negative inside (below--10 mV), normocytes, and strongly negative, echinocytes. The temperature dependence of this process underlines the rigidity-pattern hypothesis of red blood cell shape (Glaser & Leitmannov?, 1975, 1977).","['Amphotericin B', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Erythrocyte Membrane', 'Erythrocytes', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Temperature']",43897,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
20883,Hypoxia-inducible mammalian gene expression analyzed in vivo at a TATA-driven promoter and at an initiator-driven promoter.,"We have analyzed protein-DNA interactions in vivo at transcriptional control elements for two hypoxia-inducible genes in mouse hepatoma cells. The promoter for the phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) gene contains an initiator element, but no TATA sequence, whereas the promoter for the glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) gene contains a TATA element but no initiator sequence. Our findings reveal hypoxia-inducible, Arnt-dependent occupancy of DNA recognition sites for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) upstream of both target genes. The conserved recognition motif among the five recognition sites is 5'-CGTG-3'. The PGK1 promoter exhibits constitutive occupancy of a binding site for an unknown protein(s); however, we detect no protein-DNA interaction at the initiator element, in either uninduced or induced cells. The Glut1 promoter also exhibits constitutive protein binding; in addition, the TATA element exhibits partial occupancy in uninduced cells and increased occupancy under hypoxic conditions. We find no evidence for hypoxia-induced changes in chromatin structure of either gene. Time-course analyses of the Glut1 gene reveal a temporal relationship between occupancy of HIF-1 sites and TATA element occupancy. Our findings suggest that the promoters for both hypoxia-responsive genes constitutively maintain an accessible chromatin configuration and that HIF-1 facilitates transcription by recruiting and/or stabilizing a transcription factor(s), such as TFIID, at both promoters.","['Animals', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins', 'Phosphoglycerate Kinase', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",9726995,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.157.530.750.100', 'D12.776.260.103.625.500', 'D12.776.543.585.750.100', 'D12.776.930.125.625.500'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['G03.197.300', 'G04.270.300'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.330', 'G05.360.080.689.330', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.249'], ['G05.308.320'], ['G05.308.370'], ['D12.776.157.530.500.500.500', 'D12.776.157.530.937.563.500', 'D12.776.543.585.500.500.500', 'D12.776.543.585.937.625.500'], ['C04.588.274.623.460', 'C04.619.540', 'C06.301.623.460', 'C06.552.697.580', 'E05.598.500.496.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.776.157.530.500', 'D12.776.543.585.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.630.700'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D12.776.260.643.715', 'D12.776.826.209.715', 'D12.776.930.760'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675.850', 'G05.360.080.689.675.850', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680.850'], ['D12.776.930'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
26546,Epidemiology and pathogenesis of ureaplasma urealyticum in spontaneous abortion and early preterm labor.,"The role of U. urealyticum in spontaneous and recurrent spontaneous abortion was studied in 633 women. Cervical colonization with U. urealyticum was found in 42.6% of 310 normal pregnant women, in 41.6% of 84 patients who underwent induced abortion, in 41.5% of 41 normal fertile patients, in 53.3% of 122 patients with spontaneous abortion and in 64.5% of 76 patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion. The cervical isolation rate was significantly higher in patients with spontaneous abortion (p less than 0.05) and recurrent spontaneous abortion (p less than 0.005) than in normal pregnant women. Endometrial colonization was more frequent in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion (27.6%) than in normal fertile women (9.7%) (p less than 0.05). Moreover, in 6 patients with intact membranes and uncontrollable preterm labor resulting in fetal loss (all between the 20th and 28th week of gestation) U. urealyticum was isolated in 5 of them from the cervix, in 4 patients from the placenta and in 2 out of 4 from the amniotic fluid. Histological examination of the placenta showed signs of chorioamnionitis in 5 patients. From this study we conclude that although U. urealyticum is a common inhabitant of the lower genital tract, it may play a role in the etiology of spontaneous abortion and uncontrollable preterm labor.","['Abortion, Spontaneous', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Obstetric Labor, Premature', 'Placenta', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'Ureaplasma']",3321869,"[['C13.703.039', 'G08.686.784.769.496.125'], ['A05.360.319.679.256'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.875', 'E05.200.875'], ['C13.703.420.491'], ['A16.710'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C01.674', 'C13.703.700'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.900']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

24265,Integrated monitoring and information systems for managing aquatic invasive species in a changing climate.,"Changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climatic drivers and sea-level rise will affect populations of existing native and non-native aquatic species and the vulnerability of aquatic environments to new invasions. Monitoring surveys provide the foundation for assessing the combined effects of climate change and invasions by providing baseline biotic and environmental conditions, although the utility of a survey depends on whether the results are quantitative or qualitative, and other design considerations. The results from a variety of monitoring programs in the United States are available in integrated biological information systems, although many include only non-native species, not native species. Besides including natives, we suggest these systems could be improved through the development of standardized methods that capture habitat and physiological requirements and link regional and national biological databases into distributed Web portals that allow drawing information from multiple sources. Combining the outputs from these biological information systems with environmental data would allow the development of ecological-niche models that predict the potential distribution or abundance of native and non-native species on the basis of current environmental conditions. Environmental projections from climate models can be used in these niche models to project changes in species distributions or abundances under altered climatic conditions and to identify potential high-risk invaders. There are, however, a number of challenges, such as uncertainties associated with projections from climate and niche models and difficulty in integrating data with different temporal and spatial granularity. Even with these uncertainties, integration of biological and environmental information systems, niche models, and climate projections would improve management of aquatic ecosystems under the dual threats of biotic invasions and climate change.","['Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Databases, Factual', 'Demography', 'Ecosystem', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Greenhouse Effect', 'Models, Biological', 'Water']",18577087,"[['J01.256', 'N06.230.080'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400', 'L01.470.750.750'], ['I01.240', 'N01.224', 'N06.850.505.400'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['G16.500.175.827', 'N06.230.265'], ['E05.599.395'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0
19850,Characterization of structural variability sheds light on the specificity determinants of the interaction between effector domains and histone tails.,"Structural characterization of the interaction between histone tails and effector modules (bromodomains, chromodomains, PHD fingers, etc.) is fundamental to understand the mechanistic aspects of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In recent years many researchers have applied this approach to specific systems, thus providing a valuable but fragmentary view of the histone-effector interaction. In our work we use this information to characterize the structural features of the two main components of this interaction, histone peptides and the binding site of effector domains (focusing on those which target modified lysines), and increase our knowledge on its specificity determinants. Our results show that the binding sites of effectors are structurally variable, but some clear trends allow their classification in three main groups: flat-groove, narrow-groove and cavity-insertion. In addition, we found that even within these classes binding site variability is substantial. These results in context with the work from other researchers indicate that the there are at least two determinants of binding specificity in the binding site of effector modules. Finally, our analysis of the histone peptides sheds light on the structural transition experienced by histone tails upon effector binding, showing that it may vary depending on the local properties of the sequence stretch considered, thus allowing us to identify an additional specificity determinant for this interaction. Overall, the results of our analysis contribute to clarify the origins of specificity: different regions of the binding site and, in particular, differences in the disorder-order transitions experienced by different histone sequence stretches upon binding.","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Binding Sites', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Peptides', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Software']",20160474,"[['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500', 'G02.111.570.820.709.600.500'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['D12.776.157.687.485', 'D12.776.660.720.485', 'D12.776.664.469'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['E05.599.595'], ['D12.644'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['L01.224.900']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
27910,Conservative management of acute appendicitis.,"BACKGROUND: The acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal emergency, and the primary treatment has been appendicectomy. Antibiotics are started preoperatively and continued postoperatively as needed.METHODS: This prospective study was carried out at Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Srinagar, Kashmir, India to determine the role of antibiotics as the only treatment in acute appendicitis and the analgesic consumption needed. Total of 80 patients were included in the study with a duration of abdominal pain less than 72 h. Out of 80 patients, 40 patients received antibiotics intravenously for 2 days followed by oral treatment for 7 days, while another 40 patients considered as controls were randomized to surgery.RESULTS: Patients managed conservatively were discharged within 3 days except for two--patients who required surgery after 12 and 24 h, respectively, because of peritonitis due to perforated appendicitis. Four patients were readmitted within 1 year as a result of recurrent appendicitis and had to undergo surgery when appendicitis was confirmed. The diagnostic accuracy within the operated group was 90%. Two patients had perforated appendicitis at operation.CONCLUSION: Our conclusion is that antibiotic treatment in the patients with acute appendicitis is quite effective, and these patients may not need surgery. The patients managed conservatively with antibiotics alone experience less pain and require less analgesia but have high recurrent rate.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Appendectomy', 'Appendicitis', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metronidazole', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",19277796,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['E04.210.078'], ['C01.463.099', 'C06.405.205.099', 'C06.405.469.110.207'], ['D03.633.100.810.835.322.186'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.640.672.500', 'D03.383.129.308.658.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E02.887'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

1901,Influence of the endothelium on contractile responses of arteries from diabetic rats.,"Contractile responses of aortas and mesenteric arteries from control and 3 month streptozotocin-diabetic rats to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were compared in the presence and absence of endothelium. In the presence of endothelium, responses of both arteries from diabetic animals to norepinephrine and methoxamine were enhanced compared to control, although no response to clonidine could be detected in arteries from either control or diabetic animals. Following endothelium removal, no significant differences were found between control and diabetic arteries in maximum contractile responses to noradrenaline or methoxamine. However, the sensitivity (pD2) of diabetic aortas to these two agonists was significantly increased, while maximum responses of diabetic aortas and mesenteric arteries to clonidine were much greater than control. In addition, no differences between control and diabetic aortas were detected when cGMP levels were measured in the absence and presence of acetylcholine. These results suggest that enhanced responsiveness of arteries from diabetic animals to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation is not the result of a decrease in endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) release in diabetic blood vessels.","['Acetylcholine', 'Animals', 'Aorta, Thoracic', 'Arteries', 'Clonidine', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mesenteric Arteries', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",2850927,"[['D02.092.211.111'], ['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114.056.372'], ['A07.015.114'], ['D03.383.129.308.436.500'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.454.160', 'D13.695.462.275', 'D13.695.667.454.160', 'D13.695.827.426.160'], ['C18.452.394.750.074', 'C19.246.240', 'E05.598.500.374'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['E05.481'], ['A07.015.114.565'], ['G11.427.494'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
44032,[Nocturnal pulse oximetry diagnosis for screening pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome].,"We evaluated the diagnostic value of pulse oximetry during sleep in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) caused by adenoid-tonsil hypertrophy. Subjects were 22 healthy children free of symptoms such as snoring, sleep apnea and oral breathing and 163 children suspected of OSAS with snoring or sleep apnea. Subjects were measured for percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) during sleep. Of those with suspected OSAS, 69 underwent adenotonsillectomy and were measured for SpO2, both pre- and postoperatively, then pre- and postoperative measurements were compared. After measurement, we analyzed three parameters: lowest saturation (LSpO2), the desaturation index, and total desaturation duration under 95% (TDD95). Few abnormal findings were seen in healthy children. We calculated the mean and standard deviation (SD) of each parameter and set borderlines of mean-2SD for LSpO2 and mean + 2SD for ODI and TDD95. With these borderlines, 105 children for LSpO2, 75 for ODI and 76 for TDD 95 were judged to be normal among the 163 with suspected OSAS. Histograms showed that the mode of each parameter was situated near the borderline. Comparison between pre- and postoperative measurements showed that the effect of the surgery strongly correlated with preoperative measurement in patients undergoing surgery. Assuming that a patient with postoperative improvement is positive, we calculated sensitivity and specificity for each borderline measurement. We found that if success is 100%, the borderline should be 87% for LSpO2, 3.5 for ODI, and 30.0 for TDD95. If success exceeds 90%, the borderline should be 90% for LSpO2, 2.0 for ODI, and 7.0 for TDD95. We therefore conclude that measurement of SpO2 during sleep is useful in screening for pediatric OSAS.","['Adenoidectomy', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oximetry', 'Sleep Apnea, Obstructive', 'Tonsillectomy']",14733119,"[['E04.580.068'], ['M01.060.406'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.100.600', 'E01.370.370.380.600', 'E01.370.386.700.100.600', 'E05.200.124.100.100.600'], ['C08.618.085.852.850', 'C10.886.425.800.750.850'], ['E04.580.848']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
2633,Dietary long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids prevent impaired social behaviour and normalize brain dopamine levels in food allergic mice.,"Allergy is suggested to exacerbate impaired behaviour in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. We have previously shown that food allergy impaired social behaviour in mice. Dietary fatty acid composition may affect both the immune and nervous system. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) on food allergy-induced impaired social behaviour and associated deficits in prefrontal dopamine (DA) in mice. Mice were fed either control or n-3 LCPUFA-enriched diet before and during sensitization with whey. Social behaviour, acute allergic skin response and serum immunoglobulins were assessed. Monoamine levels were measured in brain and intestine and fatty acid content in brain. N-3 LCPUFA prevented impaired social behaviour of allergic mice. Moreover, n-3 LCPUFA supplementation increased docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) incorporation into the brain and restored reduced levels of prefrontal DA and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxytyramine and homovanillic acid in allergic mice. In addition to these brain effects, n-3 LCPUFA supplementation reduced the allergic skin response and restored decreased intestinal levels of serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in allergic mice. N-3 LCPUFA may have beneficial effects on food allergy-induced deficits in social behaviour, either indirectly by reducing the allergic response and restoring intestinal 5-HT signalling, or directly by DHA incorporation into neuronal membranes, affecting the DA system. Therefore, it is of interest to further investigate the relevance of food allergy-enhanced impairments in social behaviour in humans and the potential benefits of dietary n-3 LCPUFA supplementation.","['3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid', 'Animals', 'Brain', 'Chymases', 'Diet', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids', 'Dopamine', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Homovanillic Acid', 'Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Serotonin', 'Skin Physiological Phenomena', 'Social Behavior']",25445491,"[['D02.241.223.601.220'], ['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.103', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.103'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['D10.212.302.380.410.210', 'D10.251.355.337.250', 'D10.627.430.450.375'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['D10.251.355'], ['C20.543.480.370'], ['D02.241.223.601.521'], ['D03.066.288.478', 'D03.633.100.473.404.478'], ['D12.776.124.486.485', 'D12.776.124.790.651', 'D12.776.377.715.548'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.388', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.388'], ['D02.092.211.215.801.852', 'D03.633.100.473.914.814', 'D23.469.050.650'], ['G13.750'], ['F01.145.813']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

49277,Pial arteriolar constriction following cortical spreading depression is mediated by prostanoids.,"The mechanism of pial arteriolar constriction during post-cortical spreading depression (CSD) was examined in anesthetized adult rabbits. Using a closed cranial window and intravital microscopy, the diameter of a pial arteriole was determined. A single CSD was induced by KCl micro-injection and its propagation was monitored by recording slow potential changes accompanying CSD. Prostanoid levels in cortical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were determined by radioimmunoassay. Pial arteriolar diameter increased significantly from 76 +/- 6 to a maximum of 119 +/- 5 microns (57%, n = 8) for 1.6 +/- 0.1 min when CSD (velocity, 2.8 +/- 0.1 mm/min) reached the cortex just beneath the vessel irrespective of its location. Shortly after CSD expiration from the cortex, pial arteriolar diameter decreased from the pre-CSD level to a minimum of 67 +/- 5 microns (12%, n = 8) for 19.5 +/- 2.1 min. CSD was elicited again in the same animal while the cortical surface under the window was continuously superfused with artificial CSF at a flow rate of 3.2-4.5 ml/min. Pial arteriolar dilation (from 75 +/- 6 to 115 +/- 3 microns, 53 +/- 9%, for 1.6 +/- 0.1 min, n = 8) was observed again during CSD (velocity, 2.7 +/- 0.2 mm/min), however, no constriction of the vessel was seen after CSD expiration. Indomethacin pretreatment (n = 11) to inhibit prostanoid production enhanced the magnitude of CSD-induced vasodilation from the pretreatment levels of 59 +/- 9% (from 82 +/- 5 to 130 +/- 8 microns for 1.7 min) to the post-treatment levels of 82 +/- 13% (from 78 +/- 5 to 142 +/- 12 microns for 1.8 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Animals', 'Arterioles', 'Cortical Spreading Depression', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors', 'Indomethacin', 'Muscle Tonus', 'Perfusion', 'Pia Mater', 'Prostaglandins', 'Rabbits', 'Vasoconstriction']",1611512,"[['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114.060', 'A07.015.461.080'], ['G11.561.200.500.300'], ['D27.505.519.389.310', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030.500', 'D27.505.954.329.030.500'], ['D03.633.100.473.420'], ['G11.427.565'], ['E05.680'], ['A08.186.566.731'], ['D10.251.355.255.550', 'D23.469.050.175.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['G09.330.380.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33043,Arthroscopic reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament with use of a quadruple hamstring tendon graft with 3- to 5-year follow-up.,"PURPOSE: This study prospectively evaluated 20 patients treated consecutively to determine patient outcomes, efficacy, and complication potential of arthroscopically assisted posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction performed with hamstring tendon grafts.METHODS: Twenty patients (15 men and 5 women), each with an isolated PCL injury, underwent PCL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autograft and were enrolled in this prospective study. Average age at time of surgery was 29 years (range, 20 to 57 years). Average time from injury to surgery was 4 months (range, 3 to 12 months). Average follow-up period was 40 months (range, 36 to 50 months). Patients underwent regular follow-up after clinical and radiographic preoperative and postoperative evaluation. Follow-up examinations comprised the Lysholm Knee Score, the Tegner Activity Score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, thigh muscle assessment, and radiographic evaluation.RESULTS: Mean preoperative Lysholm score for 20 knees was 63 +/- 10 (range, 48-73); mean postoperative Lysholm score was 93 +/- 9 (range, 77-100). Eighteen of 20 patients (90%) showed good or excellent results at final assessment. Mean preinjury and preoperative Tegner scores were 7 +/- 1.5 (range, 5-9) and 3 +/- 1.9 (range, 2-5), respectively; mean postoperative Tegner score for 20 knees was 6.3 +/- 2.4 (range, 4-9). In final IKDC ratings, 85% of patients (17 of 20) were assessed as normal or near normal (grade A or B). A statistically significant improvement was seen in thigh girth difference, extensor strength ratio, and flexor strength ratio before and after reconstruction at a minimum of 3 years of follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: After follow-up for longer than 36 months, analytical results showed satisfactory function after PCL reconstruction with the use of hamstring tendon autografts. We suggest that the hamstring tendon autograft is a safe, effective, and acceptable choice for PCL reconstruction, and that it affords good ligament reconstruction.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, therapeutic case series.","['Adult', 'Arthroscopy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Knee Joint', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Posterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Range of Motion, Articular', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Recovery of Function', 'Tendons', 'Thigh', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Trauma Severity Indices', 'Treatment Outcome']",16843813,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.388.250.070', 'E04.502.250.070', 'E04.555.113'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.583.475'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['C10.597.613.612', 'C23.300.070.500', 'C23.888.592.608.612'], ['A02.513.514.600', 'A02.835.583.512.600', 'A10.165.669.514.600'], ['E04.614.750', 'N02.421.585.753.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E01.370.600.700', 'G11.427.760'], ['E04.680'], ['G16.757'], ['A02.880'], ['A01.378.610.750'], ['E04.936.664'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.875', 'E05.944', 'N04.452.859.564.800', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.800', 'N06.850.520.308.940.968.875'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
22349,Novel Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Modulates Cardiac Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors and Inflammatory Cytokines in Heart Failure.,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) affects cardiac metabolism and inflammation. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a critical role in cardiac pathophysiology. This study investigated whether HDAC inhibition can regulate HF by modifying cardiac inflammation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms.METHODS: Echocardiography, electrocardiography, ELISA and Western blot were performed in rats with isoproterenol-induced HF, with and without orally administered MPT0E014 (a novel HDAC inhibitor, 50 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days).RESULTS: The left ventricles (LVs) of HF rats expressed significantly higher levels of HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC4 and HDAC6 than the healthy LVs did. HF rats treated with MPT0E014 exhibited improved cardiac fraction shortening with reducing chamber size. The MPT0E014-treated HF LVs exhibited a smaller increase in the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, p22, SMAD2/3, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, PPAR isoforms and circulatory tumor growth factor-â1 than the untreated HF LVs did. Moreover, MPT0E014-treated HF LVs expressed less fibroblast growth factor receptor than untreated HF LVs did.CONCLUSIONS: HDAC inhibition can improve cardiac function and attenuate the effects of HF on cardiac metabolism and inflammation, which might contribute to the beneficial effects of HDAC inhibition in HF.","['Adrenergic beta-Agonists', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines', 'Heart Failure', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases', 'Hydroxamic Acids', 'Indoles', 'Isoenzymes', 'Isoproterenol', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myocarditis', 'Myocardium', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",26304494,"[['D27.505.519.625.050.100.200', 'D27.505.696.577.050.100.200'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.251'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['C14.280.434'], ['A07.541.560'], ['D27.505.519.389.360'], ['D08.811.277.087.520'], ['D02.092.570.394', 'D02.241.511.372'], ['D03.633.100.473'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['D02.033.100.291.439', 'D02.092.063.291.439', 'D02.092.311.649', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.649'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['C14.280.238.625'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['D12.776.826.239', 'D12.776.930.705'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
47069,The role of the premacular liquefied pocket and premacular vitreous cortex in idiopathic macular hole development.,"PURPOSE: To clarify the role of the vitreous in idiopathic macular hole formation.METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the vitreous before and during vitreous surgery in 64 consecutive eyes of 62 patients (stage 1B, four eyes; stage 2, ten eyes; stage 3, 43 eyes; stage 4, four eyes) with macular holes; another three eyes underwent a second vitrectomy. After core vitrectomy, the premacular vitreous cortex was examined by applying gentle suction. The detached posterior hyaloid face was observed under endoilluminiation.RESULTS: We observed in all eyes a liquefied lacuna anterior to the posterior fundus before and during vitreous surgery. The premacular vitreous cortex was extremely thin and elastic upon gentle suction. A premacular ring, the diameter two to four times that of the Weiss ring, was observed in 48 of 57 eyes (84%) with stages 1B, 2, and 3 macular hole. In most cases, the vitreous cortex within the premacular ring either was absent or had a break, resulting in a premacular round defect. The vitreous cortex peripheral to the premacular ring, which was thick and less deformed, never showed a break. In eyes that had undergone a second vitrectomy, we noted residual cortex or an epiretinal membrane around the macular hole.CONCLUSIONS: The premacular vitreous cortex is extremely thin and elastic. It is sharply demarcated by a ring from the thick peripheral vitreous cortex. Tangential traction, which causes macular holes, appears to originate exclusively in the premacular vitreous cortex that forms the posterior wall of the premacular liquefied pocket.","['Eye Diseases', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retinal Perforations', 'Vitrectomy', 'Vitreous Body']",8909201,"[['C11'], ['E01.370.370.050.350', 'E01.370.380.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['C11.768.740'], ['E04.540.960'], ['A09.371.714.500']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
506,Characterization and phosphorylation of CREB-like proteins in Aplysia central nervous system.,"Studies in Aplysia californica indicate that cAMP-mediated gene expression is necessary for long-term facilitation, a correlate of long-term memory. It has been shown that blocking the expression of cAMP-inducible genes in sensory neurons impedes long-term facilitation without any effect on short-term facilitation. Specifically, blocking the binding of CREB-like proteins or inhibiting the expression of a cAMP-inducible gene, C[symbon: see text]EBP, impairs long-term facilitation. In this report, we show the presence of a family of CREB-like proteins in Aplysia CNS that specifically bind to the CRE sequence and cross-react with rat CREB antibodies. Similar to mammalian CREB proteins, Aplysia homologues interact with each other via leucine zipper domains. This interaction can be disrupted by peptides containing the CREB leucine zipper sequence. We demonstrate that a 43 kDa CREB-like protein present in CNS extracts can be phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Moreover, exposure of ganglia to serotonin (5-HT), a transmitter involved in long-term facilitation, increases the phosphorylation of this protein.

21135,A prospective study of XELOX plus bevacizumab as first-line therapy in Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (KSCC 0902).,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XELOX plus bevacizumab in a Japanese metastatic colorectal cancer population that included elderly patients.METHODS: This was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label prospective study. The major inclusion criteria were previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, presence of measurable lesions, age ? 20 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and adequate organ function. Patients received bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg on day 1) and XELOX (130 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin on day 1 plus 1,000 mg/m(2) capecitabine b.i.d. on days 1-14) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate.RESULTS: The study included 47 patients (male/female 30/17; median age 69 years; age range 38-81 years with 10 patients ? 75 years; PS 0/1/2, 40/5/2) enrolled between May 2010 and March 2011. Responses were assessed in 46 eligible patients. The objective response rate was 52.2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 37.0-67.1). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 10.0 months (95 % CI 7.8-12.3) and 34.6 months (95 % CI 19.9-not estimable), respectively. Frequently encountered grade 3 and 4 adverse events in this study were aspartate aminotransferase elevation (23.4 %), alanine aminotransferase elevation (21.3 %), anorexia (12.8 %), neutropenia (10.6 %), fatigue (8.5 %) and anemia (6.4 %). Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy was not observed.CONCLUSION: First-line treatment with XELOX plus bevacizumab showed a promising response rate and an acceptable tolerability profile in the clinical practice of Japanese metastatic colorectal cancer patients that included elderly patients.REGISTRY: UMIN-CTR, ID number: UMIN000003915, URL:https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr.cgi?function=brows&action=brows&type=summary&recptno=R000004706&language=E.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia', 'Anorexia', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bevacizumab', 'Capecitabine', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Deoxycytidine', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia', 'Organoplatinum Compounds', 'Oxaliplatin', 'Oxaloacetates', 'Prospective Studies']",26338269,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C15.378.071'], ['C23.888.821.108'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.060.375', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.060.438', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.200.438'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500.425', 'D03.383.742.698.875.404.425', 'D13.570.230.329.313', 'D13.570.685.245.500.425'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500', 'D13.570.230.329', 'D13.570.685.245.500'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['C23.888.369'], ['D03.383.742.698.875.404'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C15.378.553.546.184.564'], ['D02.691.788'], ['D02.257.750'], ['D02.241.081.337.593.812', 'D02.241.755.648'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
17616,A Stochastic Model for Predicting Age and Mass at Maturity of Insects.,"Variation in age and mass at maturity is commonly observed in populations, even among individuals with the same genetic and environmental backgrounds. Accounting for such individual variation with a stochastic model is important for estimating optimal evolutionary strategies and for understanding potential trade-offs among life-history traits. However, most studies employ stochastic models that are either phenomenological or account for variation in only one life-history trait. We propose a model based on the developmental biology of the moth Manduca sexta that accounts for stochasticity in two key life-history traits, age and mass at maturity. The model is mechanistic, describing feeding behavior and common insect developmental processes, including the degradation of juvenile hormone prior to molting. We derive a joint probability density function for the model and explore how the distribution of age and mass at maturity is affected by different parameter values. We find that the joint distribution is generally nonnormal and highly sensitive to parameter values. In addition, our model predicts previously observed effects of temperature change and nutritional quality on the expected values of insect age and mass. Our results highlight the importance of integrating multiple sources of stochasticity into life-history models.","['Aging', 'Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Larva', 'Life History Traits', 'Manduca', 'Models, Statistical', 'Stochastic Processes']",32673092,"[['G07.345.124'], ['G07.203.650.161'], ['B01.050'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['B05.500.500', 'G07.345.500.550.500.500'], ['G05.045.513', 'G16.575'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.937.650.525'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['E05.318.740.996', 'G17.830', 'N05.715.360.750.770', 'N06.850.520.830.996']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
17265,Phytoestrogen coumestrol attenuates brain mitochondrial dysfunction and long-term cognitive deficits following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.,"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia (HI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is frequently associated with short and long-term neurologic and cognitive impairments. The HI injury causes mitochondrial damage leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phytoestrogens are non-steroidal plant substances structurally and functionally similar to estrogen. Coumestrol is a potent isoflavonoid with a protective effect against ischemic brain damage in adult rats. Our aim was to determine if coumestrol treatment following neonatal HI attenuates the long-term cognitive deficits induced by neonatal HI, as well as to investigate one possible mechanism underlying its potential effect.METHODS: On the 7th postnatal day, male Wistar rats were submitted to the Levine-Rice HI model. Intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg of coumestrol, or vehicle, were administered immediately pre-hypoxia or 3 h post-hypoxia. At 12 h after HI the mitochondrial status and ROS levels were determined. At 60th postnatal day the cognitive deficits were revealed in the Morris water maze reference and working spatial memories. Following behavioral analysis, histological assessment was performed and reactive astrogliosis was measured by GFAP expression.RESULTS: Results demonstrate that both pre- and post-HI administration of coumestrol were able to counteract the long-term cognitive and morphological impairments caused by HI, as well as to block the late reactive astrogliosis. The pre-HI administration of coumestrol was able to prevent the early mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus of injured rat pups.CONCLUSION: Present data suggest that coumestrol exerts protection against experimental neonatal brain hypoxia-ischemia through, at least in part, early modulation of mitochondrial function.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Coumestrol', 'Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain', 'Male', 'Maze Learning', 'Mitochondria', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Phytoestrogens', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",31693927,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['F02.463.188'], ['F03.615.250.700'], ['D03.383.663.283.266.450.400.187', 'D03.383.663.283.446.350', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.400.187', 'D03.633.100.150.446.350'], ['C10.228.140.300.150.716', 'C10.228.140.624.500', 'C14.907.253.092.716', 'C23.888.852.079.797.500'], ['F02.463.425.874.500'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['D27.505.696.399.472.277.540.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D01.339.431', 'D01.650.775']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
28793,Effects of the putatively oncogenic protein kinase Calpha D294G mutation on enzymatic activity and cell growth and its occurrence in human thyroid neoplasias.,"A point mutation of protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) has been described in pituitary adenomas and in follicular adenomas and thyroid carcinomas. The mutation results in an exchange of aspartic acid into a glycine of the amino acid 294 of PKCalpha, which is located adjacent to the Ca (2+)-binding hinge region and has been proposed as an activation inhibitor. To investigate its biochemical sequelae, we constructed the mutated enzyme and expressed it in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK). The K M of the purified enzyme for Ca (2+) and its K M for the substrate MBP 4 - 14 was not altered by the mutation. Translocation of PKCalpha to HEK cell membranes upon activation was not changed and the mutant potently inhibited cell proliferation upon 5-fold stable overexpression in HEK cells. Thus, loss of function in mutated PKCalpha was excluded. A screen for the mutation using a restriction assay with a sensitivity of at least 8 % for the mutated DNA did not show any mutation in 11 carcinoma and 13 adenomatous thyroid samples. We conclude that the A294G mutation of PKCalpha does not detectably affect its biochemical properties in vitro or in vivo, and is at least rare in thyroid neoplasias, in Germany.","['Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cytosol', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Thyroid Neoplasms', 'Transfection']",12173071,"[['G03.143'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A11.284.149'], ['A11.284.430.214.200', 'A11.284.430.429.200', 'A11.284.835.450.200'], ['A16.254'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['A05.810.453'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['G05.365.590'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725.100'], ['D02.455.849.291.500.510.850'], ['C04.588.322.894', 'C04.588.443.915', 'C19.344.894', 'C19.874.788'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18067,"Serosorting and recreational drug use are risk factors for diagnosis of genital infection with chlamydia and gonorrhoea among HIV-positive men who have sex with men: results from a clinical cohort in Ontario, Canada.","OBJECTIVES: Rates of chlamydia and gonorrhoea have been rising in urban centres in Canada, particularly among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Our objective was to identify behavioural risk factors for diagnosis with chlamydia and gonorrhoea in this population, with a focus on the HIV status of sexual partners.METHODS: The OHTN Cohort Study follows people in HIV care across Ontario. We restricted the analysis to 1997 MSM who completed questionnaires in 2010-2013 at one of seven clinics that submit all chlamydia and gonorrhoea tests to the provincial public health laboratory; we obtained test results via record linkage. We estimated cumulative incidences using Kaplan-Meier methods and identified risk factors for diagnosis of a composite outcome (chlamydia or gonorrhoea infection) using Cox regression.RESULTS: At follow-up, there were 74 new chlamydia/gonorrhoea diagnoses with a 12-month cumulative incidence of 1.7% (95% CI 1.1% to 2.2%). Risk factors for chlamydia/gonorrhoea diagnosis were: 5+ HIV-positive partners (HR=3.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 7.8; reference=none) and recreational drug use (HR=2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.9).CONCLUSIONS: Heightened risks with recreational drug use and multiple HIV-positive partners suggest that chlamydia/gonorrhoea may have achieved high prevalence in certain sexual networks among HIV-positive MSM. Interventions to promote safer sex and timely testing among MSM are needed.","['Chlamydia Infections', 'Gonorrhea', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Serosorting', 'Homosexuality, Male', 'Humans', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Male', 'Ontario', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Substance-Related Disorders']",27154185,"[['C01.150.252.400.210.125', 'C01.150.252.734.301', 'C01.221.812.281.301', 'C01.778.281.301', 'C12.294.668.281.301', 'C13.351.500.711.281.301'], ['C01.150.252.400.625.275', 'C01.150.252.734.401', 'C01.221.812.281.401', 'C01.778.281.401', 'C12.294.668.281.401', 'C13.351.500.711.281.401'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['F01.145.699.400', 'F01.145.802.400'], ['F01.145.802.975.500.600', 'G08.686.867.500.600'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D26.878'], ['Z01.107.567.176.639'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C25.775', 'F03.900']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

18401,Effect of progesterone/estradiol ratio on pregnancy outcome of patients with high trigger-day progesterone levels undergoing gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles: a retrospective cohort study.,"This study investigates the predictive power of serum progesterone/estradiol (P/E2) level for estimating the live birth rate in patients who had a serum progesterone (P) rate ? 1.5 ng/mL on the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration day and who received the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This retrospective cohort study included 176 cycles. The P/E2 ratio was lower in patients with a live birth (0.73 ± 0.54) than those without a live birth (1.05 ± 1.38), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = .158). According to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the hCG day P/E2 ratio, the area under the curve was 0.579 (95% confidence interval: 0.478 - 0.680, p = .158) for predicting live birth. In conclusion, this study suggests that a P/E2 ratio is not a significant predictor of a live birth rate in the patients with an hCG-day serum progesterone level of ?1.5 ng/mL undergoing GnRH antagonist ICSI cycles with a fresh embryo transfer. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? As the progesterone (P) levels in the late follicular phase correlate with the estradiol (E2) levels and the increase in mature follicles, earlier studies have proposed the trigger-day progesterone/estradiol (P/E2) ratio as a potential new marker for a premature luteinisation and live birth success. Most of these studies were conducted on long agonist cycles, and found that arbitrarily defined P/E2 ratio of >1 to be associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. What do the results of this study add? This study retrospectively examines the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist cycles with a trigger-day serum P value of ?1.5 ng/mL undergoing the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis did not identify a statistically significant threshold value for the trigger-day P/E2 ratio that was beneficial in predicting a live birth. The P/E2 ratio was also lower in the cycles with a live birth than those without a live birth, although the difference was not statistically significant. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The trigger-day P/E2 ratio does not seem to be an efficient prognostic factor for a live birth in the GnRH antagonist ICSI cycles with a trigger-day serum progesterone level of ?1.5 ng/mL. Further studies are needed to clarify the association of the trigger-day P/E2 ratio and the pregnancy outcomes in GnRH antagonist ICSI cycles.","['Adult', 'Birth Rate', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic']",30280612,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.308.985.775.500', 'N01.224.935.849.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.775.500', 'N06.850.520.308.985.775.500'], ['E02.875.800.500', 'E05.820.800.500'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.320', 'D12.644.400.400.740.320', 'D12.644.456.460', 'D12.644.548.365.740.320', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829', 'D06.472.334.734.623', 'D06.472.334.851.687.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E02.875.800.750.700', 'E05.820.800.750.700']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
12922,Renovation of the WWTP hove.,"The provision of reliable treatment has always been a priority in sanitary engineering. However, there is an ever-increasing pressure to meet desirable standards at reduced costs. This paper sets out a methodology to enhance the likelihood of a satisfactory allocation of the resources while providing reliable treatment. The procedure was gradually developed to optimise the massive capital investment of the Flemish Government to comply with the effluent standards set in the EU Directive 271/91. The methodology makes an extended use of dynamic modelling. To facilitate the identification and estimation of the uncertainty, a probabilistic Monte Carlo engine is coupled to the dynamic models. In doing so this approach provides a way of explicitly incorporating uncertainty and variability in the process analysis. The procedure is examined in an upgrade of a conventional WWTP towards stricter effluent norms on nutrients. The results suggest that the procedure can support the decision-making process under uncertainty conditions and enhance the likelihood of meeting effluent standards not entailing above-normal capital investments. The analysis led to reducing the capital investment by 43%, producing savings of more than 1.2 million Euros.","['Belgium', 'Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Sanitary Engineering', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid']",15954569,"[['Z01.542.115'], ['J01.256', 'N06.230.080'], ['E05.599'], ['E05.318.740.525', 'L01.906.394.422', 'N05.715.360.750.540', 'N06.850.520.830.525'], ['H02.229.656', 'J01.293.821', 'N06.850.780.200.800.800', 'N06.850.860.510'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1
33393,Clinical presentation and biochemical abnormalities in black (Zulu) patients with cirrhosis in Durban.,"A retrospective was designed to analyse the mode of presentation, clinical signs and haematological and biochemical abnormalities in 225 consecutive Black (Zulu) patients who were admitted to a general medical ward between the years 1970 and 1981 and in whom cirrhosis was later diagnosed. The most common presenting complaint was swelling of the body (60% of the patients), followed by abdominal pain (32%) and episodes of bleeding, mainly from the gastrointestinal tract (19%). On examination, hepatomegaly was encountered in 66% of the patients, with moderate to massive enlargement in 40%. Ascites was detected in 56%, with tense abdominal distension in 34%. Jaundice was present in 38% and emaciation, mental disturbance and splenomegaly in over 25%. Spider naevi (found in 2 patients) and Dupuytren's contracture (found in 1) were very rare. Thrombocytopenia and a high ESR were common. Over 90% of patients had low albumin and high globulin concentrations (albumin less than 20 g/dl and globulin greater than 60 g/dl in 25%). Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels and the prothrombin index were found to be within normal limits in 32%, 24% and 52% of cases respectively. Histologically the lesion was most commonly micronodular (73%) with variable deposits of fat and iron. Peritoneoscopy was the most useful special investigation in the diagnosis of cirrhosis, leading to a correct diagnosis in 77% of cases. In conclusion, the clinical signs, biochemical abnormalities and histological features suggest that the factors causing cirrhosis in the community studied are mixed; it may result from the combined effects of alcohol abuse, malnutrition and chronic viral (e.g. hepatitis B) infections.","['Abdomen', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Edema', 'Female', 'Hepatomegaly', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Alcoholic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain', 'Retrospective Studies']",7079888,"[['A01.923.047'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107', 'E01.370.225.625.107', 'E05.200.500.195.107', 'E05.200.625.107', 'E05.242.195.107', 'G04.140.107', 'G09.188.105'], ['M01.060.406'], ['C23.888.277'], ['C06.552.416', 'C23.300.775.525'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.552.630.380', 'C06.552.645.590', 'C23.550.355.412.380', 'C25.775.100.087.645.550'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

14669,Human mitochondrial DNA polymerase holoenzyme: reconstitution and characterization.,"We have reconstituted the holoenzyme of the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase from cloned and overexpressed catalytic and accessory subunits. We have examined the polymerization activity of the catalytic subunit alone and of the holoenzyme to establish the function of the accessory subunit in this two subunit enzyme. The accessory subunit associates with the catalytic subunit with a dissociation constant of 35 +/- 16 nM as measured by the concentration dependence of its effect in stimulating maximal DNA binding and polymerization. At saturating concentrations, the accessory subunit contributes to every kinetic parameter examined to facilitate tighter binding of DNA and nucleotide and faster replication. The accessory protein makes the DNA binding 3.5-fold tighter (K(d) of 9.9 +/- 2.1 nM compared to 39 +/- 10 nM for the catalytic subunit alone) without significantly affecting the DNA dissociation rate (0.02 +/- 0.001 compared to 0.03 +/- 0.001 s(-)(1)). The ground-state nucleotide binding is improved from 4.7 +/- 2.0 to 0.78 +/- 0.065 microM, and the maximum DNA polymerization rate is increased from 8.7 +/- 1.1 to 45 +/- 1 s(-)(1) by the addition of the accessory protein. This leads to an increase in processivity from an estimated 290 +/- 46 to 2250 +/- 162. Although the accessory protein has been described as a ""processivity factor"" because of its effect on the ratio of rate constants defining processivity, this terminology falls short of adequately describing the profound effects of the small subunit on nucleotide-binding and incorporation catalyzed by the large subunit. By using the complete holoenzyme, we can now proceed with a comprehensive analysis of the structural and mechanistic determinants of enzyme specificity that govern toxicity of nucleoside analogues used in the treatment of viral infections such as AIDS.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Catalytic Domain', 'DNA Polymerase gamma', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Holoenzymes', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases', 'Polymers', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Titrimetry', 'Xenopus laevis']",10677218,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['G02.111.570.120.704', 'G02.111.570.820.709.275.750.188'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.308.300.169', 'D12.776.575.280'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.308.300'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.410', 'D13.695.201.100', 'D13.695.667.138.410'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.750.310.250.500'], ['D08.811.255'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.644.541'], ['D08.811.520.650'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720'], ['D12.776.828'], ['E05.393.751'], ['E05.196.922'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.610.500.562']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
45620,Lipid peroxidation in early experimental diabetes in rats: effects of diabetes and insulin.,"The degree of lipid peroxidation was measured in organs from diabetic rats receiving no treatment, and in those from insulin-treated diabetic rats and controls. Lipid peroxidation was measured as organ content of malondialdehyde, a degradation product of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the kidney, lipid peroxidation was increased after one week of diabetes; insulin treatment reduced the level of lipid peroxidation to levels lower than seen in controls. In the liver, diabetes caused an increased lipid peroxidation, which could be reversed by insulin; no additional effect of insulin was found. In heart and pancreas no effects of diabetes or insulin were demonstrated. The present paper provides evidence that lipid peroxidation is increased in the early stages of experimental diabetes and is reversible by insulin treatment. Hyperinsulinaemia may, in itself, counteract lipid peroxidation in kidney.","['Animals', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Female', 'Insulin', 'Kidney', 'Lipid Peroxides', 'Liver', 'Malondialdehyde', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1595332,"[['B01.050'], ['C18.452.394.750.074', 'C19.246.240', 'E05.598.500.374'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['A05.810.453'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.637', 'D01.339.431.374.637', 'D01.650.550.750.600', 'D02.389.338.450', 'D10.440'], ['A03.620'], ['D02.047.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Data sheets were completed by participants, and an analysis was made of the first 100 registered patients to determine the reliability of clinical assessment related to pathological findings and to study the extent of axillary node clearance. Although all subjects were histologically node positive, 47 had no palpable axillary lymph nodes, and in only 38 were nodes considered to be clinically involved. Correlation between clinical and pathological measurements of breast tumour size was significantly better (86%) with tumours over 5 cm in extent than with tumours of 5 cm or less (70%). Total mastectomy with total axillary clearance was the most common operative procedure performed. The pectoralis major was preserved in 97 and the pectoralis minor was divided or removed in 71 cases as part of the axillary clearance. In a subgroup (33) the location of involved nodes in the axilla was studied, and of these seven (21%) were found to have involved upper axillary nodes in the absence of lower axillary nodal involvement, emphasizing the inadequacy of axillary sampling in determining nodal status.","['Axilla', 'Breast', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Lymph Nodes', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Mastectomy', 'Neoplasm Staging']",6937174,"[['A01.378.800.090'], ['A01.236'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E04.446'], ['A10.549.400', 'A15.382.520.604.412'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['E04.466'], ['E01.789.625']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We examined the synovial fluid from 38 TMD patients with disc displacement and 20 volunteers by gelatin zymography and immunoblotting analysis to clarify the involvement of the joint pathology from the viewpoint of expression of MMPs. Two gelatinolytic enzymes, MMP-2 and -9, were detected in the samples. The incidences of expression, except for pro-MMP-2, in anterior disc displacement (ADD) without reduction (ADD w/o R) were significantly higher than in ADD with reduction (ADD w R) (P<0.05). Quantitative analysis showed that the degree of MMP-2 and -9 expression in ADD w/ o R were higher than in ADD w R. These data suggest that the presence or absence of disc reduction is a major turning point in the process of joint destruction, and these MMPs are useful as biochemical markers for TMD diagnosis.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Joint Dislocations', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders']",11140902,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D23.101'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.320', 'E05.601.470.320'], ['C05.550.518', 'C26.289'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.205.352', 'D08.811.277.656.300.480.252.420', 'D08.811.277.656.300.480.525.700.150', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.205.352', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.252.420', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.525.700.150', 'D12.644.276.848.150', 'D12.776.467.836.150'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.205.360', 'D08.811.277.656.300.480.252.445', 'D08.811.277.656.300.480.525.700.350', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.205.360', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.252.445', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.525.700.350', 'D12.644.276.848.350', 'D12.776.467.836.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05.550.114.606', 'C05.799.613'], ['A02.835.583.443.800.800', 'A12.207.270.847'], ['C05.500.607.221.897', 'C05.550.905', 'C05.651.243.897', 'C07.320.610.291.897', 'C07.678']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
34063,Concurrent progressive-ratio schedules to compare reinforcing effectiveness of different phencyclidine (PCP) concentrations in rhesus monkeys.,"RATIONALE: Progressive ratio (PR) schedules have become well accepted for testing the reinforcing effectiveness of drugs. This study extends the methods to concurrent PR schedules with different concentrations of orally delivered phencyclidine (PCP).OBJECTIVE: The sensitivity of the procedure is tested by presenting different PCP concentrations with independently-operating PR schedules.METHOD: PCP self-administration was investigated in seven rhesus monkeys. Six different PCP concentrations (0.03-1.0 mg/ml) and water were randomly paired (21 pairings). Liquid delivery (24 ml) was contingent upon lip-contact responses on solenoid-operated drinking spouts; whereby, the response requirement or fixed-ratio (FR) increased (from 8 to 16, 32, 64, 128... to 4096) after each successful completion of a previous FR and subsequent liquid delivery. Monkeys self administered PCP during daily 3-h sessions, and each pair of concentrations was held constant until behavior had stabilized for at least 4 days.RESULTS: The higher of the two PCP concentrations always maintained greater responding, PR break point (BP), or the last ratio completed, and liquid deliveries than did the lower concentration. However, the monkeys did not exclusively respond on the drinking spout that yielded the higher drug concentration. When examined across all drug pairings, the percentage of total available deliveries of the higher concentration was significantly greater than those of the lower concentration. The monkeys maximized the amount (mg) consumed for the response output. Responding, BPs and liquid deliveries maintained by 0.12 and 0.25 mg/ml PCP were significantly greater than other PCP concentrations; however, drug intake (mg) increased directly with PCP concentration.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that concurrent PR schedules using oral drug self-administration and a concurrent choice paradigm reliably provide an estimation of relative reinforcing strength, and behavior maintained by these schedules is sensitive to small changes in PCP concentration.","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Hallucinogens', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Phencyclidine', 'Reinforcement Schedule']",10394998,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['B01.050'], ['F01.145.113'], ['D27.505.696.388', 'D27.505.954.427.700.372'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.510.550'], ['D03.383.621.699'], ['F02.463.425.770.644']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The initial concentration of herbicide, scavengers and irradiation doses play a significant role in the degradation efficiency as shown by decay constants of atrazine residues. gamma-Radiolysis showed that atrazine exhibited high degradation percentages at low absorbed doses in HS aqueous solutions compared to distilled water solutions. Absorbed doses from 0.6 to 21 kGy and from 6 to 72 kGy at a dose rate of 14.52 kGyh(-1) achieved 90% degradation for atrazine with initial concentrations over the range 0.464-4.636 microM in humic and distilled water solutions, respectively. The radiolytic degradation by-products and their mass balances were qualitatively determined with good confidence using gas chromatography/quadruple mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with electron impact ionization (EI(+)) mode.","['Atrazine', 'Decontamination', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Restoration and Remediation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Herbicides', 'Humic Substances', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Water Purification']",18597846,"[['D03.383.931.247'], ['N06.850.780.325'], ['E05.799.513.500', 'G01.750.740.500', 'G04.712.500', 'G07.225', 'G07.738.500', 'N06.850.810.250.180'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['N06.230.080.600', 'N06.850.460.375'], ['G01.358.500.505.300', 'G01.750.250.300', 'G01.750.750.400'], ['E05.196.181.349.500', 'E05.196.566.500'], ['D27.720.031.700.366', 'D27.888.723.366'], ['D02.241.444', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.377', 'D20.721.500'], ['D27.720.031.700.672', 'D27.888.723.697', 'N06.850.460.200.700'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.900.900', 'N06.850.860.510.900.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
43054,Hypoplastic vertebral artery: frequency and associations with ischaemic stroke territory.,"BACKGROUND: In patients with posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction (PICAI) or lateral medullary infarction (LMI), the ipsilateral vertebral artery is often hypoplastic and therefore at an increased risk of ischaemic stroke.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency and clinical relevance of hypoplastic vertebral artery (HVA) in patients with ischaemic stroke with or without vertebral artery territory and in normal healthy people.METHODS: 529 patients with ischaemic stroke, including vertebral artery territory infarction (LMI or PICAI), were classified according to their stroke location (303 anterior circulation strokes (ACS) and 226 posterior circulation strokes (PCS)) by MRI. The frequency of HVA, defined as a diameter of < or = 2 mm by magnetic resonance angiography, was measured in comparison with 306 normal healthy people.RESULTS: 185 patients (35.2%) from the cohort had HVA (3.4%, bilaterally). Patients with PCS showed a higher rate of HVA than those with ACS (45.6% vs 27.1%, p<0.001). The HVA frequency of those with ACS was similar to that of the normal group (26.5%). Of the 112 patients with vertebral artery territory stroke, 58 (51.8%) had HVA (bilateral HVA in 10), and all of 48 showed ipsilateral HVA territory stroke. In 102 patients with vertebral artery territory stroke, classification of the ipsilateral vertebral artery as hypoplastic (vs dominant or symmetric) tended to predict the involvement of multiple and extensive lesions, and a higher incidence of steno-occlusion (p<0.001).CONCLUSION: HVA is not rare in the normal population, and is frequent in patients with PCS. People with HVA may have a high probability of PCS, with atherosclerotic susceptibility and ipsilateral lesions in the vertebral artery territory.","['Aged', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Stroke', 'Vertebral Artery']",17098838,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C10.228.140.300.150', 'C14.907.253.092'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C10.500.190', 'C14.240.850.875', 'C16.131.240.850.875', 'C16.131.666.190'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855'], ['A07.015.114.955']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
14466,Costs and outcomes associated with IVF using recombinant FSH.,"Cost and outcome estimates based on clinical trial data may not reflect usual clinical practice, yet they are often used to inform service provision and budget decisions. To expand understanding of assisted reproduction treatment in clinical practice, an economic evaluation of IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) data from a single assisted conception unit (ACU) in England was performed. A total of 1418 IVF/ICSI cycles undertaken there between October 2001 and January 2006 in 1001 women were analysed. The overall live birth rate was 22% (95% CI: 19.7-24.2), with the 30- to 34-year age group achieving the highest rate (28%). The average recombinant FSH (rFSH) dose/cycle prescribed was 1855 IU. Average cost of rFSH/cycle was 646 pound(SD: 219 pound), and average total cost/cycle was 2932 pound (SD: 422 pound). Economic data based on clinical trials informing current UK guidance assumes higher doses of rFSH dose/cycle (1750-2625 IU), higher average cost of drugs/cycle (1179 pound), and higher average total cost/cycle (3266 pound). While the outcomes in this study matched UK averages, total cost/cycle was lower than those cited in UK guidelines. Utilizing the protocols and (lower) rFSH dosages reported in this study may enable other ACU to provide a greater number of IVF/ICSI cycles to patients within given budgets.","['Adult', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fertility Agents, Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female', 'Maternal Age', 'Pregnancy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic', 'Treatment Outcome']",19778478,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N03.219.151'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D27.505.696.875.552.344', 'D27.505.954.705.552.344'], ['E02.875.800.750', 'E05.820.800.750'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.288', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343.288', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343.288'], ['N04.761.337', 'N05.715.360.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C13.351.500.365.700'], ['G08.686.560', 'N05.715.350.075.550', 'N06.850.490.250.550'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['D12.776.828'], ['E02.875.800.750.700', 'E05.820.800.750.700'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
44042,Serum elevations of soluble Fas (CD95/apo-I) concur in deregulating T cell apoptosis during active lupus disease.,"Apoptosis is deregulated in active systemic lupus erythematosus and Fas is overexpressed by T cells, although the role of its soluble form (sFas) is unclear. We have explored both the biological significance and structure of sFas in relation to the disease activity. Serum levels of both sFas and sFas-L were correlated with T cell apoptosis in 26 systemic lupus eythematosus patients along with measurement of poly (ADP) ribose polymerase and CK18. In addition, both proliferative rate and change of ploidy were measured in CD3+ cells after treatment with sFas. Both sFas and sFas-L correlated with apoptosis in patients with active systemic lupus eythematosus. Incubation with sFas greatly suppressed proliferation of CD3+ cells from inactive patients and healthy donors, whereas immunoprecipitation revealed both the 48-kDa full-length Fas and the 26-kDa splicing variant in sera from active patients. We postulate that sFas is released to exert a pro-apoptogen effect. It seems possible that the apoptosis program itself includes the shedding/secretion of different forms of Fas to spread a death signal.","['Apoptosis', 'CD3 Complex', 'Caspases', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic', 'Mitochondria', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Protein Isoforms', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'fas Receptor']",12049185,"[['G04.146.954.035'], ['D23.050.301.264.894.095', 'D23.101.100.894.095'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126', 'D12.644.360.075.405', 'D12.776.476.075.405'], ['A11.251'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['D23.050.550'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.393.475'], ['C17.300.480', 'C20.111.590'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.115.690'], ['D12.776.800'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569'], ['D12.776.543.750.690.500', 'D12.776.543.750.705.852.760.195']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
39147,The uncovering and characterization of a CCKoma syndrome in enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Neuroendocrine tumors in the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract may secrete hormones which cause specific syndromes. Well-known examples are gastrinomas, glucagonomas, and insulinomas. Cholecystokinin-producing tumors (CCKomas) have been induced experimentally in rats, but a CCKoma syndrome in man has remained unknown until now.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a panel of immunoassays for CCK peptides and proCCK as well as for chromogranin A, we have examined plasma samples from 284 fasting patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. In hyperCCKemic samples, plasma CCK was further characterized by chromatography.RESULTS: One of the patients displayed gross hyperCCKemia. She was a 58-year old woman with a pancreatic endocrine tumor, liver metastases, 500-1000-fold elevated basal CCK concentration in plasma, diarrhea, severe weight loss, recurrent peptic ulcer and bilestone attacks from a contracted gallbladder. The CCK concentrations in plasma were not affected by resection of the pancreatic tumor, but decreased to normal after hemihepatectomy with removal of the metastases.CONCLUSION: A CCKoma syndrome with severe hypersecretion of CCK exists in man. The duodenal ulcer disease and diarrhea with permanently low gastrin in plasma suggest that CCKomas may mimic gastrinoma-like symptoms, because CCK peptides are full agonists of the gastrin/CCK-B receptor.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Cholecystokinin', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Gastrinoma', 'Gastrins', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Neoplasms', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Rats', 'Stomach Neoplasms', 'Young Adult']",27191542,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['B01.050'], ['M01.060.406'], ['D06.472.317.152', 'D12.644.120'], ['Z01.542.816.124'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.290.500', 'C04.588.274.761.500.124', 'C04.588.322.475.500.124', 'C06.301.761.500.124', 'C06.689.667.500.124', 'C19.344.421.500.124'], ['D06.472.317.413', 'D06.472.699.280', 'D12.644.400.320', 'D12.644.548.280', 'D12.776.631.650.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.274.476.411', 'C06.301.371.411', 'C06.405.249.411', 'C06.405.469.491'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.557.465.625.650', 'C04.557.580.625.650'], ['A03.734'], ['C04.588.274.761', 'C04.588.322.475', 'C06.301.761', 'C06.689.667', 'C19.344.421'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['C04.588.274.476.767', 'C06.301.371.767', 'C06.405.249.767', 'C06.405.748.789'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

Mycobacterial colonization was not impacted by vaccination. Positive prognostic indicators associated with reduced pathology in the BCG-vaccinated group were decreased antigen induced IFN-gamma, iNOS, IL-4, and MIP1-alpha responses, increased antigen induced FoxP3 expression, and a diminished activation phenotype (i.e., downward arrow CD25+ and CD44+ cells and upward arrow CD62L+ cells) in mycobacterial-stimulated mononuclear cell cultures.

37800,A left ventricular end-diastolic dimension less than 6.0 cm is associated with mortality after implantation of an axial-flow pump.,"OBJECTIVE: The effects of having a lower left ventricular end-diastolic dimension before HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, Calif) left ventricular assist device implantation remain unclear. We analyzed our single-center data on HeartMate II implantation to determine whether having a lower left ventricular end-diastolic dimension preoperatively was associated with inferior outcomes.METHODS: From November 2003 to March 2016, 393 patients with chronic heart failure underwent primary HeartMate II implantation. We compared the preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and associated survival outcomes of these patients to determine the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension cutoff for worse overall survival. Then, we compared the preoperative demographics, stroke rate, and mortality of patients with a left ventricular end-diastolic dimension above the cutoff for worse survival with those of patients with a left ventricular end-diastolic dimension below the cutoff.RESULTS: A Cox multivariate regression model showed that low left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio, 1.49; P = .02). The Contal and O'Quigley method showed that overall survival postimplantation was decreased in patients with a left ventricular end-diastolic dimension less than 6.0 cm (n = 91). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension less than 6.0 cm group had lower overall survival than the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension 6.0 cm or greater group (P = .04). Furthermore, a competing-risk analysis showed that postoperative stroke was more common in the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension less than 6.0 cm group than in the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension 6.0 cm or greater group (P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival was decreased and postoperative stroke was increased in HeartMate II recipients with a preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic dimension less than 6.0 cm. Future research should determine the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension cutoff values for safely implanting other support devices, and device designs should be improved to better accommodate the needs of patients with a limited left ventricle size.","['Diastole', 'Female', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Heart-Assist Devices', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prosthesis Implantation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left', 'Ventricular Function']",30797583,"[['G09.330.580.295', 'G11.427.494.554.250', 'G11.427.494.570.295'], ['A07.541.560'], ['E04.050.430', 'E07.695.300.300', 'E07.858.082.374.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E04.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['C14.280.945.900'], ['G09.330.955']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We have focused on the role of Mre11 and Rad50 proteins, which are found in all domains of life and which form a complex that binds to and coordinates the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Surprisingly, mre11 rad50 mutants are more resistant to DNA damage than the wild-type. However, wild-type cells recover faster from DNA damage, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis shows that DNA double-strand breaks are repaired more slowly in mre11 rad50 mutants. Using a plasmid repair assay, we show that wild-type and mre11 rad50 cells use different strategies of DSB repair. In the wild-type, Mre11-Rad50 appears to prevent the repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (HR), allowing microhomology-mediated end-joining to act as the primary repair pathway. However, genetic analysis of recombination-defective radA mutants suggests that DNA repair in wild-type cells ultimately requires HR, therefore Mre11-Rad50 merely delays this mode of repair. In polyploid organisms, DSB repair by HR is potentially hazardous, since each DNA end will have multiple partners. We show that in the polyploid archaeon H. volcanii the repair of DSBs by HR is restrained by Mre11-Rad50. The unrestrained use of HR in mre11 rad50 mutants enhances cell survival but leads to slow recovery from DNA damage, presumably due to difficulties in the resolution of DNA repair intermediates. Our results suggest that recombination might be similarly repressed in other polyploid organisms and at repetitive sequences in haploid and diploid species.","['Archaeal Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genome, Bacterial', 'Haloferax volcanii', 'Mutation', 'Polyploidy', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",19593371,"[['D12.776.090'], ['G04.346'], ['G05.200.210.220'], ['G02.111.222', 'G05.219'], ['D12.776.260'], ['D08.811.277.352.335.350', 'D08.811.277.352.355.325'], ['D08.811.277.352.335.375', 'D08.811.277.352.365.290'], ['E05.393.335.750'], ['G05.360.340.358.207'], ['B02.200.400.400.440.900'], ['G05.365.590'], ['C23.550.210.702', 'G05.365.590.175.677', 'G05.700.740'], ['G05.728'], ['G05.365.590.762', 'G05.558.800'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
11976,Frequency of Secondary Dislocations of Initially non Displaced and Minimally Displaced Fractures of the Lateral Humeral Condyle in Children - Surveillance of a Treatment Algorithm.,"AIM OF THE STUDY: The treatment of undisplaced fractures of the lateral humeral condyle is conservative. However, it is problematic that it is not possible to differentiate between a stable and an unstable, non-displaced fracture. A pragmatic approach is to X-ray the elbow without a cast 5 days after trauma and to compare those images with the initial ones. If there is a central increase of dislocation, then there is an indication of an unstable fracture. The dislocation can also be indicated by a translational movement, which is best observed in the border area. The aim of the study was to retrospectively determine the incidence of secondary dislocations of initially undisplaced and minimally dislocated fractures of the lateral humeral condyle in infants between 2010 and 2015.METHODS: We performed a retrospective, non-randomized analysis of 75 children with initially undisplaced and minimally displaced fractures of the lateral humeral condyle between 2010 and 2015. The strategy for the evaluation of a stable and an unstable fracture of the lateral humeral condyle was carried out by means of an X-ray without a cast 5 days after trauma. Further radiological controls were performed after 14 days, 4 weeks and after 10 to 12 weeks in operated children.RESULTS: Seven initially undisplaced and minimally dislocated fractures (9,3%) showed a secondary dislocation 5 days after trauma when a radiological control without a cast was performed. At the control 14 days after trauma there was no further secondary dislocation. The immobilization took place in an upper arm cast for a period of 4 weeks.CONCLUSION: 90% of all non-dislocated fractures of the lateral humeral condyle can be treated conservatively. It is important to find out which about 10% of children will experience a secondary dislocation safely and effectively. It has been shown that the strategy for the evaluation of a stable and an unstable fracture of the lateral humeral condyle by means of a radiological control after 5 days without a cast can be effective and cost-saving. With a high degree of certainty, the unstable fracture can be detected at the radiological control 5 days after trauma. If, after 5 days, the radiological control reveals unsure finding regarding the dislocation, it is advisable to recheck the fracture in the second radiological control after 14 days.","['Algorithms', 'Child', 'Elbow Joint', 'Humans', 'Humeral Fractures', 'Humerus', 'Infant', 'Retrospective Studies']",31117144,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['M01.060.406'], ['A02.835.583.290'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C26.088.390', 'C26.404.500'], ['A02.835.232.087.090.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
11884,Can adenocarcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix be treated safely by conisation in combination with endocervical curettage?,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic value of endocervical curettage (ECC) after conisation in patients treated for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of the uterine cervix.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with AIS diagnosed between 1990 and 2010 and with a minimum of 1.5 years of follow-up were retrospectively identified using computerised clinical files.RESULTS: The authors identified 195 patients (median age 32 years) with a median follow-up of 6.4 years. ECC was performed in 165 patients. In 144 (87%) the initial ECC was normal. In 129 no recurrence was observed during follow-up (90%). A positive ECC was observed in 21. Thirteen patients had hysterectomies; six hysterectomies were normal. Eight patients treated conservatively developed no recurrent disease. Two patients with a positive ECC did not have a hysterectomy and developed recurrent disease. In patients with affected margins, 17% developed recurrent disease.CONCLUSION: ECC performed during initial conisation is a prognostic tool for the treatment ofAIS. Close follow-up is recommended in patients treated conservatively.","['Adenocarcinoma in Situ', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Conization', 'Curettage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hysterectomy', 'Middle Aged', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms']",25556275,"[['C04.557.470.200.025.014', 'C04.557.470.200.240.124', 'C23.149.249'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.160', 'E01.370.225.998.054.160', 'E01.370.388.100.160', 'E04.074.160', 'E05.200.500.384.100.160', 'E05.200.998.054.160', 'E05.242.384.100.160'], ['E04.157'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E04.950.300.399'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.850', 'C13.351.500.852.593.131', 'C13.351.500.852.762.850', 'C13.351.937.418.875.850']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
7753,Abnormal drug metabolism in chronic pancreatitis. Treatment with antioxidants.,"Functional and morphological changes in hepatocytes, indicating induction of the drug metabolizing enzymes and free radical-mediated damage, were found in 4 patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. The possibility that reflux of abnormal bile (rich in lipid peroxidation and other products generated through hepatic metabolism of xenobiotics) into the pancreatic duct may initiate pancreatic damage was negated when bile duct ligation and bile diversion did not abolish attacks of pancreatitis in 3 cases, although the evidence of reflux was indisputable in 1 of them who also had a pancreatoduodenectomy. Pancreatic acinar cells from that patient showed extensive microvesiculation, as did hepatocytes from each case. These observations suggest that pancreatic and liver damage in chronic pancreatitis proceed independently but by the same mechanism-heightened, but unmitigated, oxidative detoxification of xenobiotics by cytochromes P450. Therefore, although bile reflux is not a prerequisite, it could compound injury in the head of the gland. Antioxidants were prescribed to the 3 cases mentioned and, from the outset, to a fourth patient who showed the same liver changes. This unconventional approach has held attacks at bay during a follow-up period of 5 yr.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antioxidants', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Disease', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Methionine', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatectomy', 'Pancreatitis', 'Selenium', 'Tablets']",2298375,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['E02.186'], ['E02.319.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.620'], ['D02.886.030.676', 'D12.125.142.557', 'D12.125.154.549', 'D12.125.166.676'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A03.734'], ['E04.210.752'], ['C06.689.750'], ['D01.268.185.850', 'D01.578.700'], ['D26.255.830']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
18011,Detection and capture of breast cancer cells with photoacoustic flow cytometry.,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths among women. Metastasis—the presence of secondary tumors caused by the spread of cancer cells via the circulatory or lymphatic systems—significantly worsens the prognosis of any breast cancer patient. A technique is developed to detect circulating breast cancer cells in human blood using a photoacoustic flow cytometry method. A Q-switched laser is used to interrogate thousands of blood cells with one pulse as they flow through the beam path. Cells that are optically absorbing, either naturally or artificially, emit an ultrasound wave as a result of the photoacoustic (PA) effect. Breast cancer cells are targeted with chromophores through immunochemistry in order to enhance optical absorption. After which, the PA cytometry device is calibrated to demonstrate the ability to detect single cells. Cultured breast cancer cells are added to whole blood to reach a biologically relevant concentration of about 25 to 45 breast cancer cells per 1 mL of blood. An in vitro PA flow cytometer is used to detect and isolate these cells followed by capture with the use of a micromanipulator. This method can not only be used to determine the disease state of the patient and the response to therapy but also it can be used for genetic testing and in vitro drug trials since the circulating cell can be captured and studied.","['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lasers', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Photoacoustic Techniques']",27580367,"[['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.363', 'E05.200.500.363', 'E05.242.363'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E07.632.490', 'E07.710.520'], ['A11.642', 'C04.697.650.900', 'C23.550.727.650.900'], ['E01.370.565', 'E05.696']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fifty-three adolescents and young adults (age 16.1-29.7) with different grades of diabetic retinopathy and microalbuminuria were also selected (group 4). A total of 223 healthy controls were matched for age and sex with each group of patients with diabetes mellitus.RESULTS: VEGF serum levels were significantly increased in pre-school and pre-pubertal children with diabetes as well as in pubertal patients compared to controls. VEGF concentrations were markedly increased in adolescents and young adults with microvascular complications compared with both healthy controls and diabetic patients without retinopathy or nephropathy. Multivariate analysis showed that elevation of VEGF in serum was an independent correlate of complications. One-year mean HbA1c values were significantly correlated with VEGF concentrations (r = 0.372; P < 0.01). Children with HbA1c levels greater than 10% had significantly higher VEGF concentrations when compared with matched patients whose HbA1c levels were lower than 10%. In poorly controlled diabetic children (HbA1c > 10%), long-term (2 years) improvement of glycaemic control (aiming at HbA1c < 7%) resulted in a significant reduction of VEGF levels.CONCLUSIONS: VEGF serum concentrations are increased in prepubertal and pubertal children with diabetes. Glycaemic control influences VEGF serum levels. Severity of microvascular complications is associated with marked increase of VEGF concentrations in the serum of these patients.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Blood Glucose', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Insulin', 'Lymphokines', 'Reference Values', 'Regression Analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",11051284,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['G07.345.124'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C18.452.394.750.124', 'C19.246.267', 'C20.111.327'], ['C14.907.320', 'C19.246.099.500'], ['C11.768.257', 'C14.907.320.382', 'C19.246.099.500.382'], ['D12.644.276.390', 'D12.776.467.390', 'D23.529.390'], ['D09.400.430.937', 'D12.776.124.400.405.440', 'D12.776.395.381', 'D12.776.422.316.762.380.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['D12.644.276.374.480', 'D12.776.467.374.480', 'D23.529.374.480'], ['E05.978.810'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200'], ['D12.644.276.100.800', 'D12.776.467.100.800', 'D23.529.100.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
14862,Controllable synthesis and characterization of porous polyvinyl alcohol/hydroxyapatite nanocomposite scaffolds via an in situ colloidal technique.,"During the last decades, there have been several attempts to combine bioactive materials with biocompatible and biodegradable polymers to create nanocomposite scaffolds with excellent biocompatibility, bioactivity, biodegradability and mechanical properties. In this research, the nanocomposite scaffolds with compositions based on PVA and HAp nanoparticles were successfully prepared using colloidal HAp nanoparticles combined with freeze-drying technique for tissue engineering applications. In addition, the effect of the pH value of the reactive solution and different percentages of PVA and HAp on the synthesis of PVA/HAp nanocomposites were investigated. The SEM observations revealed that the prepared scaffolds were porous with three dimensional microstructures, and in vitro experiments with osteoblast cells indicated an appropriate penetration of the cells into the scaffold's pores, and also the continuous increase in cell aggregation on the scaffolds with increase in the incubation time demonstrated the ability of the scaffolds to support cell growth. According to the obtained results, the nanocomposite scaffolds could be considered as highly bioactive and potential bone tissue engineering implants.","['Biocompatible Materials', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Durapatite', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nanocomposites', 'Polyvinyl Alcohol', 'Porosity', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Tissue Engineering']",21310596,"[['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['A11.251'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374.075.025.300.150', 'D01.146.360.050.300.200', 'D01.578.122.477.300', 'D01.695.625.675.650.075.025.300.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.580', 'E05.595.402.580'], ['J01.637.512.150'], ['D02.033.750', 'D02.455.326.271.884.533.532', 'D05.750.716.721.616', 'D25.720.716.721.616', 'J01.637.051.720.716.721.616'], ['G01.374.710'], ['E05.196.712.726.676.700', 'E05.196.867.826.676.700'], ['E05.481.500.311.500', 'J01.293.069.249.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
3593,The effect of routine intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography on surgical management.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of routine intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) on surgical management of patients undergoing all types of cardiac surgery.DESIGN: Prospective, observational.SETTING: A single-institution, clinical investigation, university-affiliated hospital.PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-three consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery.INTERVENTIONS: A comprehensive TEE examination was performed in every patient after the induction of anesthesia. An appropriate surgical plan was then developed. A focused TEE examination was also performed at the conclusion of surgery. Whether or not TEE findings represented new information and whether or not this new information altered surgical management was documented.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 106 new TEE findings in 87 patients (31%). Half of the new findings involved the mitral valve, and a quarter involved the tricuspid valve. The new TEE information altered surgical management 77 ways in 71 patients (25%). Half of the altered surgical managements involved the mitral valve, and a third involved the tricuspid valve. In 8 patients (3%), TEE information influenced decisions regarding use/nonuse of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In 2 patients, TEE examination after the separation from CPB prompted reinitiation of CPB. In 1 patient, TEE examination after the induction of general anesthesia prompted cancellation of surgery.CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of TEE during cardiac surgery revealed new cardiac pathology in 1 of every 3 patients and led to altered surgical management in 1 of every 4 patients. TEE information also influenced decisions regarding use/nonuse of CPB in 3% of patients. Thus, the authors suggest that intraoperative TEE should be used routinely in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery.","['Cardiac Surgical Procedures', 'Decision Making', 'Echocardiography, Transesophageal', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Humans', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Mitral Valve', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tricuspid Valve']",18068055,"[['E04.100.376', 'E04.928.220'], ['F02.463.785.373'], ['E01.370.350.130.750.235', 'E01.370.350.850.220.235', 'E01.370.370.380.220.235'], ['C14.280.484'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.760.731.400', 'E04.604.249', 'N02.421.585.722.400'], ['A07.541.510.507'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['A07.541.510.893']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
25354,Neuronal activity and its influence on developmentally regulated GABA(A) receptor expression in cultured mouse cerebellar granule cells.,"Mouse cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) were cultured in either non-depolarising (5 mM KCl, '5K') or depolarising (25 mM KCl, '25K') media. CGCs at 5K developed an elaborate network of processes and formed compact cell aggregates, whilst at 25K, cell aggregation was rarely observed. GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) expression was significantly affected by the culture conditions. Depolarisation resulted in a approximately 55% reduction in the expression of total specific [(3)H]Ro15-4513 binding sites, largely due to a >85% loss of the flunitrazepam-insensitive (BZ-IS) subtype of binding sites. The number of flunitrazepam-sensitive (BZ-S) [(3)H]Ro15-4513 binding sites expressed and the K(D) of [(3)H]Ro15-4513 to either GABAR subtype were not significantly affected. The BZ-S subtype expressed by 5K CGCs was essentially all type I, as expected of mature CGCs, however at 25K, these were predominantly type II (approximately 70%) and zolpidem-insensitive (approximately 30%)-pharmacological finger-prints of immature CGCs. By immunoblotting we determined that CGCs cultured at 25K expressed GABAR alpha1, alpha6 and beta3 subunits at 14, 3 and 167% of 5K levels, respectively. GABAR beta2 subunits, however, were barely detectable. The changes in GABAR subunit expression were paralleled by similar changes in the steady-state levels of the subunit mRNAs. The switch from type I to type II BZ-S pharmacology upon depolarisation was mirrored by a switch in gene expression from alpha1 (12% of 5K) to alpha3 (371% of 5K). Interestingly, although depolarisation reduced beta2 subunit mRNA to 25% of 5K, beta2 protein was undetectable.Thus, we have shown that electrically active (5K) mouse CGCs differentiate in vitro to express a GABAR profile expected of adult CGCs in vivo. Chronically depolarised, electrically silent CGCs appear to be developmentally arrested, expressing some GABAR characteristics of prenatal CGCs. This model system should prove invaluable for elucidating signalling pathways orchestrating GABAR differentiation.","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebellum', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Electrophysiology', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'RNA', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Complement 3b', 'Receptors, GABA-A', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",12367617,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251'], ['A08.186.211.132.810.428.200'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D13.444.735'], ['E01.370.225.985', 'E01.370.374.650', 'E01.370.384.720', 'E05.200.985'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.833.600'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.175.562', 'D12.776.157.530.400.400.100.100', 'D12.776.543.550.450.175.562', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.100.100', 'D12.776.543.585.400.175.562', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.100.100', 'D12.776.543.750.130.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.300.300'], ['E05.393.620.500.725']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
44964,The evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of hachimi-jio-gan (traditional Chinese medicine) to rat galactosemic cataract.,"Hachimi-jio-gan (Rehmannia Eight Formula, pa-wei-ti-huang-wan or Bawei dihuang wan) is one of traditional Chinese medicines which has been used for treating various senile disease for a few hundred years. This drug was evaluated for its therapeutic efficacy to rat galactosemic cataract from the suppressive rate of variance of some biochemical parameters, whose variation with cataractogenesis or the advance of cataract have been reported already. The dose of 500mg of Hachimi-jio-gan/day/200g of rat body weight suppressed significantly the variations of hydration rate, Na/K ratios, and calcium ion level in the lens with the advance of galactosemic cataract, especially when the drug was administered by the pre- or concurrent-administration before or with 30% of galactose diet respectively. This drug also could delay the progressive rate of lens opacification. However, the drug had no effect to suppress the galactitol accumulation in the lens. From these results, we presume that a drug action of Hachimi-jio-gan may control the balance of sodium, potassium and calcium ions which are important in relation to the maintenance of lens transparency. Then, we realized, that this drug may have a prophylactic efficacy to diabetic cataract, though a more detail study should be needed to apply this drug to human cataract disease.","['Animals', 'Calcium', 'Cataract', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Galactosemias', 'Lens, Crystalline', 'Male', 'Potassium', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sodium', 'Therapeutic Equivalency']",3503915,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['C11.510.245'], ['D20.215.784.500.350', 'D26.335'], ['C10.228.140.163.100.320', 'C16.320.565.189.320', 'C16.320.565.202.355', 'C18.452.132.100.320', 'C18.452.648.189.320', 'C18.452.648.202.355'], ['A09.371.060.500'], ['D01.268.549.550', 'D01.268.557.575', 'D01.552.528.652', 'D01.552.547.650'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['G03.787.559', 'G07.690.725.898']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The aim of the study was to relate dental state to dietary habits and, furthermore, to study the possible influence of some social factors on these relations. The degree of dental invalidity was measured with Eichner's index. There was a highly significant correlation between this index and the number of teeth and tooth contacts. Dietary interviews were performed by a dietitian according to the dietary history method. Intake of several food items was significantly inversely related to the degree of dental invalidity in males but less so in females. The proportion of probands with insufficient intake of nutrients was in one or more respects higher among the edentulous than in the dentate and highest in the female edentulous probands with only one or no denture. Insufficient intakes of some nutrients were significantly related to the degree of dental invalidity. These relations remained unchanged in males but not in females when some socio-economic factors were introduced as confounding factors in a multivariate relation analysis; which might be due to the fact that these social factors play a more important role in females than in males.","['Aged', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jaw, Edentulous, Partially', 'Male', 'Mastication', 'Oral Health', 'Sex Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sweden']",6960162,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C05.500.480.450', 'C07.320.550.450', 'C07.465.550.425.450', 'C07.793.597.425.450'], ['G07.203.650.283.500', 'G10.261.330.500'], ['N01.400.535'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['Z01.542.816.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
24367,Repeat prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test before prostate biopsy: a 20% decrease in PSA values is associated with a reduced risk of cancer and particularly of high-grade cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the impact of repeating a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level assessment on prostate biopsy decision in a cohort of men undergoing prostate biopsy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2015 onwards, we consecutively enrolled, at a single institution in Italy, men undergoing 12-core transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate needle biopsy. Indication for prostate biopsy was a PSA level of ?4 ng/mL. Demographic, clinical, and histopathological data were collected. The PSA level was tested at enrolment (PSA1 ) and 4 weeks later on the day before biopsy (PSA2 ). Variations in PSA level were defined as: stable PSA2 within a 10% variation, stable PSA2 within a 20% variation, PSA2 decreased by ?10%, PSA2 decreased by ?20%, PSA2 increased by ?10%, PSA2 increased by ?20%, and PSA2 <4 ng/mL. Percentages and multinomial logistic regression were used to analyse biopsy outcomes. High-grade cancer was defined as Grade group ?3.RESULTS: Overall, 331 patients were enrolled. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 153/331 (46%) patients and of them 80/153 (52%) had high-grade disease. When compared to the rest of the population, patients with a stable PSA within 20% variation had a higher risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] 1.80, P < 0.05) and high grade disease (OR 2.56, P < 0.05), patients with a PSA2 decreased by ?20% had a lower risk of prostate cancer (OR 0.37, P < 0.05) and high grade disease (OR 0.13, P < 0.05), whilst patients with a PSA2 increased by ?10% had an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (OR 1.93, P < 0.05). When PSA returned to normal values (<4 ng/mL) both risks of prostate cancer and high-grade disease were reduced (OR 0.33 and 0.01, respectively, P = 0.001).CONCLUSION: In a cohort of Italian men undergoing prostate biopsy, a reduction of ?20% in PSA levels significantly reduced the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Further multicentre studies should validate our present results.","['Aged', 'Biopsy, Large-Core Needle', 'Humans', 'Image-Guided Biopsy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Risk Factors', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional']",29533522,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.119.750', 'E01.370.225.998.054.119.750', 'E01.370.388.100.100.750', 'E04.074.119.750', 'E04.665.100.750', 'E05.200.500.384.100.119.750', 'E05.200.998.054.119.750', 'E05.242.384.100.119.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.370', 'E01.370.225.998.054.370', 'E01.370.388.100.370', 'E04.074.370', 'E05.200.500.384.100.370', 'E05.200.998.054.370', 'E05.242.384.100.370'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A05.360.444.575', 'A10.336.707'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.442.750', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.442.750', 'D12.776.866.249.500', 'D23.050.285.625', 'D23.101.140.625'], ['C04.588.945.440.770', 'C12.294.260.750', 'C12.294.565.625', 'C12.758.409.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E01.370.350.850.855', 'E04.502.890']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
4352,Multiple estrogen receptor assays in human breast cancer.,"A review of assay results from more than 6000 patients revealed 232 patients in whom multiple breast cancer specimens were analyzed for estrogen receptor (ER). All assays were performed in a single laboratory. Specimens were considered estrogen receptor positive (ER+) if the ER level was greater than 10 fmol/mg protein and estrogen receptor negative (ER-) if the ER level was less than 3. ER values between 3 and 10 fmol/mg protein were considered borderline. Simultaneous assays were performed in 58 patients with 3% major discordance (i.e., one assay ER- and one assay ER+). Major discordance for sequential biopsies was 19% (16 of 82) when the initial assay was ER+ and 13% (eight of 63) when the initial assay was ER-. (Apparent change from ER- to ER+ status was observed in five of nine patients with primary tumors less than 2 cm in diameter, suggesting that an inadequate amount of tissue may have been submitted for initial ER analysis.) There was no significant relationship between the time interval between sequential biopsies and the rate of discordance. Marked decreases in ER levels and 78% discordance were seen if rebiopsy was performed within 2 months of tamoxifen treatment. When these tamoxifen cases were excluded from the analysis, neither intervening endocrine therapy nor chemotherapy significantly altered discordance rates.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Estrogen']",6847780,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D12.776.826.750.350', 'D12.776.930.778.350']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

However, continuity in the perioperative dialogue provided to be a way out of the suffering by being received by warm hands, being received by a known face and a subtle interplay between the child and nurse.

44563,Fireworks-related injury surveillance in the Philippines: trends in 2010-2014.,"Analysis of the annual fireworks-related injury surveillance data collected by the Philippines Department of Health (DOH) in 2010-2014 was conducted to describe the profile of such injuries in the Philippines. Surveillance data were collected from DOH's Online National Electronic Injury Surveillance System and analysed. A case was defined as any person who had sustained injury from fireworks in any form within the 16-day surveillance period (21 December to 5 January) and had presented to any of the 50 sentinel hospitals. Of the 4649 cases, there were 4706 fireworks-related injuries involving 5076 anatomic sites in 2010-2014. A significant decrease of cases in 2014 was observed when compared with the previous study years (P = 0.02). The number of cases peaked at public holidays. Males (80%) were more commonly injured, and children aged 5 to 14 years were primarily affected (47%). Ignition of illegal fireworks accounted for half (50%) of the injuries; most injuries (68%) occurred in street settings. The majority of injuries (57%) were sustained by fireworks igniters. The most common anatomic injury sites were hands (44%), legs (21%) and eyes (14%). Illegal fireworks were related to 100% (4/4) of the deaths and 49% (105/214) of the cases who needed amputations. Fireworks-related injuries declined significantly in 2014. Public awareness campaigns may have contributed to reducing the injury occurrences. As illegal fireworks accounted for all deaths and more than half of the amputations, law enforcement should be directed towards preventing importing, distributing and using illegal fireworks.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amputation', 'Blast Injuries', 'Burns', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Explosive Agents', 'Female', 'Holidays', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philippines', 'Young Adult']",26798555,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E04.555.080'], ['C26.120.126'], ['C26.200'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D27.720.317'], ['I03.450.345'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.252.145.671', 'Z01.639.790'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
7001,Endocrine changes in maturing primary queens of Zootermopsis angusticollis.,"Termite queens are highly specialized for reproduction, but little is known about the endocrine mechanisms regulating this ability. We studied changes in the endocrinology and ovarian maturation in primary reproductive females of the dampwood termite Zootermopsis angusticollis following their release from inhibitory stimuli produced by mature queens. Winged alates were removed from their natal nest, manually dewinged, then paired in an isolated nest with a reproductive male. Development was tracked by monitoring ovarian development, in vitro rates of juvenile hormone (JH) production by corpora allata, and hemolymph titers of JH and ecdysteroids. The production rate and titer of JH were positively correlated with each other but negatively correlated with ecdysteroid titer. Four days after disinhibition, JH release and titer decreased while ecdysteroid titer increased. The new levels persisted until day 30, after which JH increased and ecdysteroids decreased. Fully mature queens had the highest rates of JH production, the lowest ecdysteroid titers, and the greatest number of functional ovarioles. The results support the hypothesis that JH plays a dual role in termite queens depending on their stage of development; an elevated JH titer in immature alates may maintain reproductive inhibition, but an elevated JH titer in mature queens may stimulate ovarian activity. The decline in JH production and the elevation in ecdysteroid titer correspond to a period of physiological reorganization and activation. The specific function of ecdysteroids is unknown but they may help to modulate the activity of the corpora allata.","['Animals', 'Corpora Allata', 'Ecdysteroids', 'Endocrine System', 'Female', 'Hemolymph', 'Isoptera', 'Juvenile Hormones', 'Male', 'Ovary', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sexual Behavior, Animal']",16081092,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.713.100', 'A13.250'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.265.165', 'D04.210.500.247.808.756.143', 'D06.472.445.573.271', 'D10.570.938.795.143', 'D23.704.500.143'], ['A06'], ['A13.453'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.485'], ['D06.472.445.573.666'], ['A05.360.319.114.630', 'A05.360.576.497', 'A06.300.312.497'], ['G08.686.815'], ['F01.145.113.252.748']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3697,Turbinate-septal suture for middle turbinate medialization: a prospective randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: One of the primary goals of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is to create widely patent paranasal sinus ostia, but lateralization of the middle turbinate (MT) after ESS can obstruct otherwise patent ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of turbinate-septal suturing in preventing lateralization of the MT.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, blinded controlled study.METHODS: The study was performed in 120 patients who had undergone ESS. The patients were randomized to receive nasal (group A) or turbinate-septal suture plus nasal packing (group B). Postoperative lateralization of the MT and synechia formation were assessed as the primary outcome 3 months post-ESS. The Lund-Kennedy Scores at 1 week, 2 week, and 1 month after ESS were assessed as the secondary outcomes.RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were enrolled (60 patients in each group). Group B had a significantly lower rate of MT lateralization compared to group A after 3 months of surgery (6 of 120 sides vs. 19 of 120 sides; P < 0.01). Synechia formation rates in groups B were also significantly lower than those in group A (4 of 120 sides vs. 13 of 120 sides; P = 0.023).CONCLUSION: Middle turbinate-septal suturing medialization during ESS is an effective method for preventing lateralization of the MT.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bandages', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Endoscopy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasal Septum', 'Paranasal Sinuses', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reoperation', 'Rhinitis', 'Sinusitis', 'Suture Techniques', 'Tissue Adhesions', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Turbinates', 'Young Adult']",25041807,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E07.101'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E01.370.388.250', 'E04.502.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A04.531.591'], ['A04.531.621'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E04.690'], ['C01.748.674', 'C08.460.799', 'C08.730.674', 'C09.603.799'], ['C01.748.749', 'C08.460.692.752', 'C08.730.749', 'C09.603.692.752'], ['E04.987.775'], ['C23.550.355.274.840'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.948', 'A04.531.898'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
28517,In-vivo assesment of the genotoxic and oxidative stress effects of particulate matter on Echinogammarus veneris.,"Seven types of atmospheric dusts (road dust, soil dust, brake dust, desert dust, pellet ash and coke and certified material NIST1648a - urban dust) have been tested for their genotoxicity on specimens of Echinogammarus veneris, a small aquatic amphipod. Experiments were carried out in vivo, by exposing the animals for 24 h to water containing 25 mg/L of dust. Each dust has been chemically analyzed for ions, elemental carbon, organic carbon and for the soluble and insoluble fractions of elements. Non-specific damages to DNA have been evaluated by the comet test, while oxidative damages have been estimated by coupling the comet test with formamido pyrimidine DNA glycosylase reaction. The animal tissues have been acid digested and analyzed for their elemental content to evaluate the bioaccumulation. All the considered dusts have caused a significant non-specific DNA damage, while the oxidative stress was shown only by dust types containing high concentration of elements. Furthermore, the oxidative damage has shown a positive correlation with the total bio-accumulated elemental concentration. For all the dust samples, the correlation with bio-accumulation in the tissues was more satisfactory for the insoluble fraction than for the soluble fraction of elements. Elements contained in solid particles seem then to be the main responsible bioaccumulation and for the oxidative stress.","['Air Pollutants', 'Amphipoda', 'Animals', 'DNA Damage', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Particulate Matter']",28107710,"[['D27.888.284.101'], ['B01.050.500.131.365.055'], ['B01.050'], ['G05.200'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D20.633']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7958,A zebrafish vitellogenin gene (vg3) encodes a novel vitellogenin without a phosvitin domain and may represent a primitive vertebrate vitellogenin gene.,"By analysis of zebrafish EST (expressed sequence tag) clones from an adult cDNA library, we have identified 44 clones, about 11% of the adult EST clones, encoding vitellogenins. These vitellogenin EST clones have been derived from at least seven distinct vitellogenin genes. One of the largest vitellogenin cDNA clones, vg3, and its 5' extended clone isolated by 5' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends)-PCR, have been sequenced completely. The deduced complete sequence includes a predicted mature vitellogenin of 1233 amino acids and a truncated signal peptide of 18 amino acids. Interestingly, the predicted vitellogenin has no polyserine phosvitin domain. The lack of the phosvitin domain was confirmed by isolation and sequencing of the vg3 genomic region. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the phosvitinless vitellogenin is an intermediate between invertebrate vitellogenins and all known vertebrate vitellogenins, and thus may represent a primitive vertebrate vitellogenin. Like other vitellogenins in vertebrates, the phosvitinless vitellogenin is also synthesized mainly in the liver and weakly in the intestine.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosvitin', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Vertebrates', 'Vitellogenins', 'Zebrafish']",11054560,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.095', 'E05.301.300.074', 'E05.601.100'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['G05.297'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.776.256.159.157.700', 'D12.776.290.700', 'D12.776.744.700'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['D13.444.735'], ['E05.393.751'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200'], ['G02.111.810.550', 'G05.810.550'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949'], ['B01.050.150.900'], ['D12.776.093.500.925', 'D12.776.290.812.500', 'D12.776.744.925'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.200.244.828']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
35408,"Calculation of NMR relaxation, covolume, and scattering-related properties of bead models using the SOLPRO computer program.","The hydrodynamic properties of macromolecules and bioparticles, represented by bead models, can be calculated using methods implemented in the computer routine HYDRO. Recently, a new computer routine, SOLPRO, has been presented for the calculation of various SOLution PROperties. These include (1) time-dependent electro-optic and spectroscopic properties related to rotational diffusion, (2) non-dynamic properties like scattering curves, and (3) dimensionless quantities that combine two or more solution properties in a form which depends on the shape of the macromolecule but not on its size. In the present work we describe the inclusion of more of those types of properties in a new version of SOLPRO. Particularly, we describe the calculation of relaxation rates in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). For dipolar coupling, given the direction of the dipole the program calculates values of the spectral density, from which the NMR relaxation times can be obtained. We also consider scattering-related properties, namely the distribution of distances for the bead model, which is directly related to the angular dependence of scattered intensity, and the particle's longest distance. We have devised and programmed a procedure to calculate the covolume of the bead model, related to the second virial coefficient and, in general, to the concentration dependence of solution properties. Various shape-dependent dimensionless quantities involving the covolume are calculated. In this paper we also discuss some aspects, namely bead overlapping and hydration, that are not explicitly included in SOLPRO, but should be considered by the user.","['Mathematical Computing', 'Models, Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Software', 'Solutions', 'X-Rays']",10028237,"[['L01.224.680'], ['E05.599.595'], ['E05.318.740.525', 'L01.906.394.422', 'N05.715.360.750.540', 'N06.850.520.830.525'], ['E05.196.867.519.550'], ['E05.196.822', 'G01.867'], ['L01.224.900'], ['D26.776'], ['G01.358.500.505.970', 'G01.750.250.970', 'G01.750.750.918']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
4626,Protein turnover of breast muscle in germ-free and conventional chicks.,"The effect of the gut microflora on protein turnover in pectoral muscle (M. pectoralis profundus) was studied by means of dietary infusion of L-[U-14C]phenylalanine and of massive dose injection of L-[4-3H]phenylalanine in chicks fed on a semi-purified casein-gelatin (SCG) diet until 19 d of age, and in those subsequently given either a nitrogen-free (NF) diet or NF supplemented with methionine and arginine (MA) for a further 9 d. Time-course changes in radioactivity released in expired carbon dioxide during the 8 h infusion period showed that isotopic equilibrium was reached in 4 h with the SCG diet and in 5 h with the MA diet. However, with the protein-deprived chicks given the NF diet, isotopic equilibrium was not achieved since radioactivity in CO2 increased linearly throughout. On feeding the NF diet, fractional protein synthesis rate and the absolute amount of protein synthesized in chick breast muscle were reduced. These reductions were partially alleviated by supplementing the NF diet with methionine and arginine. The fractional degradation rate of breast muscle was increased in chicks given the NF diet, while the absolute amount of protein degraded was decreased. The addition of methionine and arginine counteracted these changes brought about by protein starvation. Generally speaking, the presence of the gut microflora had little, if any, effect on protein turnover rate in chick-breast muscle.","['Animals', 'Arginine', 'Caseins', 'Chickens', 'Diet', 'Gelatin', 'Germ-Free Life', 'Intestines', 'Methionine', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Pectoralis Muscles', 'Phenylalanine']",4063297,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.125.068.050', 'D12.125.095.104', 'D12.125.142.087'], ['D12.776.256.159.750.207', 'D12.776.744.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['D12.776.860.476'], ['G06.320'], ['A03.556.124'], ['D02.886.030.676', 'D12.125.142.557', 'D12.125.154.549', 'D12.125.166.676'], ['D12.776.210.500'], ['A02.633.567.775'], ['D12.125.072.050.685', 'D12.125.142.666']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A total of 22,000 genes were analyzed for expression profiles and functional gene clustering. Ten selected genes differentially expressed in microarray were additionally analyzed by the real-time polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-seven genes were differentially expressed in neonatal rat lungs exposed to intrauterine hyperglycemia when compared to normoglycemic controls (fold change > 1.2, p < 0.001). Functional clustering analysis revealed increased expression in signaling pathways involved with extracellular matrix regulation. The most significantly downregulated functions were cell proliferation, extracellular region, cell adhesion and reactive oxygen species metabolism.CONCLUSION: We found significant hyperglycemia-induced gene expression alterations in neonatal rat pulmonary tissue which may interfere with lung growth and biological signaling pathways.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Lactation', 'Lung', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy in Diabetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Weight Gain']",21051908,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['G04.022'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['C18.452.394.750.074', 'C19.246.240', 'E05.598.500.374'], ['A11.284.295.310'], ['E05.393.332'], ['G05.308.310'], ['C18.452.394.952'], ['G08.686.523', 'G08.686.702.500'], ['A04.411'], ['G08.686.784.769.455'], ['E05.393.661.640', 'E05.393.760.640', 'E05.588.570.660', 'E05.601.640'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C13.703.726'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D01.339.431', 'D01.650.775'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['E05.588.570.850'], ['C23.888.144.243.926', 'G07.345.249.314.120.200.926']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
42632,Optically functional isoxanthopterin crystals in the mirrored eyes of decapod crustaceans.,"The eyes of some aquatic animals form images through reflective optics. Shrimp, lobsters, crayfish, and prawns possess reflecting superposition compound eyes, composed of thousands of square-faceted eye units (ommatidia). Mirrors in the upper part of the eye (the distal mirror) reflect light collected from many ommatidia onto the photosensitive elements of the retina, the rhabdoms. A second reflector, the tapetum, underlying the retina, back-scatters dispersed light onto the rhabdoms. Using microCT and cryo-SEM imaging accompanied by in situ micro-X-ray diffraction and micro-Raman spectroscopy, we investigated the hierarchical organization and materials properties of the reflective systems at high resolution and under close-to-physiological conditions. We show that the distal mirror consists of three or four layers of plate-like nanocrystals. The tapetum is a diffuse reflector composed of hollow nanoparticles constructed from concentric lamellae of crystals. Isoxanthopterin, a pteridine analog of guanine, forms both the reflectors in the distal mirror and in the tapetum. The crystal structure of isoxanthopterin was determined from crystal-structure prediction calculations and verified by comparison with experimental X-ray diffraction. The extended hydrogen-bonded layers of the molecules result in an extremely high calculated refractive index in the H-bonded plane, n = 1.96, which makes isoxanthopterin crystals an ideal reflecting material. The crystal structure of isoxanthopterin, together with a detailed knowledge of the reflector superstructures, provide a rationalization of the reflective optics of the crustacean eye.","['Animals', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Decapoda', 'Nanoparticles', 'Photoreceptor Cells', 'Retina', 'Xanthopterin']",29463710,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.309.742.225'], ['B01.050.500.131.365.190'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['A08.675.650.850.625', 'A08.675.650.915.937', 'A08.800.950.937', 'A09.371.729.831.625', 'A11.671.650.850.625', 'A11.671.650.915.937'], ['A09.371.729'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.825', 'D23.767.831.742']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
8375,"Effect of charcoal amendment on adsorption, leaching and degradation of isoproturon in soils.","The effects of charcoal amendment on adsorption, leaching and degradation of the herbicide isoproturon in soils were studied under laboratory conditions. The adsorption data all fitted well with the Freundlich empirical equation. It was found that the adsorption of isoproturon in soils increased with the rate of charcoal amended (correlation coefficient r=0.957**, P<0.01). The amount of isoproturon in leachate decreased with the increase of the amount of charcoal addition to soil column, while the retention of isoproturon in soils increased with an increase in the charcoal content of soil samples. Biodegradation was still the most significant mechanism for isoproturon dissipation from soil. Charcoal amendment greatly reduced the biodegradation of isoproturon in soils. The half-lives of isoproturon degradation (DT(50)) in soils greatly extended when the rate of added charcoal increased from 0 to 50 g kg(-1) (for Paddy soil, DT(50) values increased from 54.6 to 71.4 days; for Alfisol, DT(50) from 16.0 to 136 days; and for Vertisol, DT(50) from 15.2 to 107 days). The degradation rate of isoproturon in soils was significantly negatively correlated with the amount of added charcoal. This research suggests that charcoal amendment may be an effective management practice for reducing pesticide leaching and enhancing its persistence in soils.","['Adsorption', 'Charcoal', 'Herbicides', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Soil Pollutants']",21237529,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['D01.268.150.150'], ['D27.720.031.700.366', 'D27.888.723.366'], ['D02.065.950.681', 'D02.455.426.559.389.703'], ['D27.888.284.756']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33971,Mechanism of action of arginine vasopressin on acute ischemic brain edema.,"The purpose of this experiment is to study the role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in acute cerebral ischemic edema in Mongolian gerbils. The results show that intracerebroventricular injection (ICV) of AVP exacerbates acute ischemic brain edema, while ICV of AVP antiserum significantly decreases the ischemic brain edema. Nimodipine (calcium antagonist) cannot block this role of AVP in brain edema. In addition, the cortical Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity is significantly decreased, while the cAMP content of ischemic cortex and hypothalamus and the cGMP content of the hypothalamus are markedly increased after AVP ICV. These suggest that AVP may play an important role in the pathophysiologic process of ischemic brain edema by inhibiting the Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity of the cerebral cell membrane and the AVP receptors mediated by cAMP and cGMP.","['Animals', 'Arginine Vasopressin', 'Brain', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Female', 'Gerbillinae', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Male', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase']",1651829,"[['B01.050'], ['D06.472.699.631.692.781.100', 'D12.644.400.900.100', 'D12.644.456.925.100', 'D12.644.548.691.692.781.100', 'D12.776.631.650.937.100'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C10.228.140.187'], ['C10.228.140.300.150', 'C14.907.253.092'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.454.160', 'D13.695.462.275', 'D13.695.667.454.160', 'D13.695.827.426.160'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.300'], ['E02.319.267.530.550'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.750', 'D12.776.157.530.450.162.780', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.880', 'D12.776.157.530.813.750', 'D12.776.543.585.450.162.800', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.890', 'D12.776.543.585.813.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7320,Effect of posterior temporal-parietal hematoma on orbital frontal chemistry in relation to a cognitive and anxiety state: a combined 1H-MRS and neuropsychological study of an unusual case as compared with 16 healthy subjects.,"The authors report the unusual case of a 58-year-old woman (MJP) suffering from left temporal throbbing headache, associated with confusion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 5 x 3 x 2 cm hematoma at the left posterior temporal--parietal junction (PTPJ). Repeated MRI of MJP's brain performed during a 4-month follow-up period showed decrease in hematoma size (2.3 x 1.5 x 1) with evidence for development of encephalomalacia and resorption of blood products involving the area of hemorrhage. MJP had mild transcortical sensory aphasia characterized by difficulty with reading and processing, with semantic paraphasic errors while speaking and some difficulty with repetition. MJP had remained normotensive and seizure free, on Vasotec therapy and Dilantin prophylaxis. An in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) performed during an 8-month follow-up period showed reduced concentration for N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) by 19.3% (F=4.09, P<0.04), and myo-inositol by 32.0% (F=5.16, P<0.02) in the left orbital frontal cortex (OFC) as compared with 16 healthy subjects (age- and sex-matched). Cognitive tests (the Wechsler abbreviated scale of intelligence (WASI) and the Stroop color--word interference) showed a significant impairment suggesting involvement of higher-order cognitive functioning (memory, learning, and general intelligence) and attentional system. The Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) showed increased anxiety at the moment of the current examination and decreased tendency to be anxious over a long period of time. The Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory revealed minimal anxiety and mild to moderate levels of depression. It is hypothesized that the PTPJ hematoma triggered long-distance pathways linking PTPJ area and frontal lobe, including OFC, which resulted in abnormal chemical changes in the left OFC and in cognitive tests impairment, and in long-term anxiety state changes.","['Anxiety', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Confusion', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Headache', 'Hematoma', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Orbit', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Temporal Lobe']",11861128,"[['F01.470.132'], ['F03.615.250'], ['C10.597.606.337', 'C23.888.592.604.339', 'F01.700.250'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['C23.888.592.612.441'], ['C23.550.414.838'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.711.513'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.690'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.670'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.863']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
28467,Experimental study on slow-speed elongation injury of the peripheral nerve: electrophysiological and histological changes.,"Slow-speed elongation of the sciatic nerves was induced in 41 rabbits by lengthening the osteotomized femur by 2.1 mm/day with an external fixator. Time courses were monitored. About 2 weeks after elongation began, the amplitude of the compound nerve action potentials decreased, and delayed latency began. Histological observations showed that the wavy structure of the nerve fibers was lost during the stage at which reduction in the amplitude of action potentials occurred. In some nerve fibers, narrowing of the axons was observed. Further elongation caused delay in the percent latency. Histologically, collagen fibers were noted in the nerve fascicles, as well as narrowing in all the nerve fibers. When elongation ceased at the stage at which a reduction in the amplitude of action potential was noted, recovery from nerve damage followed. When elongation did not cease until the stage at which latency was delayed, however, recovery was not apparent, either histologically or electrophysiologically. The critical level of percent amplitude for recovery was at 82.4% of the original level (the critical rate for bone lengthening was 20.5%).","['Action Potentials', 'Animals', 'Bone Lengthening', 'Electrophysiology', 'Female', 'Neural Conduction', 'Rabbits', 'Sciatic Nerve']",11484121,"[['G04.580.100', 'G07.265.675.100', 'G11.561.570.100'], ['B01.050'], ['E04.555.120'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['G07.265.753', 'G11.561.601'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['A08.800.800.720.450.760']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
568,High autophagy in the naked mole rat may play a significant role in maintaining good health.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The maximum lifespan of the naked mole rat is over 28.3 years, which exceeds that of any other rodent species, suggesting that age-related changes in its body composition and functionality are either attenuated or delayed in this extraordinarily long-lived species. However, the mechanisms underlying the aging process in this species are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether long-lived naked mole rats display more autophagic activity than short-lived mice.METHODS: Hepatic stellate cells isolated from naked mole rats were treated with 50 nM rapamycin or 20 mM 3-methyladenine (3-MA) for 12 or 24 h. Expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC3-II and beclin 1 was measured with western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The induction of apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that one-day-old naked mole rats have higher levels of autophagy than one-day-old short-lived C57BL/6 mice, and that both adult naked mole rats (eight months old) and adult C57BL/6 mice (eight weeks old) have high basal levels of autophagy, which may be an important mechanism inhibiting aging and reducing the risk of age-related diseases.CONCLUSION: Here, we report that autophagy facilitated the survival of hepatic stellate cells from the naked mole rat, and that treatment with 3-MA or rapamycin increased the ratio of apoptotic cells to normal hepatic stellate cells.","['Adenine', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Autophagy', 'Hepatic Stellate Cells', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Longevity', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Mole Rats', 'Sirolimus']",24525846,"[['D03.633.100.759.138'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.644.360.075', 'D12.776.476.075'], ['G04.011'], ['A11.561'], ['D27.505.696.477.656'], ['G07.345.124.519', 'G07.540'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.776.220.600.450', 'D12.776.631.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.600'], ['D02.540.505.760']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
12357,"Synergistic influence of epidermal growth factor, insulin and transferrin on human fetal kidney in culture.","In human fetal kidneys (15-21 weeks of gestation) maintained in serum-free organ culture, protein synthesis remained relatively constant, but DNA synthesis decreased dramatically after 2 days. The addition of transferrin alone had no influence, but insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) both significantly stimulated DNA and protein synthesis. When supplemented in combination, transferrin strongly potentiated the insulin effect and after 5 days of culture DNA synthesis was practically restored to values observed in control uncultured renal explants (day 0). When EGF, a potent mitogen, was added as a third factor, the stimulating effectiveness of the (insulin plus transferrin) combination was significantly reduced. However, EGF had no such inhibiting influence on protein synthesis. Differentiation of brush border membranes, as evaluated by hydrolase activities, was not importantly induced nor retarded by any of the three factors supplemented either alone or in combination. The present results indicate that the individual effects of the three factors are not additive, but suggest that they rather act synergistically through a complex mechanism of receptor cross-talk. In our laboratory, there is convincing indication that the response of fetal organs varies according to age, proliferative state of tissues as well as stage of differentiation.","['DNA', 'Epidermal Growth Factor', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Insulin', 'Kidney', 'Microvilli', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Transferrin']",1910452,"[['D13.444.308'], ['D06.472.317.350', 'D12.644.276.382.500', 'D12.776.467.382.500', 'D23.529.382.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.380'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['A05.810.453'], ['A11.284.180.565'], ['E05.481.500.484'], ['G02.111.660.871', 'G03.734.871', 'G05.297.670'], ['D12.776.124.050.800', 'D12.776.124.790.223.839', 'D12.776.157.427.750.500', 'D12.776.377.715.182.839', 'D12.776.556.579.750.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9165,The evolution of the marine phosphate reservoir.,"Phosphorus is a biolimiting nutrient that has an important role in regulating the burial of organic matter and the redox state of the ocean-atmosphere system. The ratio of phosphorus to iron in iron-oxide-rich sedimentary rocks can be used to track dissolved phosphate concentrations if the dissolved silica concentration of sea water is estimated. Here we present iron and phosphorus concentration ratios from distal hydrothermal sediments and iron formations through time to study the evolution of the marine phosphate reservoir. The data suggest that phosphate concentrations have been relatively constant over the Phanerozoic eon, the past 542 million years (Myr) of Earth's history. In contrast, phosphate concentrations seem to have been elevated in Precambrian oceans. Specifically, there is a peak in phosphorus-to-iron ratios in Neoproterozoic iron formations dating from ?750 to ?635 Myr ago, indicating unusually high dissolved phosphate concentrations in the aftermath of widespread, low-latitude 'snowball Earth' glaciations. An enhanced postglacial phosphate flux would have caused high rates of primary productivity and organic carbon burial and a transition to more oxidizing conditions in the ocean and atmosphere. The snowball Earth glaciations and Neoproterozoic oxidation are both suggested as triggers for the evolution and radiation of metazoans. We propose that these two factors are intimately linked; a glacially induced nutrient surplus could have led to an increase in atmospheric oxygen, paving the way for the rise of metazoan life.","['Animals', 'Aquatic Organisms', 'Atmosphere', 'Biological Evolution', 'Ferric Compounds', 'Geologic Sediments', 'History, Ancient', 'Ice Cover', 'Iron', 'Marine Biology', 'Oceans and Seas', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen', 'Phosphates', 'Phosphorus', 'Seawater', 'Silicon Dioxide']",20981096,"[['B01.050'], ['B05.080', 'G16.500.275.725.500.650.075'], ['G16.500.275.063', 'N06.230.300.100'], ['G05.045', 'G16.075'], ['D01.490.100'], ['G01.311.330', 'G16.500.320'], ['K01.400.470'], ['G01.311.400', 'G16.500.275.410.500', 'N06.230.291.500'], ['D01.268.556.412', 'D01.268.956.287', 'D01.552.544.412'], ['H01.158.273.248.750.500', 'H01.277.249.750.500', 'H01.277.750.500'], ['G01.311.625', 'G16.500.275.725.500.650', 'Z01.756'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374', 'D01.248.497.158.730', 'D01.695.625.675.650'], ['D01.268.666'], ['G16.500.275.725.500'], ['D01.578.750', 'D01.650.550.825', 'D01.837.725']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

34245,The lipid lowering drug lovastatin protects against doxorubicin-induced hepatotoxicity.,"Liver is the main detoxifying organ and therefore the target of high concentrations of genotoxic compounds, such as environmental carcinogens and anticancer drugs. Here, we investigated the usefulness of lovastatin, which is nowadays widely used for lipid lowering purpose, as a hepatoprotective drug following the administration of the anthracycline derivative doxorubicin in vivo. To this end, BALB/c mice were exposed to either a single high dose or three consecutive low doses of doxorubicin. Acute and subacute hepatotoxicities were analyzed with or without lovastatin co-treatment. Lovastatin protected the liver against doxorubicin-induced acute pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic stress responses as indicated by an attenuated mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFá) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), respectively. Hepatoprotection by lovastatin was due to a reduced induction of DNA damage following doxorubicin treatment. The statin also mitigated subacute anthracycline-provoked hepatotoxicity as shown on the level of doxorubicin- and epirubicin-stimulated CTGF mRNA expression as well as histopathologically detectable fibrosis and serum concentration of marker enzymes of hepatotoxicity (GPT/GLDH). Kidney damage following doxorubicin exposure was not detectable under our experimental conditions.Moreover, lovastatin showed multiple inhibitory effects on doxorubicin-triggered hepatic expression of genes involved in oxidative stress response, drug transport, DNA repair, cell cycle progression and cell death. Doxorubicin also stimulated the formation of ceramides. Ceramide production, however, was not blocked by lovastatin, indicating that hepatoprotection by lovastatin is independent of the sphingolipid metabolism. Overall, the data show that lovastatin is hepatoprotective following genotoxic stress induced by anthracyclines.

3223,Alanine transaminase levels in the year before pregnancy predict the risk of hepatitis C virus vertical transmission.,"Vertical transmission is the most common route of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in children. Transmission risk factors have been described, but most risk factors can only be evaluated using expensive laboratory exams. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether maternal alanine transaminase (ALT) levels before pregnancy correlate with HCV vertical transmission. Seventy-four transmitting and 403 nontransmitting mothers were evaluated. All mothers enrolled had two ALT determinations in the last year before pregnancy, at least 6 months apart. Mothers were divided into two groups: mothers with persistently normal serum ALT levels and mothers with abnormal ALT levels. In the second group both mothers with constantly raised or with fluctuating ALT levels (one normal and one raised determination) were included. ALT was defined as raised if higher than twice the upper limit of normal. Abnormal ALT levels were found in 39/74 (52.7%) HCV transmitting mothers and in 146/403 (32.6%) nontransmitting mothers (P = 0.008; relative risk 1.96; 95% confidence limits 1.19-3.23). The risk of transmission from mothers with constantly raised ALT levels was more evident than that from mothers with fluctuating ALT levels. Increased ALT levels may reflect a more severe liver disease and a higher viral load, factors known to be associated with vertical transmission. ALT determination, a simple, widely available and inexpensive test, may help in identifying mothers with an increased risk of HCV vertical transmission.","['Alanine Transaminase', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hepatitis A Antibodies', 'Hepatitis C', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'RNA, Viral', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",16721858,"[['D08.811.913.477.700.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254.450.251', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254.450.251', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254.450.251'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['N06.850.335.875'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C01.674', 'C13.703.700'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

33991,Perturbation of cranial neural crest migration by the HNK-1 antibody.,"The HNK-1 antibody recognizes a carbohydrate moiety that is shared by a family of cell adhesion molecules and is also present on the surface of migrating neural crest cells. Here, the effects of the HNK-1 antibody on neural crest cells were examined in vitro and in vivo. When the HNK-1 antibody was added to neural tube explants in tissue culture, neural crest cells detached from laminin substrates but were unaffected on fibronectin substrates. In order to examine the effects of the HNK-1 antibody in vivo, antibody was injected lateral to the mesencephalic neural tube at the onset of cranial neural crest migration. The injected antibody persisted for approximately 16 hr on the injected side of the embryo and appeared to be most prevalent on the surface of neural crest cells. Embryos fixed within the first 24 hr after injection of HNK-1 antibodies (either whole IgMs or small IgM fragments) showed one or more of the following abnormalities: (1) ectopic neural crest cells external to the neural tube, (2) an accumulation of neural crest cell volume on the lumen of the neural tube, (3) some neural tube anomalies, or (4) a reduction in the neural crest cell volume on the injected side. The ectopic cells and neural tube anomalies persisted in embryos fixed 2 days postinjection. Only embryos having 10 or less somites at the time of injection were affected, suggesting a limited period of sensitivity to the HNK-1 antibody. Control embryos injected with a nonspecific antibody or with a nonblocking antibody against the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) were unaffected. Previous experiments from this laboratory have demonstrated than an antibody against integrin, a fibronectin and laminin receptor caused defects qualitatively similar to those resulting from HNK-1 antibody injection (M. Bronner-Fraser, J. Cell Biol., 101, 610, 1985). Coinjection of the HNK-1 and integrin antibodies resulted in a greater percentage of affected embryos than with either antibody alone. The additive nature of the effects of the two antibodies suggests that they act at different sites. These results demonstrate that the HNK-1 antibody causes abnormalities in cranial neural crest migration, perhaps by perturbing interactions between neural crest cells and laminin substrates.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Brain', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Movement', 'Coturnix', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Mesencephalon', 'Neural Crest']",3653510,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['D23.050.301'], ['A08.186.211'], ['G04.022'], ['D12.776.395.550.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200', 'D23.050.301.350'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.650.350'], ['A13.350', 'A16.331'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.574', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.574', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.574'], ['A08.186.211.132.659'], ['A16.627']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To explore the risk factors for NTDs in Shanxi province, we carried out a population-based case-control study in four selected counties with prevalence rates >10 per 1000 births during 2003. Using a multi-logistic regression model analysis (alpha = 0.10), 158 NTD cases were compared with 226 control mothers. Maternal factors significantly associated with increased risk for an NTD were a primary school education or lower (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 4.97); a history of a previous birth defect-affected pregnancy (adjusted OR 5.27, 95% CI 0.98, 28.37); history of a fever or 'cold' (adjusted OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.68, 6.72); use of analgesic and antipyretic drugs (adjusted OR 4.89, 95% CI 0.92, 25.97); daily passive exposure to cigarette smoke (adjusted OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.94, 2.73); poor ventilation during heating (adjusted OR 3.91, 95% CI 0.75, 20.81); and consumption of >or= six meals per week containing pickled vegetables (adjusted OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.11, 13.47) during pregnancy. Factors which appeared to be protective were meat consumption one to three times per week (adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37, 1.06), or >or= four times per week (adjusted OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11, 0.77); and legume consumption >or= six times per week (adjusted OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17, 0.89). Differences in risk were found between the two most common phenotypes, anencephaly and spina bifida. Most of the environmental factors had stronger positive and negative associations with risk for anencephaly rather than spina bifida, whereas history of a previous birth defect-associated pregnancy, as well as legume consumption, were more strongly associated with the risk for spina bifida than for anencephaly.

32074,Metabolic profiles of the Flos Abelmoschus manihot extract by intestinal bacteria from the normal and CKD model rats based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS.,"Flos Abelmoschus manihot is a traditional herbal medicine widely used in clinical practice to tackle chronic kidney disease (CKD) for thousands of years. Nowadays, many studies indicate that gut bacteria are closely related to the progression of CKD and CKD-related complications. In this study, a UPLC-Q-TOF/MS method coupled with the MetaboLynx™ software was established and successfully applied to investigate the metabolites and metabolic profile of Flos A. manihot extract by intestinal bacteria from normal and CKD rats. Eight parent components and eight metabolites were characterized by their protonated ions. Among these compounds, 15 were detected in the two group samples while M16 was only determined in the CKD model samples. Compared with the quercetin-type glycosides, fewer myricetin-type and gossypetin-type metabolites were obtained in the two group samples. These metabolites suggested that deglycosylation and methylation are the major metabolic pathways of Flos A. manihot extract. Few differences of metabolite classes were observed in the two group samples. However, the concentrations of aglycones such as quercetin, myricetin and gossypetin in the normal samples were notably higher than those in the CKD model samples. The results are important in unravelling the pharmacological effects of A. manihot and clarifying its mechanism of action in vivo.","['Abelmoschus', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Flavonoids', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestines', 'Male', 'Malvaceae', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolome', 'Quercetin', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic']",27451133,"[['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.821.500.100'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D20.215.784.500.350', 'D26.335'], ['D03.383.663.283.266.450', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['A03.556.124'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.821.500'], ['E05.196.566'], ['G03.500'], ['D03.383.663.283.266.450.284.777', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.284.777'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['C12.777.419.780.750', 'C13.351.968.419.780.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
48587,Functional characterization of muscarinic receptors in murine airways.,"1. The effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists considered to be selective for M1 receptors (pirenzepine; PZ), M2 receptors (AFDX-116), and for M3 receptors (4-diphenyl acetoxy N-methyl-piperidine (4-DAMP)) were used to investigate the existence of muscarinic receptors subtypes in murine airways. Atropine was used as a nonselective antagonist. The effects of these antagonists were studied upon tracheal contractions induced either by EFS (electric field stimulation) or by application of an exogenous cholinoceptor agonist (arecoline). 2. The muscarinic receptor antagonists tested inhibited arecoline-induced tracheal contractions with the following rank order of potency: 4-DAMP = atropine > pirenzepine = AFDX-116. The rank order of potency of the muscarinic antagonists used in inhibiting EFS-induced tracheal contractions was: 4-DAMP = atropine > PZ > AFDX-116. The pA2 values for these antagonists were similar when compared to the pA2 values determined in guinea-pig and bovine airway smooth muscle. 3. In addition to in vitro studies, the effects of inhalation of the different muscarinic antagonists on lung function parameters in vivo were investigated. Inhalation of 4-DAMP induced a decrease in airway resistance and an increase in lung compliance. In contrast, inhalation of AFDX-116 induced an increase in airway resistance and almost no change in lung compliance. Apart from some minor effects of atropine on airway resistance, atropine, PZ, and pilocarpine failed to induce changes in lung mechanics as determined by in vivo lung function measurements. 4. The results provide evidence for the existence of M3 receptors on murine tracheae that are involved in the contraction of tracheal smooth muscle. This is in agreement with other animal species such as the guinea-pig and bovine. In vivo experiments also demonstrated that in the mouse, M3 receptors play an important role in bronchial smooth muscle contraction and thus in bronchoconstriction. Interestingly we have also demonstrated that M2 receptors can play a role in bronchodilatation. Inhalation of an M2 receptor antagonist induced an increase in airway resistance whereas inhalation of an M3 receptor antagonist induced a decrease in airway resistance. It is therefore likely that an M3/M2 receptor balance plays an important role in the regulation of airway function.","['Administration, Inhalation', 'Airway Resistance', 'Animals', 'Atropine', 'Bronchi', 'Electric Stimulation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Lung Compliance', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Smooth', 'Parasympatholytics', 'Parasympathomimetics', 'Piperidines', 'Pirenzepine', 'Receptors, Muscarinic', 'Trachea']",8495246,"[['E02.319.267.050'], ['E01.370.386.700.050', 'G09.772.060'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.145.074.722.229.199', 'D03.132.760.180.572.199', 'D03.132.889.180.648.199', 'D03.605.084.500.722.229.199', 'D03.605.869.229.199'], ['A04.411.125'], ['E05.723.402'], ['E05.481'], ['G11.427.494.472'], ['E01.370.386.700.475', 'G09.772.540'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['G11.427.494'], ['A02.633.570', 'A10.690.467'], ['D27.505.696.663.050.650'], ['D27.505.696.663.050.675'], ['D03.383.621'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.070.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.475', 'D12.776.543.750.720.360.500'], ['A04.889']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
21537,Lipidomic analysis of meibomian gland secretions from the tree shrew: Identification of candidate tear lipids critical for reducing evaporation.,"Lipids secreted from the meibomian glands form the outermost layer of the tear film and reduce its evaporation. Abnormal changes in the quantities or compositions of lipids present in meibomian gland secretions (meibum) are known to lead to dry eye disease, although the underlying mechanism is not yet well understood. The tree shrew is the non-primate mammal most closely related to humans. To assess the utility of the tree shrew as a model for the study of dry eye disease, we analyzed the lipid profile of tree shrew meibum using an untargeted ESI-MS and MS/MSall shotgun approach. The resulting lipidome shared many similarities with human meibum, while displaying some interesting differences. For example, several classes of lipids, including wax esters, cholesteryl esters, diesters, and (O-acyl)-ù-hydroxy fatty acids, had relatively longer chain lengths in tree shrew meibum. These increases in length may promote more effective reduction of tear evaporation in the tree shrew, which likely underlies the much longer blinking interval of this mammal. Our results suggest that the tree shrew could be an effective model for the study of dry eye.","['Animals', 'Eyelids', 'Female', 'Lipidomics', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Meibomian Glands', 'Tears', 'Tupaiidae', 'Volatilization']",30660743,"[['B01.050'], ['A01.456.505.420.504', 'A09.371.337'], ['H01.158.201.586.500', 'H01.158.273.180.599.500', 'H01.181.122.638.500'], ['D10'], ['E05.196.566'], ['A09.371.337.614', 'A10.336.827.600'], ['A12.200.882'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.996.770'], ['G01.645.750', 'G02.734.933']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
15742,Tramadol added to lidocaine for intravenous regional anesthesia.,"UNLABELLED: Sixty volunteers, divided into four groups of 15 each, received IV regional anesthesia of the upper limb with 40 mL tramadol 0.25%, sodium chloride 0.9%, lidocaine 0.5%, or 100 mg tramadol-containing lidocaine 0.5%. By using a double-blinded method, we tested the onset and recovery of sensory block at six sites of the forearm and hand as well as onset of complete motor block. The symptoms after deflation of the tourniquet were recorded. The onset and recovery of sensory block and the onset of motor block were similar in the tramadol and saline groups. However, in the Tramadol-Lidocaine Group, the speed of onset of sensory block was faster than in the Lidocaine Group. In the Tramadol and the Tramadol-Lidocaine Groups, the incidence of skin rash and painful or burning sensation at the injection site was increased. We conclude that tramadol 0.25% does not have a local anesthetic effect when used as a sole drug for IV regional anesthesia, but might modify the action of local anesthetic, providing a shorter onset time of sensory block.IMPLICATIONS: Tramadol, a centrally acting analgesic, might have local anesthetic properties, as do some opioid drugs. We demonstrated that 0.25% tramadol solution containing 100 mg tramadol is not effective as a sole drug, but may improve the action of 0.5% lidocaine for intravenous regional anesthesia. The increased incidence of side effects may limit the clinical use of tramadol.","['Adult', 'Analgesics, Opioid', 'Anesthesia, Conduction', 'Anesthesia, Intravenous', 'Anesthetics, Combined', 'Anesthetics, Local', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Forearm', 'Hand', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Lidocaine', 'Male', 'Tramadol']",11133629,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.696.277.600.500', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.760.500', 'D27.505.954.427.040.550.500', 'D27.505.954.427.210.600.500'], ['E03.155.086'], ['E03.155.308'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.017', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.017'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['G07.690.773.968.477'], ['A01.378.800.585'], ['A01.378.800.667'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.082.750', 'E02.319.267.530.540'], ['D02.065.199.092.500', 'D02.092.146.113.092.500'], ['D02.033.415.510.500.802', 'D02.092.668.387.750', 'D10.289.510.500.802']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
42991,Giardiasis in dairy calves: effects of fenbendazole treatment on intestinal structure and function.,"Twelve Giardia duodenalis-infected Holstein dairy calves were allocated into a treatment (n=6) and placebo group (n=6) according to pre-study faecal cyst counts. Calves in the treatment group received an oral dose of 5 mg/kg fenbendazole once daily for 3 days, while placebo calves received a sterile saline solution. Calves were euthanised 7 days following the initiation of treatment and intestinal were collected and prepared for trophozoite quantitation, histology, electron microscopy, and disaccharidase assays. In all calves treated with fenbendazole, intestinal trophozoites were below detection limits, while in saline-treated calves, trophozoites were observed in all intestinal segments. Histologically, no significant difference was observed between treatment groups with respect to intestinal villus height or crypt depth. However, a significant decline in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) was observed in fenbendazole-treated calves when compared with placebo-treated calves in the duodenum (13.9+/-1.2 vs. 17.0+/-1.1 IEL/100 enterocytes) and jejunum (21.6+/-0.8 vs. 30.7+/-1.0 IEL/100 enterocytes). In addition, measurements from TEM micrographs demonstrated a significant increase in microvillus surface area in the jejunum of fenbendazole-treated calves compared with saline-treated calves (31.2+/-10.2 vs. 22.8+/-7.6 microm(2)). This increase in microvillus surface area was also associated with an increase in jejunal maltase activity in fenbendazole-treated calves compared with calves treated with saline. These results demonstrate that fenbendazole is an effective treatment for giardiasis in calves. fenbendazole treatment eliminated Giardia trophozoites from the small intestine of calves resulting in increased microvillus surface area and greater intestinal enzyme activity. This study also demonstrates that the pathogenesis of giardiasis in calves is similar to that observed in humans and laboratory animals, and provides further evidence that Giardia is a pathogen of cattle with potential economic importance.","['Animals', 'Antinematodal Agents', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases', 'Dairying', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fenbendazole', 'Giardia lamblia', 'Giardiasis', 'Intestines', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",11165274,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.250.075.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['C22.196'], ['J01.040.246'], ['E02.319.283'], ['D02.241.081.251.320', 'D03.633.100.103.450'], ['B01.237.385.400'], ['C01.610.432.481', 'C01.610.752.400', 'C06.405.469.452.481'], ['A03.556.124'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
42280,Binding of photobilirubin to human serum albumin. Estimate of the affinity constant.,"Results of experiments based upon circular dichroic spectra suggest that configurationally (Z leads to E) isomerized bilirubin (photobilirubin) binds to human serum albumin at the primary bilirubin binding site with an affinity only 2-3 times lower than that of bilirubin. The high affinity of photobilirubin for albumin, comparable to that of bilirubin, supports the roles of albumin in the stabilization and transport of the isomerized pigment in vivo and strongly suggests that albumin also functions to sequester photobilirubin effectively, reducing its toxic potential. The high affinity of photobilirubin for albumin predicts that the isomerized pigment, formed in large amounts during phototherapy for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, should not appear in the fast-diazo-reacting ('direct') bilirubin pool nor should it interfere with nonspectroscopic bilirubin binding tests. These predictions were confirmed for the Evelyn and Malloy diazo assay for 'direct' bilirubin and a Sephadex chromatography method for assessing 'loosely bound' plasma bilirubin.","['Bilirubin', 'Binding Sites', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Serum Albumin', 'Stereoisomerism']",6840080,"[['D03.383.129.578.840.249.184', 'D03.633.400.909.249.184', 'D04.345.783.249.184', 'D23.767.193.184'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['E05.196.867.151'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D12.776.034.841', 'D12.776.124.727'], ['G02.607.445.682']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
29916,Defect interactions and ionic transport in scandia stabilized zirconia.,"Classical molecular dynamics simulation has been used to study ionic transport in scandia-stabilized zirconia, as well as scandia and yttria-co-doped zirconia, as a function of temperature and composition. The oxygen diffusion coefficient shows a peak at a composition of 6 mol% Sc(2)O(3). At 1125 K and higher temperatures, oxygen vacancies prefer to be second nearest neighbours to yttrium ions and first neighbours to scandium ions, because the defect interactions in scandia-stabilized zirconia are governed mainly by electrostatic effects. Oxygen migration between cation tetrahedra is impeded less effectively by Sc-Sc edges than by Y-Y edges. The formation of neutral dopant-anion vacancy clusters is favoured, in agreement with recent nuclear magnetic resonance observations.","['Computer Simulation', 'Ion Transport', 'Ions', 'Models, Molecular', 'Scandium', 'Thermodynamics', 'Zirconium']",19551221,"[['L01.224.160'], ['G03.143.500'], ['D01.248.497'], ['E05.599.595'], ['D01.268.558.800', 'D01.268.956.827', 'D01.552.550.800'], ['G01.906'], ['D01.268.556.950', 'D01.268.956.937', 'D01.552.544.950']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
9798,Efficient genome ancestry inference in complex pedigrees with inbreeding.,"MOTIVATION: High-density SNP data of model animal resources provides opportunities for fine-resolution genetic variation studies. These genetic resources are generated through a variety of breeding schemes that involve multiple generations of matings derived from a set of founder animals. In this article, we investigate the problem of inferring the most probable ancestry of resulting genotypes, given a set of founder genotypes. Due to computational difficulty, existing methods either handle only small pedigree data or disregard the pedigree structure. However, large pedigrees of model animal resources often contain repetitive substructures that can be utilized in accelerating computation.RESULTS: We present an accurate and efficient method that can accept complex pedigrees with inbreeding in inferring genome ancestry. Inbreeding is a commonly used process in generating genetically diverse and reproducible animals. It is often carried out for many generations and can account for most of the computational complexity in real-world model animal pedigrees. Our method builds a hidden Markov model that derives the ancestry probabilities through inbreeding process without explicit modeling in every generation. The ancestry inference is accurate and fast, independent of the number of generations, for model animal resources such as the Collaborative Cross (CC). Experiments on both simulated and real CC data demonstrate that our method offers comparable accuracy to those methods that build an explicit model of the entire pedigree, but much better scalability with respect to the pedigree size.","['Animals', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Inbreeding', 'Pedigree', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",20529906,"[['B01.050'], ['G05.365'], ['G05.360.340'], ['H01.158.273.180.350', 'H01.158.273.343.350'], ['G05.380'], ['E05.820.150.520', 'G05.090.403'], ['E05.393.673'], ['G05.365.795.598']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
3211,PatMatch: a program for finding patterns in peptide and nucleotide sequences.,"Here, we present PatMatch, an efficient, web-based pattern-matching program that enables searches for short nucleotide or peptide sequences such as cis-elements in nucleotide sequences or small domains and motifs in protein sequences. The program can be used to find matches to a user-specified sequence pattern that can be described using ambiguous sequence codes and a powerful and flexible pattern syntax based on regular expressions. A recent upgrade has improved performance and now supports both mismatches and wildcards in a single pattern. This enhancement has been achieved by replacing the previous searching algorithm, scan_for_matches [D'Souza et al. (1997), Trends in Genetics, 13, 497-498], with nondeterministic-reverse grep (NR-grep), a general pattern matching tool that allows for approximate string matching [Navarro (2001), Software Practice and Experience, 31, 1265-1312]. We have tailored NR-grep to be used for DNA and protein searches with PatMatch. The stand-alone version of the software can be adapted for use with any sequence dataset and is available for download at The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) at ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Software/Patmatch/.

26510,Stress-induced impairment of inhibitory avoidance learning in female neuromedin B receptor-deficient mice.,"Neuromedin B (NMB) is a mammalian bombesin (BN)-like peptide that exerts its function via the neuromedin B receptor (NMB-R). The NMB/NMB-R system is involved in stress response, and therefore we examined behavioral properties in female mice lacking NMB-R using a restraint-induced stress paradigm. Thirty minutes of restraint in a wire mesh cage constituted a sufficient stress stimulus for mice as evidenced by elevated blood glucose concentrations in stressed wild-type and NMB-R-deficient mice. Using a one-trial passive avoidance test, stressed NMB-R-deficient mice exhibited a marked reduction in memory performance. NMB-R-deficient mice exhibited elevated spontaneous activity in a novel environment compared to non-stressed mutant mice after 30-min stress, and a similar difference was also observed between stressed/non-stressed wild-type mice. An elevated plus maze test showed that the stress stimulus had no effect on anxiety in either wild-type or NMB-R-deficient mice. Furthermore, pain response of wild-type and NMB-R-deficient mice induced by electric foot shock was not affected under either stressed or non-stressed conditions. These results indicate that impaired memory performance in stressed NMB-R-deficient mice is not a consequence of changes in spontaneous activity, anxiety, or pain response, and suggest that the NMB/NMB-R pathway may play a role in regulating the stress response via the neural system that controls learning and memory.","['Animals', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Blood Glucose', 'Electroshock', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Maze Learning', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors', 'Mice', 'Motor Activity', 'Pain', 'Receptors, Bombesin', 'Restraint, Physical', 'Stress, Physiological']",12576129,"[['B01.050'], ['F02.463.425.097', 'F02.463.785.373.173'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['E05.723.402.403', 'F04.669.224'], ['G05.380'], ['F02.463.425.874.500'], ['C16.320.565', 'C18.452.648'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['F01.145.632', 'G11.427.410.698'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.070', 'D12.776.543.750.720.600.200', 'D12.776.543.750.750.555.200'], ['E02.085.700', 'E05.472.760'], ['G07.775']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7569,Irreversible inhibition of glutamate decarboxylase by alpha-(fluoromethyl)glutamic acid.,"alpha-(Fluoromethyl)glutamic acid (FMG) was synthesized and shown to be an active site directed irreversible inhibitor of glutamate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15) from Escherichia coli. The KI for the active enantiomer is 1.4 microM, and the kinh = 5.9 X 10(-3) s-1. Substrates for the enzyme, such as L-glutamate, and competitive inhibitors, such as citrate, decrease the rates of FMG-mediated inactivation of the enzyme. A profound change in the ultraviolet spectrum of the enzyme accompanies the inactivation process. When [3H]-FMG is used, it can be shown that the enzyme incorporates radioactivity at the same rate as that of inactivation. There is a 1:1 stoichiometry of [3H]FMG incorporated to pyridoxal phosphate binding subunits of the enzyme. From these and other studies it is concluded that FMG is a substrate for the enzyme and alkylates it as a consequence of this turnover.","['Binding, Competitive', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Carboxy-Lyases', 'Citrates', 'Escherichia coli', 'Glutamate Decarboxylase', 'Glutamates', 'Kinetics', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Tritium']",7011364,"[['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['D01.268.150.075.328', 'D01.496.123.328', 'D01.496.749.154'], ['D08.811.520.224.125'], ['D02.241.081.901.434'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D08.811.520.224.125.250'], ['D12.125.067.625', 'D12.125.119.409'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.196.712.726', 'E05.196.867.826'], ['D01.268.406.875', 'D01.362.340.875', 'D01.496.749.925']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9786,Detection of genetic diversity and selection at the coding region of the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) gene in Tibetan pigs and Landrace pigs.,"Domestication and subsequent selective pressures have produced a large variety of pig coat colors in different regions and breeds. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene plays a crucial role in determining coat color of mammals. Here, we investigated genetic diversity and selection at the coding region of the porcine melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) in Tibetan pigs and Landrace pigs. By contrast, genetic variability was much lower in Landrace pigs than in Tibetan pigs. Meanwhile, haplotype analysis showed that Tibetan pigs possessed shared haplotypes, suggesting a possibility of recent introgression event by way of crossbreeding with neighboring domestic pigs or shared ancestral polymorphism. Additionally, we detected positive selection at the MC1R in both Tibetan pigs and Landrace pigs through the dN/dS analysis. These findings suggested that novel phenotypic change (dark coat color) caused by novel mutations may help Tibetan pigs against intensive solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and camouflage in wild environment, whereas white coat color in Landrace were intentionally selected by human after domestication. Furthermore, both the phylogenetic analysis and the network analysis provided clues that MC1R in Asian and European wild boars may have initially experienced different selective pressures, and MC1R alleles diversified in modern domesticated pigs.","['Animals', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hair Color', 'Haplotypes', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phylogeography', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Swine', 'Tibet']",26431999,"[['B01.050'], ['Z01.252'], ['Z01.542'], ['G05.365'], ['G13.500', 'G16.690.490'], ['G05.380.360'], ['G05.360.335.760.640', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.650'], ['H01.158.273.343.335.500', 'H01.277.500.589'], ['G05.360.340.024.380.937'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.430.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.600.285.500.500', 'D12.776.543.750.750.555.285.500.500', 'D12.776.543.750.750.660.285.500.500'], ['G05.783'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['Z01.252.474.164.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

19825,Adsorptive removal of arsenic from water by an iron-zirconium binary oxide adsorbent.,"Arsenate and arsenite may exist simultaneously in groundwater and have led to a greater risk to human health. In this study, an iron-zirconium (Fe-Zr) binary oxide adsorbent for both arsenate and arsenite removal was prepared by a coprecipitation method. The adsorbent was amorphous with a specific surface area of 339 m(2)/g. It was effective for both As(V) and As(III) removal; the maximum adsorption capacities were 46.1 and 120.0 mg/g at pH 7.0, respectively, much higher than for many reported adsorbents. Both As(V) and As(III) adsorption occurred rapidly and achieved equilibrium within 25 h, which were well fitted by the pseudo-second-order equation. Competitive anions hindered the sorption according to the sequence PO(4)(3-)>SiO(3)(2-)>CO(3)(2-)>SO(4)(2-). The ionic strength effect experiment, measurement of zeta potential, and FTIR study indicate that As(V) forms inner-sphere surface complexes, while As(III) forms both inner- and outer-sphere surface complexes at the water/Fe-Zr binary oxide interface. The high uptake capability and good stability of the Fe-Zr binary oxide make it a potentially attractive adsorbent for the removal of both As(V) and As(III) from water.","['Adsorption', 'Arsenates', 'Arsenic', 'Arsenites', 'Ferric Compounds', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Water', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Water Purification', 'Zirconium']",21440898,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['D01.075.025', 'D01.248.497.158.050'], ['D01.268.513.249'], ['D01.075.050', 'D01.248.497.158.055'], ['D01.490.100'], ['G02.300'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['G02.640'], ['E05.196.712.726.676.700', 'E05.196.867.826.676.700'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.900.900', 'N06.850.860.510.900.900'], ['D01.268.556.950', 'D01.268.956.937', 'D01.552.544.950']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
14091,Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma in cyanotic congenital heart disease.,"CONTEXT: Aberrant cellular oxygen sensing is a leading theory for development of pheochromocytoma (PHEO) and paraganglioma (PGL).OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) increases the risk for PHEO-PGL.DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We investigated the association between CCHD and PHEO-PGL with two complementary studies: study 1) an international consortium was established to identify congenital heart disease (CHD) patients with a PHEO-PGL diagnosis confirmed by pathology or biochemistry and imaging; study 2) the 2000-2009 Nationwide Inpatient Survey, a nationally representative discharge database, was used to determine population-based cross-sectional PHEO-PGL frequency in hospitalized CCHD patients compared with noncyanotic CHD and those without CHD using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and genetic PHEO-PGL syndromes.RESULTS: In study 1, we identified 20 PHEO-PGL cases, of which 18 had CCHD. Most presented with cardiovascular or psychiatric symptoms. Median cyanosis duration for the CCHD PHEO-PGL cases was 20 years (range 1-57 y). Cases were young at diagnosis (median 31.5 y, range 15-57 y) and 7 of 18 had multiple tumors (two bilateral PHEO; six multifocal or recurrent PGL), whereas 11 had single tumors (seven PHEO; four PGL). PGLs were abdominal (13 of 17) or head/neck (4 of 17). Cases displayed a noradrenergic biochemical phenotype similar to reported hypoxia-related PHEO-PGL genetic syndromes but without clinical signs of such syndromes. In study 2, hospitalized CCHD patients had an increased likelihood of PHEO-PGL (adjusted odds ratio 6.0, 95% confidence interval 2.6-13.7, P < .0001) compared with those without CHD; patients with noncyanotic CHD had no increased risk (odds ratio 0.9, P = .48).CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong link between CCHD and PHEO-PGL. Whether these rare diseases coassociate due to hypoxic stress, common genetic or developmental factors, or some combination requires further investigation.","['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Gland Neoplasms', 'Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyanosis', 'Female', 'Heart Defects, Congenital', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraganglioma', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",25581599,"[['M01.060.057'], ['C04.588.322.078', 'C19.053.347', 'C19.344.078'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['C23.888.248'], ['C14.240.400', 'C14.280.400', 'C16.131.240.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.700', 'C04.557.580.625.650.700'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.700.725', 'C04.557.580.625.650.700.725'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
33676,High-frequency jet ventilation during oleic-acid induced pulmonary oedema.,"In oleic acid-induced pulmonary oedema (OAPO) sequential intrapulmonary fluid accumulation occurs leading to different expiratory flow pattern in dependent lung regions. The potential effects on efficacy of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV, f = 3 Hz, I: E = 0.43, FiO2 = 0.4) were studied and compared with continuous positive pressure ventilation (CPPV, f = 12-18/min, I:E = 0.5, TV = 12 ml/kg, PEEP = 0.5 kPa, FiO2 = 0.4) in a dog model of OAPO. In the control state (lung-healthy dogs), 15 min after oleic acid lung injury (interstitial oedema, period I) and 60 min after onset of OAPO (alveolar oedema, period II), gas exchange, lung volumes, compliance, resistance and haemodynamics were measured. The course of lung oedema was determined indirectly by means of washout curves of helium (foreign gas bolus-test, FGB) and nitrogen (single breath-test for oxygen, SBO2). During control, there were no significant differences between the HFJV-group (n = 7) and the CPPV-group (n = 6) by virtue of gas exchange, lung volumes and haemodynamics. During period I, PaO2 decreased significantly both with HFJV (p less than 0.01) and CPPV (p less than 0.05), being lower in the HFJV-group (p less than 0.05). PaCO2, pulmonary and haemodynamic parameters were unchanged. Onset of phase IV of the alveolar plateau (closing volume CV) occurred significantly earlier (p less than 0.05) in all animals. Impaired ventilation of dependent lung regions, increased maldistribution of intrapulmonary gas and VA/Q-mismatching may be the underlying mechanisms for lower efficacy of HFJV during interstitial lung oedema. In period II, pulmonary and cardiocirculatory parameters had changed significantly in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dogs', 'Hemodynamics', 'High-Frequency Jet Ventilation', 'Lung Compliance', 'Oleic Acids', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Pulmonary Gas Exchange']",2654240,"[['B01.050'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G09.330.380'], ['E02.041.625.508.510', 'E02.880.820.508.510'], ['E01.370.386.700.475', 'G09.772.540'], ['D10.251.355.325.600'], ['E02.041.625.790', 'E02.880.820.790'], ['C08.381.742'], ['E01.370.386.700.650', 'G03.143.775.602', 'G09.772.705.760.602']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15102,Representations of numerical and non-numerical magnitude both contribute to mathematical competence in children.,"A growing body of evidence suggests that non-symbolic representations of number, which humans share with nonhuman animals, are functionally related to uniquely human mathematical thought. Other research suggesting that numerical and non-numerical magnitudes not only share analog format but also form part of a general magnitude system raises questions about whether the non-symbolic basis of mathematical thinking is unique to numerical magnitude. Here we examined this issue in 5- and 6-year-old children using comparison tasks of non-symbolic number arrays and cumulative area as well as standardized tests of math competence. One set of findings revealed that scores on both magnitude comparison tasks were modulated by ratio, consistent with shared analog format. Moreover, scores on these tasks were moderately correlated, suggesting overlap in the precision of numerical and non-numerical magnitudes, as expected under a general magnitude system. Another set of findings revealed that the precision of both types of magnitude contributed shared and unique variance to the same math measures (e.g. calculation and geometry), after accounting for age and verbal competence. These findings argue against an exclusive role for non-symbolic number in supporting early mathematical understanding. Moreover, they suggest that mathematical understanding may be rooted in a general system of magnitude representation that is not specific to numerical magnitude but that also encompasses non-numerical magnitude.","['Child', 'Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comprehension', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Competency', 'Symbolism']",27146696,"[['M01.060.406'], ['F01.525.200', 'G07.345.374.750'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['F02.463.188.357'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H01.548'], ['F01.590', 'F02.410', 'I01.880.604.583.530', 'N03.706.535.625'], ['K01.400.899', 'K01.752.798']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
25395,The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. Management and vaccination strategies in The Netherlands.,"Prior to 2009, The Netherlands had prepared itself extensively for a potential pandemic. Multidisciplinary guidelines had been drafted to control transmission and limit adverse outcomes for both a phase of early incidental introduction and for a phase with widespread transmission. The Ministry of Health had ensured a supply and distribution schedule for antivirals and negotiated a contract for vaccine purchases. During the pandemic, existing surveillance was expanded, the established infectious disease response structure was activated, and the previously prepared protocols for communication, diagnostics, use of antivirals, and vaccination implementation were operationalized and implemented. When the pandemic turned out to be less severe than many had anticipated, risk communication and rapid modification of guidelines and communication became a major challenge. Antivirals and pandemic vaccines were reserved for those at high risk for severe outcomes only. Overall, the impact of the pandemic was comparable to the impact of an average seasonal influenza epidemic, but with a shift in (severe) outcomes from the very young and elderly toward young adults. Established prepared protocols enabled timely coordinated responses. In preparing for the worst, sufficient attention must be given to preparing for a mild scenario as well.","['Disease Notification', 'Health Communication', 'Health Planning', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza Vaccines', 'Influenza, Human', 'Mass Vaccination', 'Netherlands', 'Pandemics', 'Population Surveillance']",23275958,"[['E05.318.362', 'N06.850.520.373', 'N06.850.780.200.262'], ['L01.143.350', 'N02.208'], ['N03.349', 'N03.706.615.302'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B04.820.480.968.405.400.214'], ['D20.215.894.899.302'], ['C01.748.310', 'C01.925.782.620.365', 'C08.730.310'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.530.890.500', 'E05.478.550.600.890.500', 'N02.421.726.608.500', 'N02.421.726.758.310.890.500', 'N06.850.780.200.425.900.500', 'N06.850.780.680.310.890.500'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['N06.850.290.200.600'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1

36288,[Clinical and radiologic results of surgically-treated acetabular fractures].,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the functional and radiologic results of surgical treatment in patients with displaced acetabular fractures.METHODS: The study included 21 patients (13 males, 8 females; mean age 35 years; range 21 to 63 years). Before surgery, all the patients were evaluated with anteroposterior, iliac, and obturator oblique views and computed tomography scans. According to the Letournel-Judet classification, the fractures were simple in 10 patients and complex in 11 patients. Twelve patients had posterior wall and/or the posterior column fractures. Four patients underwent closed reduction under emergency settings for accompanying posterior dislocations. The mean time to surgery was 4.8 days (range 1 to 13 days). Surgery was performed by the Kocher-Langenbeck approach (n=12), a triradiate approach (n=5), and a modified extended iliofemoral approach (n=4). Functional results were assessed by the D'Aubigne-Postel's knee scoring system and radiologic results using anteroposterior, iliac, and obturator oblique views. The mean follow-up was 31 months (range 19 to 64 months).RESULTS: Functional results were excellent in eight patients (38.1%), good in seven (33.3%), satisfactory in four (19.1%), and poor in two patients (9.5%). Radiologic examination showed posttraumatic arthrosis in four patients (19.1%), heterotopic ossification in three patients (14.3%), and avascular necrosis in two patients (9.5%). Radiologic results were excellent and good in 16 patients (76.2%), satisfactory in three patients (14.3%), and poor in two patients (9.5%).CONCLUSION: Clinical and radiologic results showed concordance. The presence of dislocations and inadequate reduction were associated with poor functional results.","['Acetabulum', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Fracture Fixation', 'Fractures, Bone', 'Humans', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ossification, Heterotopic', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Range of Motion, Articular', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey']",12704246,"[['A02.835.232.043.825.108'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E04.555.300'], ['C26.404'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.875.500', 'E05.944.600', 'N04.452.859.564.800.500', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.800.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.751'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E01.370.600.700', 'G11.427.760'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['Z01.252.245.500.850']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
18907,Trends and characteristics of naloxone therapy reported to US poison centers.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In the United States, access to naloxone has been expanded as a measure to address growing opioid overdose mortality. The study aimed to describe the national trends in naloxone use as reported to the US poison centers (PCs).METHODS: The National Poison Data System (NPDS) was queried for cases reporting naloxone therapy from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2016. Demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed descriptively. Trends in naloxone reports were evaluated by using generalized linear mixed models that were adjusted for age, gender and random effects of the geographical census region. Cumulative incidence rates (CIR) of naloxone reports at the state- and national-level were calculated.RESULTS: There were 304 249 cases reporting naloxone therapy during the study period. The frequency of naloxone reports increased from 9498 in 2000 to 26 826 in 2016. The proportion of cases where naloxone was used prior to PC recommendation increased from 59.8% in 2000 to 81.5% in 2016. The mean number of NPDS naloxone reports per 100 000 human exposures increased from 9.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 6.4-14.2] to 31.7 (95% CI = 21.4-46.9, P < 0.001). Among the cases, 52.4% were female and the most frequent age group was 20-39 years (39.1%). The principal reason for a toxic exposure resulting in a naloxone report was suspected suicide (55.0%). Life-threatening symptoms were seen in one-fifth of the cases, with 53.9% cases being admitted to critical care units.

28606,What motivates women to breastfeed in Lebanon: An exploratory qualitative analysis.,"This exploratory qualitative study examined the influence of injunctive and descriptive norms on breastfeeding, a health-improving behaviour related to a highly committed personal decision. The research explores the different mechanisms through which social norms impact breastfeeding behaviour pre or post-adoption of breastfeeding practice. A qualitative approach was used by performing in-depth analysis of cross-sectional accounts of women in Lebanon contemplating adoption of breastfeeding practice and women who already breastfed. Interviews were also conducted with medical professionals, lactation specialists, and breastfeeding activists. On one hand, the attitude of the medical professionals and the government efforts are two mechanisms that stimulate the injunctive norms. On the other hand, the descriptive norms are defined by community attitude aggregated with societal beliefs and expectations on women's image and role in society. Both types of social norms are in constant interplay with personal norms and each type becomes more salient at different periods over time. The findings suggest that social norms are major determinants of breastfeeding behaviour. The influence of the type of social norm-descriptive or injunctive-on the decision to breastfeed varies according to the moment of life the mother is living. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Lebanon', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Social Norms']",29208482,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['F01.145.407.199', 'G07.203.650.195', 'G07.203.650.220.500.500', 'G07.203.650.353.199'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['F02.463.785.373'], ['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['F01.145.488'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.500.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.829.263.500.320.200', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340.270', 'M01.620.630'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['F01.829.750', 'I01.880.853.903']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
1720,Relationship between lung injury and lung lipid peroxidation caused by recurrent endotoxemia.,"We compared the relationship between lung lipid peroxidation and the histologic and physiologic changes seen after repeated doses of low dose endotoxin in unanesthetized sheep. Thirty-two sheep with lung lymph fistula were given from 1 to 10 doses of 1 micrograms/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin, 12 h apart. Animals were killed 5 h after 1, 3, 5, or 9 doses of endotoxin or 3 to 5 days after the tenth dose of endotoxin. The lipid peroxidation process was monitored by circulating conjugated dienes and lung tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) content. We found that conjugated dienes and MDA were increased after one dose of endotoxin corresponding in time with the increased prostanoid production and increased permeability. Acute lung inflammation was also evident histologically. Lipid peroxidation was not increased, however, when 3 to 7 doses were given. The permeability change was also markedly attenuated whereas severe lung inflammation was still present on histologic examination. After 9 doses, we noted a fourfold increase in lung tissue MDA that corresponded histologically with a marked mononuclear cell infiltration. Physiologic changes included a sustained 50% increase in oxygen consumption. However, lung lymph flow was not increased, again, reflecting lung inflammation with no change in lung vascular permeability. The MDA remained increased 5 days after the last dose of endotoxin along with a marked lung mononuclear cell infiltration. The lung MDA content corresponded with the level of increase in VO2, but not with changes in pulmonary vascular permeability. Conjugated dienes were increased only after the first injection of endotoxin. The lung lipid peroxidation process does not appear to correspond to physiologic or histologic lung changes after recurrent exposures to endotoxin.","['Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endotoxins', 'Escherichia coli', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lipid Peroxides', 'Lung', 'Malondialdehyde', 'Pneumonia', 'Recurrence', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases', 'Time Factors']",2653147,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D23.946.123.329'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G02.111.515', 'G03.295.531.587'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.637', 'D01.339.431.374.637', 'D01.650.550.750.600', 'D02.389.338.450', 'D10.440'], ['A04.411'], ['D02.047.700'], ['C01.748.610', 'C08.381.677', 'C08.730.610'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['C22.836'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
22154,Use of vascular sealing devices (VasoSeal and Perclose) versus assisted manual compression (Femostop) in transcatheter coronary interventions requiring abciximab (ReoPro).,"UNLABELLED: Transcatheter coronary interventions requiring abciximab (ReoPro) are associated with vascular access site complications. Several devices have been developed to aid in the closure of the femoral arteriotomy, including collagen plug devices (VasoSeal, AngioSeal), percutaneous suture closure (Perclose), and aids to manual compression (Femostop). In 185 patients who received abciximab plus aspirin and heparin for transcatheter coronary interventions, we compared femoral arteriotomy closure by three different methods: VasoSeal, Perclose, and Femostop. A composite endpoint of late complications defined as an access site-related bleed or hematoma that required blood transfusion or an extended hospital stay, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, arterial or venous thrombosis was compared. VasoSeal was initially successful in 41/52 patients (78.8%). The 11 patients who failed to have adequate hemostasis with VasoSeal required manual compression aided by Femostop, but had no late complications. There was one access site infection and one fatal retroperitoneal hematoma unrelated to the vascular access site (surgically explored). There were no late complications. Perclose was successful in 48/56 patients (85.7%). One Perclose failure required surgical repair for an extensive arteriotomy. The other Perclose failure required manual compression aided by Femostop, but had no late complications. There were no access site infections requiring intravenous antibiotics. There was one retroperitoneal bleed that extended the patient's hospital stay and for which a blood transfusion was required. Femostop was successful in 77/77 patients (100%). There were no infections. Late complications occurred in four patients. These included three episodes of bleeding or hematomas requiring blood transfusion, and one pseudoaneurysm.CONCLUSION: In patients receiving abciximab in addition to aspirin and heparin, VasoSeal and Perclose are at least as safe as Femostop when used to achieve homeostasis after sheath removal. VasoSeal and Perclose have a significantly lower initial rate of successful hemostasis than Femostop. The numbers of late complications between the VasoSeal, Perclose, and Femostop groups were not significantly different. In those patients in whom VasoSeal or Perclose failed, no late complications occurred. Access site infections were no different between VasoSeal, Perclose, and Femostop.","['Abciximab', 'Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Anticoagulants', 'Collagen', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Female', 'Hemostasis, Surgical', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Hemorrhage', 'Treatment Outcome']",10376492,"[['D12.644.541.500.650.125', 'D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.060.125', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650.125', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.060.125', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650.125', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.200.125', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650.125'], ['E02.148.050.060.100', 'E04.100.376.719.100', 'E04.100.814.529.124.060.100', 'E04.100.814.529.968.050', 'E04.502.382.124.060.100', 'E04.502.382.968.050', 'E04.928.220.520.100', 'E05.157.016.060.100'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['D27.505.954.502.119'], ['D05.750.078.280', 'D12.776.860.300.250'], ['E01.370.350.130.625', 'E01.370.350.700.060.200', 'E01.370.370.050.200', 'E01.370.370.380.200'], ['E02.520.490', 'E04.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.541.500.650', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.414.941', 'C23.550.767.850'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
22996,[The indices of EEG spatial synchronization in normal 10- to 12-year-old schoolchildren and in learning difficulties].,"10-12-year-old schoolchildren were divided into three groups: a normal one, a group with psychological problems, and a third one with medical problems. The EEG was recorded at resting and while reading a text. An obviously higher global spatial synchronisation was found in the normal group as compared with the ""medical"" one. In the ""psychological"" group, a diffuse hyperresponsiveness was found in the transition state from resting to activity. The above differences seem to be due to a morpho-functional immaturity and a functional insufficiency of two different portions of the brain ascending activating system. Evidently the ""medical"" group children have an immaturity of the bulbar and midbrain reticular formation, whereas the ""psychological"" group children have, probably, an immature diencephalic activating system (the thalamus).","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Child', 'Cortical Synchronization', 'Humans', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reading', 'Wakefulness']",10494586,"[['F01.058'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E01.370.376.300.437.500', 'E01.370.405.245.575.500', 'G07.265.256.249'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.597.606.150.550', 'C23.888.592.604.150.550', 'F03.625.562'], ['E02.190.525.812', 'F02.830', 'F04.096.795', 'H01.158.782.795'], ['L01.559.423.557'], ['F02.830.104.821', 'G11.561.035.738']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
5380,Modified fluid wax impression for a severely resorbed edentulous mandibular ridge.,"This article describes a technique for making a definitive impression for highly displaceable residual ridges. The technique is especially applicable for mandibular edentulous ridges. The choice of the impression materials, as well as the design of the impression tray, focuses on preventing distortion of the displaceable residual ridges during impression making. Using an impression tray with an opening, modeling plastic impression compound and impression wax are used to accurately capture the shape of the residual ridge and place pressure onto denture load-bearing areas. Low-viscosity vinyl polysiloxane impression material is then used over the window opening to capture the surface details of the residual ridge without distorting the displaceable tissues. The use of this technique helps in maintaining the contour and capturing the detail of the tissues, as well as in accurately determining the extent of the muccobuccal denture extensions.","['Alveolar Bone Loss', 'Dental Impression Materials', 'Dental Impression Technique', 'Dental Models', 'Denture Design', 'Humans', 'Jaw, Edentulous', 'Mandible', 'Polyvinyls', 'Siloxanes', 'Waxes']",19328281,"[['C05.116.264.150', 'C07.465.714.354.500'], ['D25.339.334', 'J01.637.051.339.334'], ['E06.912.130'], ['E06.261', 'J01.897.280.500.545.129.200', 'L01.178.820.090.545.129.200'], ['E06.780.346.760.300', 'E06.912.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C05.500.480', 'C07.320.550', 'C07.465.550.425', 'C07.793.597.425'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.502.632', 'A14.521.632'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.616', 'D02.455.326.271.884.533', 'D05.750.716.721', 'D25.720.716.721', 'J01.637.051.720.716.721'], ['D01.837.800', 'D02.756.650', 'D05.750.900', 'D25.720.900', 'J01.637.051.720.900'], ['D10.945']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
11552,Post waxing folliculitis: a clinicopathological evaluation.,"BACKGROUND: Epilation by waxing is one of the common methods of removing unwanted body hair, and follicular papules following this cosmetic procedure are not uncommon. However, this not so uncommon problem has not been clinically and histopathologically evaluated.OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathological profile of folliculitis temporally developing after epilation by waxing.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Clinical and histopathological evaluation was done in 28 patients who developed follicular papules within a period of eight weeks following a history of epilation by waxing over the same area. The demographic profile and the method and frequency of waxing were noted. The symptoms associated with and the morphology and distribution of the follicular lesions were recorded. A punch biopsy was done from a representative follicular lesion to evaluate the pathological changes.RESULTS: All the patients recruited were females (100%) with a mean age of 24.33 + 2.43 years. While all 28 patients had waxed their forearms, 25 had waxed their arms, 18 their legs, and 10 their thighs. The most common sites affected by folliculitis were arms (25; 100%) and forearms (15/28; 53.6%). Thighs, though least frequently waxed, were involved in seven (70%) subjects. Of these, seven (25%) women complained of itching. The lesions in all patients were erythematous to skin colored follicular papules, though two (7.1%) patients also had nodular lesions. A punch biopsy done showed features suggestive of pseudofolliculitis. A granulomatous reaction was seen in nine (32.1%) biopsies. A foreign body identified as a hair shaft was seen in seven (25%) biopsies and keratin in one biopsy.CONCLUSIONS: Folliculitis following epilation by waxing is more frequent in proximal parts of the extremities than in distal parts, even though distal parts are more frequently waxed. In one-third of the cases, post-waxing folliculitis is due to foreign body reaction to hair shaft or keratin and resembles pseudofolliculitis. To know exact pathogenesis, additional biopsies with multiple step sections need to be taken to look for retained fragments of hair shaft and /or foreign body reaction.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arm', 'Female', 'Folliculitis', 'Foreign-Body Reaction', 'Hair Removal', 'Humans', 'Leg', 'Pruritus', 'Thigh', 'Young Adult']",24134338,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['A01.378.800.075'], ['C17.800.329.500'], ['C23.550.470.251', 'C26.392.560'], ['E02.218.372'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A01.378.610.500'], ['C17.800.685', 'C23.888.885.625'], ['A01.378.610.750'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
29462,Inhibition of HIV-1 proteinase by non-peptide carboxylates.,"Some simple dicarboxylates are among the first reported non-peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 proteinase. Only weak inhibition (IC50 greater than or equal to 10 microM) was observed but this may be significant since only two potential enzyme-binding groups are present. Dixon plots and preliminary kinetic data are reported and a possible mechanism for the inhibition is discussed. The dicarboxylates are long enough to engage the carboxylate side chains of Arg 8 and Arg 108 at either end of the 24A long substrate-binding groove. This mode of binding has not been proven but other molecules with similarly separated charged ends are equally effective inhibitors, perhaps indicating a common mechanism of inhibition. There is evidence that placing other functional groups on the inhibitor enables alternative interactions with the enzyme which can reduce inhibitor potency. We propose that incorporation of ionic binding groups in more elaborate and selective non-peptides may potentiate inhibition of HIV-1 proteinase.","['Arginine', 'Binding Sites', 'Dicarboxylic Acids', 'HIV Protease', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2018518,"[['D12.125.068.050', 'D12.125.095.104', 'D12.125.142.087'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['D02.241.081.337'], ['D08.811.277.656.074.500.340', 'D08.811.277.656.300.048.340', 'D08.811.277.656.979.500', 'D12.776.964.775.375.545.750', 'D12.776.964.900.500.625'], ['D27.505.519.389.745.900.500', 'D27.505.954.122.388.077.088.420'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['G02.111.570', 'G02.466'], ['E05.196.712.516.600.676', 'E05.196.867.726'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18280,Combinatorial interaction of two adjacent cis-active promoter regions mediates the synergistic induction of Bt2 gene by sucrose and ABA in maize endosperm.,"The accumulation of starch in cereal endosperm is a key process that determines crop yield and quality. Research has reported that sucrose and abscisic acid (ABA) synergistically regulate the synthesis of crop starch. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind this synergistic effect. In this study, the effect of sucrose and ABA on starch synthesis in maize endosperm was investigated. The starch content, the ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) concentration, and the expression of AGPase-encoding genes were found to be enhanced slightly by sucrose or ABA alone, but were elevated significantly by the co-treatment of sucrose and ABA. Truncation analysis of the Bt2 promoter via transient expression in maize endosperm showed that the promoter region (-370/-186) is involved in sucrose response, and that an adjacent region (-186/-43) responds to ABA. The synergistic induction of sucrose and ABA on Bt2 promoter activity requires interaction with both of these regions. Interestingly, removal of the sucrose-responsive region (-370 to -186) abolishes ABA responsiveness in the Bt2 promoter, even in the presence of ABA-responsive region (-186 to -43). This study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie the synergistic regulation of starch synthesis and grain filling from sucrose and ABA in cereal endosperm.","['Abscisic Acid', 'Drug Synergism', 'Edible Grain', 'Endosperm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Plant Growth Regulators', 'Plant Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Starch', 'Sucrose', 'Zea mays']",30080620,"[['D02.241.223.268.034', 'D02.455.326.271.665.202.061', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249.024', 'D02.455.849.131.061', 'D02.455.849.765.521.500'], ['G07.690.773.968.477'], ['A18.024.500.750.500', 'B01.650.160.250', 'B01.650.510.250', 'G07.203.300.300.550', 'G07.203.300.775.500', 'J02.500.300.550', 'J02.500.775.500'], ['A18.024.500.750.666'], ['G05.308.375'], ['D27.505.696.377.760'], ['D12.776.765'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D05.750.078.562.855', 'D09.301.915', 'D09.698.365.855'], ['D09.698.629.305.770', 'D09.947.750.770'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.966']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

13538,Synergistic deep removal of As(III) and Cd(II) by a calcined multifunctional MgZnFe-CO3,"A high removal rate (>99.7%) of combined arsenite (As(III)) and Cd (Cd(II)) in low concentration (1000 ìg/L) from contaminated water was achieved by a calcined MgZnFe-CO3 layered double hydroxide (CMZF) adsorbent. Batch control studies and a series of spectroscopy detection technologies were employed to investigate the removal mechanism and interactions between As(III) and Cd(II) on the interface of water/CMZF. Synergistic adsorption and photooxidation occurred based on the systematical kinetic and isotherm studies. The enhanced removal of As(III) was achieved by the photooxidation, formation of ternary As(III)Cd(II) surface complexes and enhanced hydrogen bond. Meanwhile, oxidative formed negative charged As(V) could reduce the electrostatic repulsion force between Cd(II) cations and play a role as anion bridging, consequently resulted in a stronger attraction between CMZF and Cd(II). Combined with the verdicts of relevant characterizations such as XRD, XPS and EPR, it was assumed that the deep co-removal mechanism could be attributed to the coupling of various processes including intercalation, complexation, photooxidation of As(III) and precipitation of CdCO3. Moreover, the successful removal of As(III) and Cd(II) from real water matrix qualified the CMZF a potentially attractive adsorbent for both As(III) and Cd(II) deep treatment in practical engineering.","['Adsorption', 'Arsenic', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydroxides', 'Iron', 'Kinetics', 'Magnesium', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Photochemical Processes', 'Temperature', 'Zinc']",30870628,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['D01.268.513.249'], ['D01.268.556.137', 'D01.268.956.061', 'D01.552.544.137'], ['E05.196.150', 'G02.159'], ['G02.300'], ['D01.045.250', 'D01.248.497.158.459'], ['D01.268.556.412', 'D01.268.956.287', 'D01.552.544.412'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G02.111.570.820'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['G02.740'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['D01.268.556.940', 'D01.268.956.906', 'D01.552.544.940']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
41713,Direct postoperative and follow-up results of transsphenoidal surgery in 19 acromegalic patients pretreated with octreotide compared to those in untreated matched controls.,"In this study 19 patients were preoperatively treated with octreotide for 1-17 months (mean, 5 months), with doses from 150-1500 microg daily, and those patients were matched to 19 untreated patients with comparable tumor classification and preoperative serum GH concentrations. Octreotide was started at 300 microg daily by s.c. injections or continuous sc infusion using a pump in increasing doses, depending on the responses of the serum GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations. During pretreatment, seven patients achieved a serum GH concentration below 5 mU/L, whereas six patients normalized their serum IGF-I. Postoperatively, a serum GH concentration below 5 mU/L was achieved in 15 pretreated and 14 untreated patients, a normal serum IGF-I level (<2 SD) was achieved in 10 pretreated and 15 untreated patients, and normal serum GH suppression during GTT was reached in 12 treated and 14 control patients. No differences were found in complication rate or incidence of hypopituitarism caused by surgery. Adjuvant therapy was required in 7 treated and 5 untreated patients. At follow-up examination, 5.7 and 4 yr postoperatively, 10 pretreated and 12 control patients could be considered cured by surgery only, according to our criteria for remission (serum GH, <5 mU/L; normal GH suppression and normal serum IGF-I). In summary, we found no difference in direct postoperative and follow-up results of transsphenoidal surgery between pretreated patients and untreated patients.

25308,Is cold paresis related to axonal depolarization?,"Cold paresis may occur in multifocal motor neuropathy and lower motor neuron disease. It was proposed to reflect nerve lesions where axons are depolarized due to loss of Na/K-pump activity. In those circumstances, a further decrease in pump activity by cooling may induce extra depolarization, conduction block, and weakness. Evidence for this hypothesis is incomplete because it is unknown if cold induces depolarization in human motor axons and other factors may contribute to the symptoms. To solve these questions, we examined 10 normal subjects. At 37, 25, 20, and 15°C we assessed: excitability in the median nerve, decrement on 3-Hz stimulation, pulsed Doppler of a wrist artery, and thenar muscle strength. Cooling induced: (1) findings compatible with axonal depolarization on excitability testing (fanning-in of threshold electrotonus, steepened current threshold relation, increased refractory period, decreased super- and subexcitability), (2) decreased Doppler peak systolic velocity without causing ischemia, (3) decreased muscle strength and impaired muscle relaxation. Decrement tests and compound muscle action potential amplitude remained normal. The excitability findings induced by cooling were best explained by axonal depolarization due to the effect of temperature on Na/K-pump activity. The induced weakness may be explained not only by this mechanism but also by impaired muscle contraction.","['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Axons', 'Cold Temperature', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electromyography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Median Nerve', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Neural Conduction', 'Paresis', 'Temperature', 'Young Adult']",21040145,"[['G04.580.100', 'G07.265.675.100', 'G11.561.570.100'], ['M01.060.116'], ['A08.675.542.145', 'A11.284.180.075', 'A11.671.137', 'A11.671.501.145'], ['G01.906.595.272', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.300', 'G16.500.750.775.710.300', 'N06.230.300.100.725.154', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.300'], ['E05.723.402'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A08.800.800.720.050.500'], ['G11.427.494'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['G07.265.753', 'G11.561.601'], ['C10.597.636', 'C23.888.592.643'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
46578,Design of antibiotic containing hydrogel wound dressings: biomedical properties and histological study of wound healing.,"Keeping in view the antioxidant nature of the acacia gum and mucoadhesive nature of carbopol hydrogels, in the present studies, an attempt has been made to explore the potential of these materials in designing new hydrogel wound dressings meant for slow release of gentamicin, an antibiotic drug, and to enhance the wound healing potential. The hydrogel films were characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD and swelling studies. Biomedical properties of hydrogel films like blood compatibility, antioxidant activity, mucoadhesion, antimicrobial activity, oxygen/water vapour permeability, microbial penetration and mechanical properties (tensile strength, burst strength, resilience, relaxation, and folding endurance) have been evaluated. The histological studies of wound healing were also carried out on swiss albino mice of strain Balb C and it has been observed that in case of wounds covered with hydrogel dressings shown faster wound healing, formation of well developed fibroblasts and blood capillaries as compared to open wounds. The results of biomedical properties indicated that hydrogel films are non-thrombogenic, non-haemolytic, antioxidant and mucoadhesive in nature, and are permeable to oxygen and moisture while impermeable to micro-organisms. The hydrogel wound dressings have absorbed (8.772 ± 0.184 g/g film) simulated wound fluid.

47379,Capacitative Ca2+ entry contributes to the Ca2+ influx induced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in GH3 pituitary cells.,"Treatment of GH3 cells with either hypothalamic peptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), the endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin or the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin mobilized, with different kinetics, essentially all of the Ca2+ pool from the intracellular Ca2+ stores. Any of the above- described treatments induced a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and was prevented by Ni2+ but not by dihydropyridines (DHPs), suggesting that it was due to capacitative Ca2+ entry via activation of a plasma membrane pathway which opened upon the emptying of the intracellular Ca2+ stores. The increase of the plasma membrane permeability to Ca2+ correlated negatively with the filling degree of the intracellular Ca2+ stores and was reversed by refilling of the stores. The mechanism of capacitative Ca2+ entry into GH3 cells differed from similar mechanisms described in several types of blood cells in that the pathway was poorly permeable to Mn2+ and not sensitive to cytochrome P450 inhibitors. In GH3 cells, TRH induced a transient [Ca2+]i increase due to Ca2+ release from the stores (phase 1) followed by a sustained [Ca2+]i increase due to Ca2+ entry (phase 2). At the single-cell level, phase 2 was composed of a DHP-insensitive sustained [Ca2+]i increase, due to activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry, superimposed upon which DHP- sensitive [Ca2+]i oscillations took place. The two components of the TRH-induced Ca2+ entry differed also in that [Ca2+]i oscillations remained for several minutes after TRH removal, whereas the sustained [Ca2+]i increase dropped quickly to prestimulatory levels, following the same time course as the refilling of the stores. The drop was prevented when the refilling was inhibited by thapsigargin. It is concluded that, even though the mechanisms of capacitative Ca2+ entry may show differences from cell to cell, it is also present and may contribute to the regulation of physiological functions in excitable cells such as GH3. There, capacitative Ca2+ entry cooperates with voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to generate the [Ca2+]i increase seen during phase 2 of TRH action. This contribution of capacitative Ca2+ entry may be relevant to the enhancement of prolactin secretion induced by TRH.","['Calcium', 'Calcium Channels', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Dihydropyridines', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Ionomycin', 'Manganese', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior', 'Signal Transduction', 'Terpenes', 'Thapsigargin', 'Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone']",8594545,"[['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.250', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.500', 'D12.776.157.530.813.250', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.500', 'D12.776.543.585.813.250'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G03.143.335', 'G04.175'], ['D27.505.389.500', 'D27.505.519.389.335'], ['D03.383.725.203'], ['A11.284.149.450', 'A11.284.835.514'], ['D10.251.355.391'], ['D01.268.556.484', 'D01.268.956.374', 'D01.552.544.484'], ['A06.300.747.500', 'A06.688.357.750.500', 'A08.186.211.180.497.352.435.500.500', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.352.435.500.500', 'A08.713.357.750.500'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D02.455.849'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.284.500.888', 'D02.455.849.765.674.500.750.888', 'D04.663.500.750.888'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.880', 'D12.644.400.400.740.880', 'D12.644.456.837', 'D12.644.548.365.740.880', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.880', 'D12.776.631.650.810']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23090,Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Signaling Pathway Changes with Intestinal Epithelial Cells Renewal Along Crypt-Villus Axis.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Understanding the mechanism that involves in regulating epithelial cells renewal is the fundamental of regulating intestinal mucosa development and functions and related diseases. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway involves in controlling various major processes by integrating intracellular and extracellular cues. The present experiment was conducted to test the correlation between the mTOR signaling pathway and intestinal epithelial cells renewal along crypt-villus axis (CVA).METHODS: Intestinal epithelial cells were sequentially isolated from the jejunum of piglets along CVA, and the amount or phosphorylation level of proteins involved in cell cycle, mTOR signaling pathway, gene expression, and the antioxidant capacity in the isolated cells were measured.RESULTS: The results showed that the amount of proteins involved in cell cycle decreased from crypt to villus tip. The amount or phosphorylation level of proteins related to mTOR signaling pathway in intestinal epithelial cells mainly decreased during maturation along CVA. The amount of proteins involved in gene expression and the antioxidant capacity also decreased from crypt to the top of villi.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the mTOR signaling pathway may be involved in regulating the intestinal epithelial cells renewal along CVA and it may partly through affecting the antioxidant capacity and gene expression of intestinal epithelial cells. Further histological verification is needed to confirm the results of the present experiments.","['Animals', 'Animals, Suckling', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Jejunum', 'Microvilli', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Swine', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",27459644,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.293'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['D12.776.167'], ['G04.152'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['A11.251'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['A11.436'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['A03.556.124.684.500', 'A03.556.249.750'], ['A11.284.180.565'], ['D12.776.817'], ['H01.158.201.843', 'H01.158.273.180.350.700', 'H01.158.273.343.350.700', 'H01.181.122.738'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.931', 'D12.776.476.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
26499,Isolation and characterization of Borrelia hermsii associated with two foci of tick-borne relapsing fever in California.,"Relapsing fever, caused by the spirochete Borrelia hermsii and transmitted by the soft tick Ornithodoros hermsi, is endemic in many rural mountainous areas of California. Between 1996 and 1998, 12 cases of relapsing fever associated with two exposure sites in northern California were investigated. Follow-up at exposure sites included collection of soft ticks and serum specimens from sylvatic rodents. Attempts to cultivate spirochetes were made through inoculation of patient blood into mice and by feeding Ornithodoros ticks on mice. Three isolates of B. hermsii were recovered from two blood specimens and one pool of ticks. The protein and plasmid profiles of the three isolates were comparable to those of previous B. hermsii isolates from the western United States. Western immunoblotting of patient sera demonstrated an expanding immunologic response to antigens within four distinct molecular weight regions by 3 to 4 weeks postonset. Antibody to B. hermsii was detected in sera from 4 of 11 yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus); no other rodent species collected were seropositive.","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Borrelia', 'California', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ornithodoros', 'Relapsing Fever', 'Rural Population']",15004063,"[['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050'], ['B03.440.425.410.711.193', 'B03.851.595.193'], ['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['H01.277.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['B01.050.500.131.166.132.832.100.700'], ['C01.150.252.400.794.352.500', 'C01.920.930.775'], ['N01.600.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
44185,Molecular mechanisms governing tumor-necrosis-factor-mediated regulation of plasminogen-activator inhibitor type-2 gene expression.,"Plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2), a serine protease inhibitor involved in the regulation of urokinase-dependent proteolysis, is also implicated in the inhibition of tumor-necrosis-factor-(TNF)-mediated apoptosis. The PAI-2 gene is one of the most TNF-responsive genes known and is also highly induced by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, in both HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and U-937 histiocytic cells. We sought to identify and characterize regulatory cis-acting DNA elements and trans-acting factors which mediate basal and inducible PAI-2 gene transcription. A series of promoter deletion mutants (nucleotides -1859 to -91) fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene were transfected into HT-1080 cells. Two repressor regions were identified; one distally between positions -1859 and -1100, and one proximally between positions -259 and -219. Cells transfected with constructs harboring more than 259 bp promoter sequence produced a 10-15-fold increase in CAT activity when treated with PMA or okadaic acid, but produced only a minimal (2.5-fold) increase in response to TNF. Removal of the proximal repressor by deletion to position -219, or by internal deletion from the -1100 PAI-2 CAT construct, resulted in a selective increase in TNF responsiveness, suggesting that induction of PAI-2 gene transcription by TNF is associated with derepression. Detailed analysis of the proximal repressor utilizing the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), identified two novel and distinct protein-binding sites (A and B). Site A is located within the 40-bp proximal repressor while site B is situated immediately adjacent to the 3' boundary. Treatment of cells with PMA or okadaic acid produced no change in the binding activity of proteins recognising sites A or B. However, treatment of cells with TNF results in a profound selective reduction in site-B-binding activity, suggesting that this site plays a significant role in TNF-mediated regulation of PAI-2 gene expression. Our findings suggest that TNF-mediated induction of PAI-2 gene expression involves derepression and is associated with cis-acting and trans-acting factors located within and adjacent to the proximal repressor region.","['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",8898893,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['D13.444.600.223', 'D27.505.259.750.600.223', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['D12.776.660'], ['D12.644.861.695.520', 'D12.776.124.125.645', 'D12.776.872.695.520', 'D23.119.832.750'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D12.776.260.703', 'D12.776.930.780'], ['E05.393.760'], ['G05.365.590.762', 'G05.558.800'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['A11.251.860'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Synthesis and action on guinea pig ileum.,"3,6-Dipropanoylmorphine (DPM), 3,6-dibutanoylmorphine (DBM), and 3,6-dihexanoylmorphine (DHM) were prepared as prospective long-acting narcotic analgesics. The purity and structure of these compounds were authenticated by high pressure liquid chromatography and direct probe mass spectrometry. In aqueous solution the stability of the HCI salts of these compounds decreased with increasing alkyl chain length such that DHM underwent rapid hydrolysis to 6-monohexanoylmorphine (MHM). A comparison of DPM, DBM, and MHM with morphine (MO) and 3,6-diacetylmorphine (DAM, heroin) in the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum myenteric plexus longitudinal muscle strip preparation (GUPIL) revealed similar potencies and efficacies for all compounds, but marked differences in the onset of drug action (MO greater than DAM greater than MHM greater than DPM greater than DBM, faster to slower). In a periodically washed GUPIL preparation DBM and MHM were five times longer acting than MO, DAM or DPM.","['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Heroin', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Morphine Derivatives', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Smooth']",6733591,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['D03.132.577.249.562.445', 'D03.605.497.607.490', 'D03.633.400.686.607.490', 'D04.615.723.795.576.445'], ['E05.481'], ['E05.196.566'], ['D03.132.577.249.562', 'D03.605.497.607', 'D03.633.400.686.607', 'D04.615.723.795.576'], ['G11.427.494'], ['A02.633.570', 'A10.690.467']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
11038,Methylation-sensitive protein-DNA interaction at the cell cycle regulatory domain of human thymidine kinase promoter.,"We have investigated the DNA-protein complex formation in nuclear extracts of human cells using the sequence of cell-cycle regulatory unit (CCRU) of human thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. It appeared that a distinct DNA-protein complex was present in three human tumor cell lines and that the CCAAT box within the sequence of CCRU was a necessary element for complex formation. Upon 4 days of serum deprivation, this DNA-protein complex remained unchanged in HeLa cells, but the expression of TK mRNA was decreased. Furthermore, DNA methylation of the Hhal site of the CCRU sequence of the TK promoter greatly reduced the binding activity of nuclear proteins from different human tumor cell lines. On the basis of these data, we proposed a possible role for DNA methylation in the regulation of TK transcription during late G1/S phase progression of the cell cycle.","['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Poly A', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Thymidine Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1280426,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['E05.196.401.095', 'E05.301.300.074', 'E05.601.100'], ['G04.144'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A11.284.430.106', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.117'], ['D13.444.308.425'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.337.539.275.700'], ['G02.111.035.538', 'G02.607.094.538', 'G03.059.538'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.776.660'], ['D13.695.578.550.500'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D13.444.735'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['G02.111.570.080.689', 'G05.360.080.689'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.750'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The oil yield depended on the seed comminution, the extraction temperature, the seeds-to-solvent ratio and the type of solvent. The oil yield was much higher if the seeds were ground before extraction. The oil yield increased with increasing the extraction temperature and with decreasing the seeds-to-solvent ratio. n-Hexane was somewhat more efficient in the oil extraction than petroleum ether. In recovering the tobacco seed oil (TSO), the UE was less efficient than the Soxhlet extraction. The advantage of the UE was a relatively high oil yield at 25 degrees C in a shorter time.

China) for a mean period of 16.1 years. The mean air Mn level in the workshop was 138.4 microg/m3. Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery (NCTB), including the Profile fo Mood States, (POMS), was performed. Blood pressure (BP) increase following immediate stand-up (BP-IS), serum prolactin (PRL) and plasma renin activity (PRA) in supine position were also determine. Most of the NCTB scores of the Mn-exposed workers were lower than those of controls, while the POMS scores were higher, indicating a Mn-induced impairment of neurophysiological functions and a deflection of mood towards negative emotion states. PRL values of the Mn-exposed workers were higher than those of the controls. BP-IS of Mn-exposed workers was significantly lower than that of the controls. PRA of the same workers was augmented more that 200%. In the Mn-exposed workers, the higher PRL values are possibly due to a reduced inhibitory effect on pituitary lactotrope cells by the tubero-infundibular dopamine system; the decreased BP-IS was referred to imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, whereas the higher basal PRA was thought to depend on neuroendocrine changes (including increased central sympathetic tone) and/or on a direct effect of Mn on renal juxta-glomerular cells. On the whole, this study demonstrates that occupational Mn exposure is responsible for neurobehavioral changes coexisting with alterations of neuroendocrine and humoral systems.","['Adult', 'Behavior', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Manganese', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Occupational Diseases', 'Prolactin', 'Renin', 'Trace Elements']",15345187,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.145'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.268.556.484', 'D01.268.956.374', 'D01.552.544.484'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.711.513'], ['A06.688', 'A08.713'], ['C24'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.773', 'D06.472.699.631.525.525', 'D12.644.548.691.525.525'], ['D08.811.277.656.074.500.780', 'D08.811.277.656.300.048.780', 'D08.811.277.656.837.750'], ['D01.268.811', 'D27.505.696.494.555', 'G07.203.300.681.500.555', 'J02.500.681.500.555']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

These data suggest that in vitro BM 06.022 achieved, compared with alteplase, the same maximal efficacy in fresh PPP-clot lysis despite a lower potency, but was less effective in lysing aged and fresh PRP and whole blood clots.","['Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Plasma', 'Plasminogen Activators', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator']",8388740,"[['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['G09.188.390.150.390'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['D12.644.541'], ['A12.207.152.693', 'A12.207.270.695', 'A15.145.693'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.635', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.635', 'D12.776.124.125.662'], ['D12.776.828'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.875', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.875', 'D12.776.124.125.662.768', 'D23.119.970'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.910', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.910', 'D12.776.124.125.662.884']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
17443,[Spontaneous ruptures of allotransplants of human cadaveric kidneys].,On the basis of morphological data it was established that spontaneous ruptures of allotransplanted kidneys of man were connected mainly with juxtamedullar shunting of their blood flow; Impairment of the blood flow was apparently caused both by immune and nonimmune endogenous humoral factors.

3418,Colonization by fragments of the submerged macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum under different sediment type and density conditions.,"In this paper, the effect of plant density, sediment type, and macrophyte fragment size on the fragment colonization ability of Myriophyllum spicatum was evaluated in an outdoor experiment. The relative growth rate (RGR) was higher in the mud and low-density treatments than in the sand and high-density treatments. The relative elongation rate (RER) decreased with increasing density and fragment size, with RER values being much higher in the mud than the sand treatments. Both branching number and shoot diameter increased with decreasing density and increasing fragment size, and were significantly higher in the mud than the sand treatments. The shoot : root ratio was higher in the mud treatments than in the sand treatments. Total N content in both the shoot and root was significantly higher in the mud and low-density treatments than in the sand and high-density treatments. Shoot P content only decreased with increasing density, while root P content was higher in the mud and low-density treatments than in the sand and high-density treatments. These data indicate that fragment colonization by M. spicatum is improved by large fragments, low density, and nutrient-rich sediments, and that these conditions contribute to the rapid population expansion of this species.","['Aquatic Organisms', 'Introduced Species', 'Magnoliopsida', 'Plant Shoots', 'Reproduction', 'Rhizome', 'Seeds']",26134529,"[['B05.080', 'G16.500.275.725.500.650.075'], ['B01.050.050.580', 'G16.500.275.157.049.400', 'N06.230.124.049.400'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250'], ['A18.024.875'], ['G08.686.784'], ['A18.024.937.750', 'A18.400.750'], ['A18.024.500.750', 'G07.203.300.775', 'J02.500.775']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
43499,Spatial and temporal sensitivity degradation of primary visual cortical cells in senescent rhesus monkeys.,"Human visual function declines with age. Much of this decline is mediated by changes in the central visual pathways. In this study we compared the spatial and temporal sensitivities of striate cortical cells in young and old paralysed macaque monkeys. Extracellular single-unit recordings were employed. Our results show that cortical neurons in old monkeys exhibit lower optimal spatial and temporal frequencies, lower spatial resolution and lower high temporal frequency cut-offs than do cells in young adult monkeys. These changes in old monkeys are accompanied by increased visually evoked responses, increased spontaneous activities and decreased signal-to-noise ratios. The increased excitability of cells in old animals is consistent with an age-related degeneration of intracortical inhibition. The degradation of spatial and temporal function in old striate cortex should contribute to the decline in visual function that accompanies normal aging.","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Vision, Ocular', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception']",18616566,"[['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.510.550'], ['E05.723.729'], ['F02.830.816.964', 'G02.111.820.480.900', 'G04.835.480.900', 'G11.561.790.964', 'G14.935'], ['A08.612.220.860'], ['F02.463.593.932']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The purified fraction after gel filtration indicated three bands at 68, 54, and 43 kilodaltons on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This fraction enhanced the adenylate cyclase activity of HeLa cell membranes by 1.5-fold over that of the control. The study with anti-cholera toxin immunoglobulin G (IgG) and ganglioside affinity column chromatographies revealed that the eluent from the anti-cholera toxin IgG column chromatography exhibited a single band (68 kDa) on SDS-PAGE and native PAGE, whereas the eluent from ganglioside column chromatography exhibited two bands (68 and 54 kDa) on SDS-PAGE. These suggest that the 68-kDa polypeptide should have an immunological relationship with cholera toxin, and the 68- and 54-kDa polypeptides might be responsible for the recognition of ganglioside.","['Adenylyl Cyclases', 'Campylobacter fetus', 'Cholera Toxin', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enterotoxins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Immunotoxins']",2370099,"[['D08.811.520.650.200', 'D12.644.360.050', 'D12.776.476.050'], ['B03.440.180.325', 'B03.660.150.235.250.500.220'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.115.180', 'D23.946.123.194', 'D23.946.330.150'], ['E05.196.181.400.170'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['D23.946.330'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['D12.776.124.790.651.114.580.450', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.580.450', 'D27.888.569.257.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
19240,Biologic activity of oligonucleotides with polarity and anomeric center reversal.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E6 and E7 inactivate the tumor suppressors p53 and pRB, respectively. Both viral oncoproteins play important roles in maintaining the transformed phenotype of cells. In this study, we examine the effects of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides with polarity and anomeric center reversal (alpha/beta-ODNs). ODNs of the general structure 5'alphaN3'3'NNN5'5'alphaN3'3'NNNN5'5'alphaN3+ ++'3'N5' were synthesized using phosphoramidite DNA chemistry. These alpha/beta-ODNs were complementary in sequence to regions flanking the start codons of HPV type 16 E6 and E7 genes. The anti-HPV type 16 alpha/beta-ODNs were able to form stable duplexes with their complementary RNA, which then serve as substrates for RNase H hydrolysis. Anti-HPV type 16 alpha/beta-ODNs also specifically inhibited the growth of two cervical carcinoma cell lines, CaSki and SiHa, both of which harbor HPV type 16 DNA. A decrease in E7 protein expression was also observed. Injection of nude mice with SiHa cells induces tumors. Treatment of these tumor-bearing mice with anti-HPV type 16 alpha/beta-ODNs led to substantially smaller tumors. These results show that alpha/beta-ODNs can exert antisense activities both in vitro and in vivo on the E6 and E7 genes of HPV type 16.","['Animals', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Division', 'Codon', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA, Viral', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral', 'Oncogenes', 'Papillomaviridae', 'Papillomavirus E7 Proteins', 'Papillomavirus Infections', 'RNA, Viral', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Ribonuclease H', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Virus Infections', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms', 'Viral Structural Proteins']",9593047,"[['B01.050'], ['C04.557.470.200'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['D13.444.735.544.355', 'G05.360.335.355', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.190'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['G05.308.385'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.364.875', 'G05.360.340.358.024.875', 'G05.360.340.358.840.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['E05.624'], ['E05.393.661', 'G02.111.611'], ['D13.150.480', 'D13.444.600.150.640', 'D13.695.578.424.480', 'D27.720.470.530.600.150.640'], ['D12.776.624.664.520', 'D12.776.964.700'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500'], ['B04.280.210.655', 'B04.613.204.655'], ['D12.776.624.664.520.420'], ['C01.925.256.650', 'C01.925.928.725'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['D12.776.260.703', 'D12.776.930.780'], ['D08.811.277.352.355.350.700', 'D08.811.277.352.700.350.700'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997'], ['A11.251.860'], ['C01.925.928'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.850', 'C13.351.500.852.593.131', 'C13.351.500.852.762.850', 'C13.351.937.418.875.850'], ['D12.776.964.970']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2225,Value of serum IgG subclasses in the prognosis of asthma in children with immunotherapy treatment.,"Immunotherapy is an empirical treatment with proven clinical efficacy. Different results have been found when comparing the levels of the subclasses for immunoglobulin G and the clinical development during immunotherapy. A follow up study was carried out for one year on the IgG subclasses in 21 asthmatic children of both sexes and ages ranging from 8 to 11 years. The children were sensitized to Dermatophagoides Pteronyssinus and had undergone immunotherapy treatment. The clinical and analytical evaluation were carried out before treatment was started and later every four months. In terms of clinical evolution, the children were separated into two groups. The levels of IgG1 show different evolution in terms of a good or not good clinical evolution with a p of 0.056. Levels of IgG2 showed no differences. IgG3 shows a disorderly distribution. A continuous increase in IgG4 levels was observed from the start of immunotherapy though no differences in terms of clinical evolution were recorded. With the results obtained, it can be concluded that the gradual increase of IgG4 together with an early rise in IgG1 levels are related to the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy.","['Allergens', 'Animals', 'Asthma', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunotherapy', 'Male', 'Mites', 'Prognosis']",9111871,"[['D23.050.063'], ['B01.050'], ['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['D23.101'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.312', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.312', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.312'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['E02.095.465.425'], ['B01.050.500.131.166.132.419'], ['E01.789']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
20020,Awake craniotomy under local anaesthesia and monitored conscious sedation for resection of brain tumours in eloquent cortex--outcomes in 20 patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Resection or even biopsy of an intra-axial mass lesion in close relationship to eloquent cortex carries a major risk of neurological deficit. We review the safety and effectiveness of craniotomy under local anaesthesia and monitored conscious sedation for resection of mass lesions involving eloquent cortex.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a 3-year retrospective review of patients who underwent awake craniotomy under local anaesthesia at the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore. All patients had tumours in close proximity to eloquent cortex, including speech areas in the dominant hemisphere as well as primary sensory and motor cortex in either hemisphere. Brain mapping was performed by direct cortical stimulation using the Ojemann stimulator to identify a safe corridor for surgical approach to the tumour. Intraoperative physiological monitoring was carried out by assessment of speech, motor and sensory functions during the process of surgical resection. All resections were evaluated and verified by postoperative imaging and reviewed by an independent assessor. Postoperative complications and neurological deficits, as well as extent of tumour resection, were evaluated.RESULTS: A total of 20 patients underwent stereotactic resection over a period of 3 years from July 2003 to August 2006. There were 7 male patients and 13 female patients, with a mean age of 39.8 years. The average length of stay was 5.5 days. There were no major anaesthetic complications and no perioperative deaths. Postoperative neurological deficits were seen in 6 patients (30%) and this was permanent in only 1 patient (5%). The degree of cytoreduction achieved was greater than 90% in 58% of patients and a further 21% had greater than 80% cytoreduction.CONCLUSION: Tumour surgery with conscious sedation in combination with frameless computer stereotactic guidance is a safe technique that allows maximal resection of lesions in close relationship to eloquent cortex and has a low risk of neurological deficit.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anesthetics, Local', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Child', 'Conscious Sedation', 'Craniotomy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medical Audit', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Perioperative Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Singapore']",17549278,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['C04.588.614.250.195', 'C10.228.140.211', 'C10.551.240.250'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E03.250'], ['E04.525.190'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.761.700.250.500', 'N05.700.175.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['E02.760.731', 'E04.604', 'N02.421.585.722'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['Z01.252.145.774']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
5853,Neonatal short bowel syndrome: population-based estimates of incidence and mortality rates.,"BACKGROUND: Congenital or acquired neonatal short bowel syndrome (SBS) carries significant morbidity and mortality rates. No accurate population estimates of incidence and mortality exist because of differences in definition, follow-up, and regional referral patterns.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed involving 175 surgical neonates admitted to our institution from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1999 and followed up until July 1, 2001. Institution and population-based estimates of incidence and mortality were performed using postcensal population figures (1997) from Statistics Canada.RESULTS: The overall incidence of SBS was 22.1 per 1,000 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions (95% CI = 15.3, 28.9) and 24.5 per 100,000 live births (95% CI = 12.1, 36.9). The incidence was much greater in premature infants (less than 37 weeks). The SBS case fatality rate was 37.5% (95% CI = 22.5, 52.5) and the cause-specific and proportional mortality rates (for children less than 4 years old) were 2.0 of 100,000 population per year (0.4 to 3.6/100,000/year) and 1.4% (0.3% to 2.6%), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neonatal SBS pose a complex management challenge and are responsible for a significant cost to the health care system. To our knowledge, this study represents the first population-based estimates for neonatal SBS incidence and mortality rates. Accurate estimates will assist clinicians in counseling parents, allocating resources, and planning clinical trials.","['Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Ontario', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Short Bowel Syndrome']",15137001,"[['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['Z01.107.567.176.639'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800', 'G17.680.750', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800'], ['C06.405.469.637.832', 'C23.550.767.882']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
8808,"Percutaneous absorption of benzoic acid across human skin. II. Prediction of an in vivo, skin-flap system using in vitro parameters.","The possibility of predicting the behavior of in vivo systems based on physical and chemical parameters determined by in vitro experiments is examined using benzoic acid. The physical and chemical parameters governing percutaneous absorption of benzoic acid--permeability, partition coefficient, and skin thickness--were determined by in vitro experiments as described in Ref. 1. These parameters were used, in combination with benzoic acid elimination kinetics, to predict the results of in vivo experiments using a comprehensive mathematical model. The in vivo system consists of a congenitally athymic (nude) rat with a surgically constructed human skin sandwich (HSSF) flap on which a donor cell is placed. To apply the in vitro parameters to an in vivo system requires a suitable pharmacokinetic model describing distribution and elimination for benzoic acid in the nude rat. Blood concentrations of benzoic acid following a bolus intravenous injection are closely described by a two-compartment open pharmacokinetic model with elimination occurring from only one compartment. The mathematical model of the rat-donor cell system combines this two-compartment model of the rat with a percutaneous absorption model to provide useful estimates of the measured in vivo blood levels. Comparisons of predicted and measured results suggest that the parameters determined by in vitro experimentation can be used to predict the behavior of complex in vivo systems, if a suitable mathematical model is available.","['Animals', 'Benzoates', 'Benzoic Acid', 'Diffusion', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Skin', 'Skin Absorption', 'Tissue Distribution']",2362908,"[['B01.050'], ['D02.241.223.100', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127'], ['D02.241.223.100.120', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.117'], ['G01.202', 'G02.196'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['E05.599.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['G09.330.100.780'], ['A17.815'], ['G03.015.500.750', 'G03.787.024.500.750', 'G07.690.725.015.500.750', 'G13.750.778'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7131,An analysis of India's 2017 National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants: The Social and Behavioural Sciences aspect.,"In this commentary on Section 9 (Social and Behavioural Sciences Research for Health) of the National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants (2017) by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), we appreciate that the guidelines clarify that human beings are ""research participants"" and not merely ""subjects"". Further, we appreciate and commend the ICMR for: i) contextualising the guidelines to India's unique sociocultural and economic situation and ii) affirming the multidisciplinary nature of health research and the wide scope of social and behavioural research. However, we question the prominence given to the difference between biomedical research and other aspects of health research and the description of social and psychological risks and discomforts as minor risks. Finally, we suggest that the guidelines would express greater value and diversity of the social aspects of health if they recommended wider representation of these aspects in the composition of research ethics committees.","['Behavioral Sciences', 'Biomedical Research', 'Ethical Review', 'Ethics Committees, Research', 'Ethics, Research', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Human Experimentation', 'Humans', 'India', 'Organizations', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk', 'Social Sciences', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",30211676,"[['F04.096'], ['H01.770.644.145'], ['K01.752.566.479.117', 'N05.350.250'], ['K01.752.566.479.147.750', 'N04.452.758.788.300.750', 'N05.350.268.750', 'N05.700.685.300.750'], ['K01.752.566.479.173', 'N05.350.670'], ['N04.761.700.350', 'N05.700.350'], ['E05.445', 'H01.770.644.145.365'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['N03.540'], ['M01.774'], ['E05.318.740.600.800', 'G17.680.750', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800'], ['F04.096.879', 'I01'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
4454,pH sensitivity of chlorophyll fluorescence quenching is determined by the detergent/protein ratio and the state of LHCII aggregation.,"Here we show how the protein environment in terms of detergent concentration/protein aggregation state, affects the sensitivity to pH of isolated, native LHCII, in terms of chlorophyll fluorescence quenching. Three detergent concentrations (200, 20 and 6ìM n-dodecyl â-d-maltoside) have been tested. It was found that at the detergent concentration of 6ìM, low pH quenching of LHCII is close to the physiological response to lumen acidification possessing pK of 5.5. The analysis has been conducted both using arbitrary PAM fluorimetry measurements and chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime component analysis. The second led to the conclusion that the 3.5ns component lifetime corresponds to an unnatural state of LHCII, induced by the detergent used for solubilising the protein, whilst the 2ns component is rather the most representative lifetime component of the conformational state of LHCII in the natural thylakoid membrane environment when the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was absent. The 2ns component is related to a pre-aggregated LHCII that makes it more sensitive to pH than the trimeric LHCII with the dominating 3.5ns lifetime component. The pre-aggregated LHCII displayed both a faster response to protons and a shift in the pK for quenching to higher values, from 4.2 to 4.9. We concluded that environmental factors like lipids, zeaxanthin and PsbS protein that modulate NPQ in vivo could control the state of LHCII aggregation in the dark that makes it more or less sensitive to the lumen acidification.

3492,A multi-stage shuttle run as a predictor of running performance and maximal oxygen uptake in adults.,"The aim of this study was to assess the validity of a 20 metre multi-stage shuttle run (20-MST) as both a field test of cardiorespiratory endurance and as a predictor of competitive performance in a 10 kilometre (10 km) race. Nine male subjects (age 35.4 +/- 5.8 years) (mean +/- SD) underwent a laboratory test of maximum oxygen uptake on a treadmill (VO2 max 59.0 +/- 9.9 ml.kg.-1min-1), completed the 20-MST (score 105 +/- 23.7 laps/11.4 +/- 2.7 paliers) and competed in a 10 km race (finishing time 41.8 +/- 7.3 minutes). Analysis using Pearson's Product Moment Coefficient revealed high correlations between these variables (20-MST vs. VO2 max, r = 0.93; 20-MST vs. 10 km, r = -0.93; VO2 max vs. 10 km, r = -0.95). These results confirm that the 20-MST is a valid field test of cardio-respiratory endurance and suggest that it can additionally be used to predict relative running performance over 10 km.","['Adult', 'Exercise Test', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Physical Endurance', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Running']",3435818,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G03.680'], ['G11.427.680', 'I03.450.642.845.054.600'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['G11.427.410.568.610', 'G11.427.410.698.277.750', 'I03.350.750', 'I03.450.642.845.610']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
4772,[The effect of anterior or posterior tibial tunnel placement of a soft tissue graft with a soft tissue interference screw on fixation biomechanics].,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the biomechanical characteristics of anterior or posterior tibial tunnel placement of the soft tissue graft with a soft tissue interference screw in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.METHODS: Twelve bovine tibiae and digital extensor tendons were divided into two homogeneously equal groups after they were stripped of all soft tissues. Tibial tunnels were prepared and digital extensor tendons were fixed at nonanatomic (apart from the joint) anterior (n=6, group I) or posterior (n=6, group II) tibial tunnel positions with a soft tissue metal interference screw, 9x30 mm in size. All the specimens were cycled 500 times from 50 to 250 N at 1 Hz frequency in a servo hydraulic test device, after which ultimate load-at-failure testing was performed at a rate of 20 mm/min.RESULTS: The mean screw insertion torque values were 8.2+/-2.4 Nm and 8.4+/-2.8 Nm in groups I and II, respectively (p=0.88). No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to graft displacement (1.9+/-0.8 mm vs 2.3+/-0.4 mm; p=0.38) and stiffness (132.7+/-10.9 N/mm vs 126.4+/-8.5 N/mm, p=0.98) at the end of cyclic loading.CONCLUSION: Our results show that the site of nonanatomic soft tissue graft fixation in the tibial tunnel (anterior or posterior) with a soft tissue interference screw do not affect the biomechanical parameters in ACL reconstruction.","['Animals', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Bone Screws', 'Cattle', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Tendons', 'Tibia']",16531702,"[['B01.050'], ['A02.513.514.100', 'A02.835.583.512.100', 'A10.165.669.514.100'], ['C26.558.554.213'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['E07.695.370.437', 'E07.858.442.660.460.437', 'E07.858.690.725.460.437'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['A02.880'], ['A02.835.232.043.650.883']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
37092,Etomidate and mortality in cirrhotic patients with septic shock.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical effects and outcomes of a single dose etomidate prior to intubation in the intensive care setting is controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association of a single dose effect of etomidate prior to intubation on the mortality of septic cirrhotic patients and the impact of the subsequent use of low dose hydrocortisone.METHODS: This is a nested-cohort study within a randomized double blind placebo controlled study evaluating the use of low dose hydrocortisone in cirrhotic septic patients. Cirrhotic septic patients ? 18 years were included in the study. Patients who received etomidate prior to intubation were compared to those who did not receive etomidate for all cause 28-day mortality as a primary outcome.RESULTS: Sixty two intubated patients out of the 75 patients randomized in the initial trial were eligible for this study. Twenty three of the 62 intubated patients received etomidate dose prior to intubation. Etomidate use was not associated with all cause 28-day mortality or hospital mortality but was associated with significantly higher ICU mortality (91% vs. 64% for etomidate and controls groups, respectively; p = 0.02). Etomidate patients who received subsequent doses of hydrocortisone required lower doses of vasopressors and had more vasopressor-free days but no improvement in mortality.CONCLUSIONS: In this group of septic cirrhotic patients with very high mortality, etomidate increased ICU mortality. Subsequent use of hydrocortisone appears to have no benefit beyond decreasing vasopressor requirements. The lowest mortality was observed in patients who did not receive etomidate but received hydrocortisone.","['Cohort Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Etomidate', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intubation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Shock, Septic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents']",22208901,"[['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['D03.383.129.308.265'], ['C23.550.355'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.400', 'N01.224.935.698.400', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.400', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['N02.278.388.493'], ['E02.585', 'E05.497'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C01.757.800', 'C23.550.470.790.500.800', 'C23.550.835.900.712'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D27.505.954.411.793']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
26749,Laparoscopic transumbilical cholecystectomy: surgical technique.,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally performed using 4 ports by transperitoneal access. Recent developments regarding laparoscopic surgery have been directed toward reducing the size or number of ports to achieve the goal of minimally invasive surgery, by minilaparoscopy, natural orifice access, and the transumbilical approach. The aim of this article is to describe our laparoscopic transumbilical cholecystectomy technique using conventional laparoscopic instruments and ports.METHODS: The Veress needle was placed through the umbilicus, which allowed carbon dioxide inflow. A 5-mm trocar was placed in the periumbilical site for the laparoscope followed by the placement of 2 additional 5-mm periumbilical trocars. The entire procedure was performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments. At the end of the surgery, trocars were removed, and all 3 periumbilical skin incisions were united for specimen retrieval.RESULTS: Five transumbilical cholecystectomies were performed following this technique. The mean BMI was 26.6 kg/m(2). The mean operative time and blood loss were 46.2 minutes and 55 mL, respectively. No intraoperative complications occurred. Analgesia was performed using dipyrone (1g IV q6h) and ketoprofen (100 mg IV q12 h). Time to first oral intake was 8 hours. Mean hospital stay was 19.2 hours.CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic transumbilical cholecystectomy seems to be feasible even using conventional laparoscopic instruments and can be considered a potential alternative for traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","['Adult', 'Biliary Tract Diseases', 'Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Umbilicus']",20042128,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C06.130'], ['E04.210.120.172.140', 'E04.502.250.520.160'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['A01.923.047.849']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
24580,The effectiveness of the '2-week wait' referral service for colorectal cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: The UK government target expects all suspected cancer patients to be seen within 2 weeks of referral made by general practitioners. This has significant impact on the workload for colorectal surgeons. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of this colorectal service.METHOD: A retrospective study of all patients referred to a 2-week wait colorectal clinic over a 12-month period was assessed, documenting diagnosis and staging. Comparison of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) presenting via other routes in the same period was made.RESULTS: Over the 12-month period, all 1100 patients were seen in the 2-week wait clinic; 938 (85%) patients fulfilled the referral criteria, but only 81 (7.3%) were diagnosed with cancer. Conversely, 136 CRC patients presented to the surgeons via urgent referrals (n = 86), emergency (n = 13), routine colorectal clinic (n = 19) and bowel screening (n = 18). The 2-week cohort had more advanced staging than those referred by standard letter and pilot screening. Cancers in the symptomatic population are predominantly Dukes' B and Dukes' C whereas in pilot screening group predominantly Dukes' A.CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of 2-week wait referral was poor, confirming its lack of validity. Further work is required to offer primary care stricter inclusion and exclusion referral criteria.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Program Evaluation', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Waiting Lists']",20946272,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['E01.390.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.337.820', 'N04.761.685', 'N05.715.360.650'], ['N04.452.758.849'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['N04.452.095.738']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

29606,"Hydroxycarbamide versus chronic transfusion for maintenance of transcranial doppler flow velocities in children with sickle cell anaemia-TCD With Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (TWiTCH): a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: For children with sickle cell anaemia and high transcranial doppler (TCD) flow velocities, regular blood transfusions can effectively prevent primary stroke, but must be continued indefinitely. The efficacy of hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) in this setting is unknown; we performed the TWiTCH trial to compare hydroxyurea with standard transfusions.METHODS: TWiTCH was a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial done at 26 paediatric hospitals and health centres in the USA and Canada. We enrolled children with sickle cell anaemia who were aged 4-16 years and had abnormal TCD flow velocities (? 200 cm/s) but no severe vasculopathy. After screening, eligible participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to continue standard transfusions (standard group) or hydroxycarbamide (alternative group). Randomisation was done at a central site, stratified by site with a block size of four, and an adaptive randomisation scheme was used to balance the covariates of baseline age and TCD velocity. The study was open-label, but TCD examinations were read centrally by observers masked to treatment assignment and previous TCD results. Participants assigned to standard treatment continued to receive monthly transfusions to maintain 30% sickle haemoglobin or lower, while those assigned to the alternative treatment started oral hydroxycarbamide at 20 mg/kg per day, which was escalated to each participant's maximum tolerated dose. The treatment period lasted 24 months from randomisation. The primary study endpoint was the 24 month TCD velocity calculated from a general linear mixed model, with the non-inferiority margin set at 15 cm/s. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of assigned treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01425307.FINDINGS: Between Sept 20, 2011, and April 17, 2013, 159 patients consented and enrolled in TWiTCH. 121 participants passed screening and were then randomly assigned to treatment (61 to transfusions and 60 to hydroxycarbamide). At the first scheduled interim analysis, non-inferiority was shown and the sponsor terminated the study. Final model-based TCD velocities were 143 cm/s (95% CI 140-146) in children who received standard transfusions and 138 cm/s (135-142) in those who received hydroxycarbamide, with a difference of 4·54 (0·10-8·98). Non-inferiority (p=8·82 ? 10(-16)) and post-hoc superiority (p=0·023) were met. Of 29 new neurological events adjudicated centrally by masked reviewers, no strokes were identified, but three transient ischaemic attacks occurred in each group. Magnetic resonance brain imaging and angiography (MRI and MRA) at exit showed no new cerebral infarcts in either treatment group, but worsened vasculopathy in one participant who received standard transfusions. 23 severe adverse events in nine (15%) patients were reported for hydroxycarbamide and ten serious adverse events in six (10%) patients were reported for standard transfusions. The most common serious adverse event in both groups was vaso-occlusive pain (11 events in five [8%] patients with hydroxycarbamide and three events in one [2%] patient for transfusions).INTERPRETATION: For high-risk children with sickle cell anaemia and abnormal TCD velocities who have received at least 1 year of transfusions, and have no MRA-defined severe vasculopathy, hydroxycarbamide treatment can substitute for chronic transfusions to maintain TCD velocities and help to prevent primary stroke.FUNDING: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health.","['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell', 'Antisickling Agents', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Substitution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea', 'Male', 'Stroke', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial']",26670617,"[['M01.060.057'], ['C15.378.071.141.150.150', 'C15.378.420.155', 'C16.320.070.150', 'C16.320.365.155'], ['D27.505.954.502.135'], ['E01.370.370.130', 'G09.330.380.630.080'], ['E02.095.135'], ['G09.330.100.159'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E02.186'], ['E02.319.307.312', 'N02.421.668.778.500.312'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.065.950.395'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.350.578.937.260.850', 'E01.370.350.700.560.260.850', 'E01.370.350.850.260.850', 'E01.370.350.850.850.870', 'E01.370.376.537.750.260.850', 'E05.629.937.260.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
48311,"Effects of Planting Date and Barley Variety on Russian Wheat Aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae) Populations in Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska.","The Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is an important pest in the western Great Plains of the United States, where it causes hundreds of millions of dollars of losses to barley and wheat production through reduced yields. Experiments to evaluate the effect of early planting and resistance in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) on D. noxia were conducted at Fort Collins, CO; Tribune, KS; and Sidney, NE, in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Treatments included two planting dates and four cultivars, the D. noxia-resistant barley cultivars 'Stoneham' (Otis*4/STARS 9577B) and 'Sidney' (Otis*4/STARS 9301B), the susceptible cultivar 'Otis', and Otis treated with thiamethoxam. In tiller samples collected from May through early July, consistently lower D. noxia populations were found in plots planted ?30 d earlier than normal at Fort Collins in all three years, and at Tribune in 2007. With one location-year exception, lower D. noxia populations occurred on plants of resistant varieties or the susceptible variety Otis treated with thiamethoxam than on untreated Otis plants. There were no significant differences in D. noxia populations produced on plants of either resistant variety and susceptible Otis plants treated with thiamethoxam. Interactions between resistant varieties and early planting resulted in reduced D. noxia populations at Fort Collins in 2007 and 2009, and at Tribune and Sidney in 2007. Planting D. noxia-resistant barley varieties, planting varieties earlier than normal, and the synergistic effect of resistant variety and early planting can significantly reduce D. noxia infestations on barley in the western High Plains.","['Animals', 'Aphids', 'Colorado', 'Herbivory', 'Hordeum', 'Insect Control', 'Kansas', 'Nebraska', 'Population Dynamics', 'Seasons']",26309288,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.412.165'], ['Z01.107.567.875.760.210'], ['F01.145.113.547.600', 'F01.145.407.758', 'G07.203.650.353.758'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.481'], ['N06.850.780.200.650.425'], ['Z01.107.567.875.510.390'], ['Z01.107.567.875.510.520'], ['I01.240.600', 'N01.224.625', 'N06.850.505.400.700'], ['G01.910.645.661', 'G16.500.275.071.590', 'N06.230.300.100.250.525']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
25661,Orbital venous approach to the cavernous sinus: an analysis of the facial and orbital venous system.,"Carotid-cavernous fistulas are abnormal communications between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus produced by a rupture of the wall of the carotid artery or one of its branches into the sinus. Extradural branches of the internal or external carotid arteries may communicate with the cavernous sinus, producing proptosis, progressive glaucoma, and ocular vascular engorgement. Various approaches to obliterate these fistulas have evolved, many of which carry high morbidity or are precluded by anatomical considerations. Analysis of the venous anatomy of the orbit and face, including human cadaver dissections, reveals a new and safe approach to the cavernous sinus, requiring microsurgical isolation and cannulation of the superior ophthalmic vein through an anterior orbital approach. Selective embolization of a carotid-cavernous fistula can be performed successfully through this route. We present pertinent anatomy and technical considerations and the successful clinical application of these principles. Surgeons familiar with craniofacial anatomy and microvascular techniques can apply these principles and play an active role in the treatment of these complex problems.","['Aged', 'Arteriovenous Fistula', 'Carotid Artery, Internal', 'Cavernous Sinus', 'Face', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Orbit', 'Veins']",7810953,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C14.240.850.750.147', 'C14.240.850.984.750', 'C14.907.150.125', 'C14.907.933.555', 'C16.131.240.850.750.125', 'C23.300.575.950.250'], ['A07.015.114.186.200.230'], ['A07.015.908.224.334'], ['A01.456.505'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.690'], ['A07.015.908']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
28979,Tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: a population-based study in Iceland.,"BACKGROUND: The tall cell variant (TCV) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is an aggressive variant of PTC that is believed to have worse outcomes than classical PTC. The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence, survival, and disease recurrence of patients with TCV and compare them with other PTC in a whole population.METHODS: Information on all thyroid carcinomas diagnosed in Iceland from 1990 to 2009 was obtained from the Icelandic Cancer Registry. PTC diagnosed postmortem was excluded. The date of diagnosis, sex, and age at diagnosis were registered. All histopathology material was re-evaluated, and papillary thyroid tumors classified as either TCV or other types of PTC. Tumors were classified as TCV if >50% of cells were tall (height > twice the width). TNM stage was determined for all the cases. Endpoints were thyroid cancer-specific death and thyroid cancer recurrence.RESULTS: Out of 376 patients diagnosed with PTC in the study period, 49 (13%) were classified as TCV. Patients with TCV were older (66 years vs. 49 years, p<0.001), more often had pT4 tumors (71% vs. 15%, p<0.001), had higher rates of nodal metastasis (51% vs. 22%, p<0.001), and more often distant metastasis (14% vs. 2%, p<0.001). The age-adjusted incidence of TCV for men was 0.5/100,000 [confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.7] and for women 0.7/100,000 [CI 0.4-1.0] between 1990 and 2009. The five-year disease-specific survival for TCV was 83% [CI 68-91] compared to 98% [CI 96-99] for other PTC respectively (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, TCV histology was an independent risk factor for recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) 3.18 [CI 1.48-6.84]) but not for disease specific survival (HR 1.86 [CI 0.77-4.73]).CONCLUSIONS: TCV comprises 13% of all diagnosed PTC in Iceland with an incidence of 0.5/100,000 for men and 0.7/100,000 for women. Patients diagnosed with TCV have worse five-year disease-specific survival than patients with other PTC. TCV histology is an independent risk factor for disease recurrence but not for disease-specific survival.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Papillary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iceland', 'Incidence', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Thyroid Neoplasms', 'Young Adult']",25322334,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075.100', 'N06.850.490.250.100'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.557.470.200.360', 'C04.557.470.700.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.542.816.249', 'Z01.639.490'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['C04.588.322.894', 'C04.588.443.915', 'C19.344.894', 'C19.874.788'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

19188,Trust Model for Protection of Personal Health Data in a Global Environment.,"Successful health care, eHealth, digital health, and personal health systems increasingly take place in cross-jurisdictional, dynamic and risk-encumbered information space. They require rich amount of personal health information (PHI). Trust is and will be the cornerstone and prerequisite for successful health services. In global environments, trust cannot be expected as granted. In this paper, health service in the global environment is perceived as a meta-system, and a trust management model is developed to support it.

11342,Physical activity in daily life in patients with chronic low back pain.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate disuse (ie, a decreased daily physical activity level) in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) and to evaluate the construct validity of accelerometry for measuring physical activity in daily life.DESIGN: Case-control study in a cross-sectional design; comparison of accelerometry to the criterion standard (doubly labeled water technique).SETTING: Normal daily living (unrestricted by the measurement devices).PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with chronic nonspecific LBP and 13 age- and gender-matched healthy controls.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical activity in daily life, expressed as whole-body acceleration measured with a triaxial accelerometer (Tracmor), and as the ratio between average daily metabolic rate (ADMR), measured by the doubly labeled water technique, and resting metabolic rate (RMR), measured by the ventilated hood. Both techniques were used simultaneously for 14 days.RESULTS: Mean physical activity level in patients and controls did not differ significantly. The correlation between the Tracmor and ADMR and RMR was .72 (p < .01).CONCLUSIONS: Decreased physical activity levels in this sample of chronic LBP patients was not confirmed. The Tracmor is a valid instrument for measuring daily activity in LBP patients.","['Activities of Daily Living', 'Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Deuterium Oxide', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Low Back Pain', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",11387574,"[['E02.760.169.063.500.067', 'E02.831.067', 'I03.050', 'N02.421.784.110'], ['G02.111.130', 'G03.180', 'G07.100.049'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['D01.045.250.875.200', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650.200', 'D01.268.406.500.250', 'D01.362.340.500.250'], ['G03.295'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.592.612.107.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
48507,The Nrf2 activator tBHQ inhibits T cell activation of primary human CD4 T cells.,"The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates a battery of antioxidant, detoxification, and cell stress genes. It is activated by oxidative stress and a number of exogenous compounds, one of which is tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a widely used food preservative. Nrf2 modulates immune responses in numerous rodent models of inflammation, but its effects on human immune cells are not well characterized. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the effects of the Nrf2 activator tBHQ on early events of T cell activation in primary human cells. Treatment with tBHQ induced mRNA expression of the Nrf2 target genes HMOX-1, GCLC, and NQO1, and also increased NRF2 mRNA expression, albeit to a lesser extent than the other target genes. tBHQ decreased production of the cytokines IL-2 and IFN-ã at both the protein and mRNA levels after stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and to an even greater extent in isolated CD4 T cells. Likewise, tBHQ decreased induction of CD25 and CD69 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and this decrease was even more marked in isolated CD4 T cells. In addition, tBHQ inhibited induction of NFêB DNA binding in anti-CD3/anti-CD28-activated PBMCs. Collectively, these data suggest that tBHQ inhibits activation of primary human CD4 T cells, which correlates with activation of Nrf2 and inhibition of NFêB DNA binding. Although these studies suggest the food additive tBHQ negatively impacts T cell activation, further studies will be needed to fully elucidate the effect of tBHQ on human immune responses.","['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antioxidants', 'CD28 Antigens', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cytokines', 'DNA', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2', 'NF-kappa B', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Binding']",25484350,"[['D23.050.301.264.035', 'D23.101.100.110'], ['D23.050.301.264.894', 'D23.101.100.894'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.222.500', 'D23.050.301.264.894.128', 'D23.101.100.894.128'], ['D23.050.301.264.894.095', 'D23.101.100.894.095'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.393'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.420.320.500'], ['D12.776.503.280'], ['A11.118.637.555', 'A15.145.229.637.555', 'A15.382.490.555'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['D12.776.260.108.737', 'D12.776.930.127.737'], ['D05.500.672', 'D12.776.260.600', 'D12.776.660.600', 'D12.776.930.600'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
29977,Neurotensin enhances endogenous extracellular glutamate levels in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons: involvement of neurotensin receptor in NMDA induced excitotoxicity.,"Primary cultures of cortical neurons were employed to investigate the modulatory effects of neurotensin on glutamate excitotoxicity and the possible neuroprotective actions of the neurotensin receptor antagonist SR48692. NT(1-13) and its biologically active fragment NT(8-13) at 10 nM (30 min) increased endogenous glutamate levels. The inactive fragment NT(1-7) (10-100 nM; 30 min) was ineffective. SR48692, applied 20 min before NT and maintained in contact with cells during NT exposure as well as a low calcium medium (from the onset of the experiment) prevented the NT(1-13)-induced increase in extracellular glutamate levels. The addition of NMDA (0.01-10 micro M; 10 min) to the medium concentration-dependently increased extracellular glutamate levels. When 0.1 nM NT(1-13) was added in combination with 0.01 micro M NMDA, in concentrations by themselves ineffective, a significant increase in glutamate levels was observed. SR48692 at 100 nM counteracted the increase in glutamate levels induced by 0.1 nM NT(1-13) plus 0.01 micro M NMDA. The inhibitor of the protein kinase C (PKC) calphostin C (0.1 micro M; 10 min before NT) prevented the increase in glutamate levels induced by the combined treatments. The morphological analysis indicated that 10 nM NT(1-13) enhanced the glutamate (10 min)-induced apoptosis. The peptide was added 30 min prior to glutamate and maintained in contact with cells during the glutamate exposure. The presence of 100 nM SR48692 (20 min before NT) antagonized this effect of NT(1-13). These findings support the view of a pathophysiological role for NT in the cerebral cortex. Thus, under pathological conditions NT by enhancing glutamate outflow and by amplifying the NMDA-mediated glutamate signaling may be involved in increasing the degeneration of cortical neurons.","['Animals', 'Bisbenzimidazole', 'Calcium', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Chromatin', 'Coloring Agents', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists', 'Extracellular Space', 'Glutamic Acid', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Naphthalenes', 'Neurons', 'Neurotensin', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Pyrazoles', 'Quinolines', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Neurotensin']",15028650,"[['B01.050'], ['D03.633.100.103.145'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['A11.251'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['A11.284.430.106.279.345.190.160.180', 'D12.776.664.224', 'G05.360.160.180'], ['D27.720.233'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['D27.505.519.625.190.200', 'D27.505.696.577.190.200'], ['A10.082.500', 'A11.284.295'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['D12.125.067.500.400', 'D12.125.119.170.400'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.638', 'D04.615.638'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D12.644.400.550', 'D12.776.631.650.550'], ['C10.720', 'C25.723.705'], ['D12.644.541'], ['D03.383.129.539'], ['D03.633.100.810'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.550', 'D12.776.543.750.720.600.560', 'D12.776.543.750.750.555.560']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

22755,Suppressors of RNA silencing encoded by tomato leaf curl betasatellites.,"Virus encoded RNA-silencing suppressors (RSSs) are the key components evolved by the viruses to counter RNA-silencing defense of plants. Whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses infecting tomato crop code for five different proteins, ORF AC4, ORF AC2 and ORF AV2 in DNA-A component, ORF BV1 in DNA-B and ORF beta C1 in satellite DNA beta which  are predicted to function as silencing suppressors. In the present study suppressor function of ORF beta C1 of three betasatellites Tomato leaf curl Bangalore betasatellite ToLCBB-[IN:Hess:08], Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite CLCuMB-[IN:Sri:02] and Luffa leaf distortion betasatellite LuLDB-[IN:Lu:04] were examined. Agroinfiltration of GFP-silenced Nicotiana tabaccum cv. Xanthi with the cells expressing betaC1 protein resulted in reversal of silenced GFP expression. GFP-siRNA level was more than 50-fold lower compared to silenced plants in plants infiltrated with betaC1 gene from ToLCBB. However, in the case of 35S-beta C1 CLCuMB and 35S- beta C1 LuLDB construct, although GFP was expressed, siRNA level was not reduced, indicating that the step at which beta C1 interfere in RNA-silencing pathway is different.","['Agrobacterium tumefaciens', 'Animals', 'Begomovirus', 'DNA, Satellite', 'DNA, Viral', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, Suppressor', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hemiptera', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Plant Diseases', 'Plant Leaves', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Tobacco']",23385812,"[['B03.440.400.425.700.024.050', 'B03.660.050.662.024.500'], ['B01.050'], ['B04.280.350.100', 'B04.715.270.100'], ['D13.444.308.480', 'G02.111.570.080.708.800.150', 'G05.360.080.708.800.150', 'G05.360.340.024.220.150', 'G05.360.340.024.850.150'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.435'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.460'], ['G05.360.337'], ['D12.776.532.265'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.412'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.908.500.322'], ['G15.610'], ['A18.024.812'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.908.500.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
21077,Protective effect of O-phenanthroline against mechlorethamine toxicity in the rat liver slice system and in the guinea pig skin.,"The effect of O-phenanthroline (OP) on mechlorethamine hydrochloride (HN2) toxicity was studied in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Incubation of HN2 with the in vitro rat liver slice system resulted in leakage of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in a time-dependent manner. Exposure of the slices to HN2 for 4 h caused 79.2% ALT leakage. In the presence of OP enzyme leakage was reduced to 28.7%. OP-induced protection was shown to be dose dependent. Other metal chelators such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) had a weak effect on HN2 cytotoxicity. The protective activity of OP was also demonstrated in in vivo skin toxicity studies in the guinea pig. The ulcerative effect of topically applied HN2 was inhibited by OP even when applied 10 min following the alkylator. Histology of NH2-treated skin showed epidermal ulceration associated with a covering layer of encrusted exudate. However, only a slight diffuse acanthosis of the epidermal layer was observed when OP was applied for 10 min after the vesicant. It is suggested that OP may be used for the prevention of tissue damage caused by antineoplastic treatment with nitrogen mustard. It might also be employed in military medicine as an antidote to the chemical weapon sulfur mustard.","['Animals', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine', 'Phenanthrolines', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Skin']",1747067,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['E05.481'], ['D27.505.519.914.500.410', 'D27.720.832.500.410'], ['A03.620'], ['D02.455.526.728.650.529'], ['D03.633.300.669'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['A17.815']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
35973,Self-report and objective measures of ADHD-related behaviors in parents of preschool children at risk for ADHD.,"OBJECTIVE: Few studies have used a combination of objective and self-report measures to examine neuropsychological and behavioral functioning in parents of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study examined attention and inhibitory control in the parents of preschool children who were rated as ""at risk"" for developing ADHD as compared with parents of controls.METHODS: Preschool children (N=53) were divided into at risk for ADHD and control groups based on parent and teacher ratings of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition ADHD symptoms. One parent of each child was administered an identical pairs Continuous Performance Test (CPT-IP), a Go/No-Go task, and the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale for Adults.RESULTS: Parents of preschoolers at risk for ADHD showed a pattern of responding on measures of vigilance characterized by slower reaction times and increased commission errors as compared with parents of controls. There were no significant group differences on self-report measures on the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale for Adults.CONCLUSION: Parents of preschoolers at risk for ADHD appear to exhibit cognitive processing deficits that may not be evident using self-report measures. Further research is needed to more clearly identify the specific nature of these neuropsychological deficits and to determine whether they have a negative impact on their children.","['Adult', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity', 'Child', 'Child of Impaired Parents', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Humans', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Parents', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Assessment']",15337861,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F03.625.094.150'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.106'], ['F03.615.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.711.513'], ['F01.829.263.500.320', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340', 'M01.620'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.752.747.792.537']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

18577,Estrogen receptor status and adjuvant polychemotherapy or antiestrogen therapy in patients with high-risk breast cancer.,"This pilot study includes 115 consecutive patients admitted in the period from 1978 to 1981. Patients eligible for this study were at high risk according to the TNM classification with stages pT1-pT3 and pN+, MO. Primary therapy included modified radical mastectomy and axillary-node clearance, one or more ipsilateral nodes being involved in routine histology. All tumors were assayed for estrogen and progesterone receptors. According to the result of the estrogen receptor assay, estrogen-receptor-positive patients were treated with Tamoxifen 30 mg/day for a period of 2 years. Estrogen-receptor-negative patients were treated with cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil or adriblastin, cytoxan. After a median observation time of 36 months, overall there have been 31 recurrences: 9 = 17.3% in the estrogen-receptor-positive group and 22 = 34.9% in the estrogen-receptor-negative group. The analysis of different subgroups showed no significant differences, either in relation to axillary lymph-node status or in relation to menopausal status in the endocrine-treated compared with the polychemotherapy group. This result suggests, especially in the subgroup of patients with involvement of one to three axillary nodes, that estrogen-receptor-positive and estrogen-receptor-negative patients should be considered as separate groups when adjuvant therapy is indicated. Possibly hormone-receptor-positive patients may benefit from endocrine therapy and do not need polychemotherapy.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Tamoxifen']",6736112,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['E02.186'], ['D06.347.295', 'D27.505.696.399.450.327'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789'], ['D12.776.826.750.350', 'D12.776.930.778.350'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.150.700.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
5971,An active-site cysteine of sorghum leaf NADP-malate dehydrogenase studied by site-directed mutagenesis.,"The chloroplast NADP-malate dehydrogenase is activated through the reduction of two different disulfides per subunit. The activated enzyme, as well as a permanently active mutant where all four regulatory cysteines were replaced are still sensitive to thiol reagents. This observation suggested the presence of an additional important cysteine at the active site. In an attempt to identify that cysteine, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the cDNA encoding sorghum leaf NADP-malate dehydrogenase. The replacement of Cys-175 by an alanine yielded an enzyme whose sensitivity to thiol reagents was markedly decreased whereas its catalytic activity was enhanced. This finding suggests that Cys-175 has no catalytic function but is located close to the active site.","['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cysteine', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Iodoacetamide', 'Kinetics', 'Malate Dehydrogenase', 'Malate Dehydrogenase (NADP+)', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Plant Leaves', 'Poaceae', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Sulfhydryl Reagents']",8612735,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['D02.886.030.230', 'D02.886.489.155', 'D12.125.154.299', 'D12.125.166.230'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D02.065.064.400', 'D02.241.081.018.110.400', 'D02.241.081.018.487.249', 'D02.455.526.581.247.249'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D08.811.682.047.820.496'], ['D08.811.682.047.820.498'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.494'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['A18.024.812'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['D27.720.470.410.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
12098,Living with incomprehensible fatigue after recent myocardial infarction.,"AIM: This paper is a report of a study of what fatigue means to patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI) and how they manage to deal with the consequences of this symptom.BACKGROUND: After MI, fatigue is a frequent and distressing symptom. In nursing practice and in everyday conversations, the term 'tiredness' has a broad meaning that is often used synonymously with fatigue. Fatigue may be defined as a state along an adaptation continuum with tiredness and exhaustion as distinct states at the ends of the continuum.METHOD: In accordance with a constructivist grounded theory method, 19 patients were interviewed four months after having a MI. The informants were chosen from a larger sample of patients admitted to a coronary care unit during the period October 2005 to September 2006.FINDINGS: Living with incomprehensible fatigue was identified as the central theme, which described what fatigue meant to patients 4 months after their MI and how they handled it. The core category was labelled incomprehensible fatigue. Two of the categories refer to consequences: being restricted and feeling defeated and one category describes management: fumbling coping strategies. Finally, one category concerns the outcome: moderate relief of fatigue.CONCLUSION: Nursing interventions could focus on identifying and reducing stressors as well as on increasing patients' ability to cope with stressors. Further research should focus on identifying stressors and useful coping strategies after MI, knowledge that could be used to prevent aggravation of fatigue.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Rural', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Quality of Life', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors']",19146515,"[['F01.058'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C23.888.369'], ['N02.278.421.518'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['F01.145.126.990', 'F02.830.900'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
25033,Prevalence and incidence of Q-wave unrecognized myocardial infarction in general population: Diagnostic value of the electrocardiogram. The REGICOR study.,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of unrecognized myocardial infarction (UMI) remains an open question in epidemiological and clinical studies, inhibiting effective secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. We aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of Q-wave UMI in asymptomatic individuals aged 35 to 74years, and to ascertain the positive predictive value (PPV) of asymptomatic Q-wave to diagnose UMI.METHODS: Two population-based cross-sectional studies were conducted, in 2000 (with 10-year follow-up) and in 2005. A baseline electrocardiogram was obtained for each participant. Imaging techniques (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computerized tomography) were used to confirm UMI in patients with asymptomatic Q-wave.RESULTS: The prevalence of confirmed Q-wave UMI in the 5580 participants was 0.18% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10-0.33) and the incidence rate was 27.1 Q-wave UMI per 100,000person-years. The proportion of confirmed Q-wave UMI with respect to all prevalent MI was 8.1% (95% CI: 4.4-14.2). The PPV of asymptomatic Q-wave to diagnose Q-wave UMI was 29.2% (95% CI: 18.2-43.2%) overall, but much higher (75%, 95% CI: 40.9-92.9%) in participants with 10-year CHD risk ?10%, compared to lower-risk participants.CONCLUSION: Opportunistic identification of asymptomatic Q-waves by routine electrocardiogram overestimates actual Q-wave UMI, which represents 8% to 13% of all myocardial infarction in the population aged 35 to 74years. This overestimation is particularly high in the population at low cardiovascular risk. In epidemiological studies and in clinical practice, diagnosis of a pathologic Q-wave in asymptomatic patients requires detailed analysis of imaging tests to confirm or rule out myocardial necrosis.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Registries']",27744207,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
28599,"Expression and activation of P38 MAP kinase in invasive ductal breast cancers: correlation with expression of the estrogen receptor, HER2 and downstream signaling phosphorylated proteins.","MAP kinase signaling proteins have major implications in the molecular oncogenesis of breast cancers and have been extensively investigated as putative targets for therapy. This study reports the investigation of the expression of P38 MAPK and its phosphorylated form (p-P38 MAPK) in clinical specimens of invasive breast carcinomas and their correlation with estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 expression, as well as MAPK and PI3 kinase-AKT pathway signaling phosphorylated proteins. Expression levels of P38 MAPK and p-P38 MAPK as well as p-AKT, p-GSK3â, p-S6 kinase, p-MEK1 and p-ERK1/2 were quantitatively assessed using multiplex bead immunoassay in frozen specimens from 45 invasive ductal breast cancers. Twenty-nine specimens were ER+, 15 were HER2+ and 10 were triple‑negative breast cancers (TNBCs). P38 MAPK was found to be expressed in all tumor specimens and was significantly (P=0.002) overexpressed in ER+ tumors. P38 MAPK expression was lower in TNBCs than in all of the other tumors. The median expression of p-P38 MAPK was also higher in ER+ tumors while lower in the TNBCs. HER2 status had no effect on P38 MAPK and p-P38 MAPK expression. No variation in the phosphorylation rate of P38 MAPK was observed in relation with ER, HER2 or TNBC status. Significantly higher (P=0.0048) expression of p-AKT was observed in HER2+ tumors. No significant difference in p-MEK1, p-GSK3â and p-S6K expression was found in any other comparisons based on ER and HER2 expression subtypes. Investigation of the expression of multiple phosphorylated signaling proteins can be used for personalized targeted therapy. In invasive breast cancer, the overexpression of P38 MAPK may serve as a biomarker for the evaluation of P38 MAPK inhibitors.","['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases', 'Female', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",23900300,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.232.500', 'C04.557.470.615.132.500', 'C04.588.180.390', 'C17.800.090.500.390'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.249', 'D12.644.360.450.169', 'D12.776.476.450.169'], ['D05.500.117.875', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.429.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.625', 'D12.644.360.300.500', 'D12.776.476.081.875', 'D12.776.476.300.500'], ['D05.500.117.875.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.429.500.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.625.500', 'D12.644.360.300.500.500', 'D12.776.476.081.875.500', 'D12.776.476.300.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.565.100', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.200.100', 'D12.644.360.440.100', 'D12.776.476.440.100'], ['G02.111.820.560', 'G03.493.560', 'G04.835.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.755', 'D12.776.476.565', 'D12.776.624.664.700.168'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074.400', 'D12.776.624.664.700.642', 'D23.050.301.500.600.700', 'D23.050.705.552.600.550', 'D23.101.140.642'], ['D12.776.826.750.350', 'D12.776.930.778.350'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.862', 'D12.644.360.600', 'D12.776.476.600'], ['C04.588.180.788', 'C17.800.090.500.788'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.843', 'D12.644.360.450.835', 'D12.776.476.450.835']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
28629,Use of Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound for Diagnosis of Brain Death in Patients with Severe Cerebral Injury.,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the use of transcranial Doppler (TCD) for diagnosis of brain death in patients with severe cerebral injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study enrolled 42 patients based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients were divided into either the brain death group or the survival group according to prognosis. Blood flow of the brain was examined by TCD and analyzed for spectrum changes. The average blood flow velocity (Vm), pulse index (PI), and diastolic blood flow in reverse (RDF) were recorded and compared. RESULTS The data demonstrated that the average speed of bilateral middle cerebral artery blood flow in the brain death group was significantly reduced (P<0.05). However, the PI of the brain death group increased significantly. Moreover, RDF spectrum and nail-like sharp peak spectrum of the brain death group was higher than in the survival group. CONCLUSIONS Due to its simplicity, high repeatability, and specificity, TCD combined with other methods is highly valuable for diagnosis of brain death in patients with severe brain injury.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Brain', 'Brain Death', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Middle Cerebral Artery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial']",27264088,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.370.130', 'G09.330.380.630.080'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C10.228.140.151', 'C10.597.606.358.800.200.100', 'C23.550.260.159'], ['C10.228.140.199', 'C10.900.300.087', 'C26.915.300.200'], ['G09.330.100.159'], ['M01.060.406'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A07.015.114.228.550'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.370.350.578.937.260.850', 'E01.370.350.700.560.260.850', 'E01.370.350.850.260.850', 'E01.370.350.850.850.870', 'E01.370.376.537.750.260.850', 'E05.629.937.260.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40220,miR-200a/miR-141 and miR-205 upregulation might be associated with hormone receptor status and prognosis in endometrial carcinomas.,"The aim of this study was to compare the clinicopathological significance of miR-200a/miR-141 and miR-205 expression in endometrioid carcinomas (ECs) versus nonendometrioid carcinomas (NECs) and to assess their correlation with hormone receptor status. miR-200a/miR-141 and miR-205 expression in 154 endometrial cancers was determined by qRT-PCR. The status of estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR) was assessed using immunohistochemistry. miR-200a/miR-141 and miR-205 increased significantly in ECs and in NECs. The expression level of miR-200a was significantly higher in NECs than in ECs (P=0.025). Furthermore, there was a trend that NECs with worse clinicopathological variables had a higher miR-200a expression, while an inverse trend existed in ECs. miR-205 upregulation occurred frequently in NECs without lymph node metastases (P=0.030), whereas such association was not present in ECs. Interestingly, In ECs, miR-200a/miR-141 upregulation occurred frequently in the hormone receptor positive subgroups than the negative subgroups (P<0.05). Similarly, the expression level of miR-205 was higher in the hormone receptor positive subgroups and the association between miR-205 and PR reached statistical significance (P=0.024). In contrast, in NECs, a negative correlation was found between miR-200a/miR-141 and ER or PR status. Meanwhile, in ECs, miR-200a upregulation correlated with prolonged survival in the ER positive subgroup (P=0.046), whereas an inverse trend existed in the ER negative subgroup. Our findings suggest that miR-200a/miR-141 and miR-205 increased significantly in ECs and in NECs. However, they might behave differently in ECs versus NECs. miR-200a/miR-141 and miR-205 might be associated with hormone receptor status in endometrial cancer and may possess prognostic impacts.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma', 'Endometrial Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'MicroRNAs', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Receptors, Progesterone', 'Up-Regulation']",26045795,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.470.200'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.585', 'C13.351.500.852.762.200', 'C13.351.937.418.875.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['D13.150.650.319', 'D13.444.735.150.319', 'D13.444.735.790.552.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E05.393.620.500.706'], ['D12.776.826.750.350', 'D12.776.930.778.350'], ['D12.776.826.750.765'], ['G02.111.905', 'G05.308.850', 'G07.690.773.998']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
17877,Trans-abdominal ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlation for conformal intracavitary brachytherapy in carcinoma of the uterine cervix.,"PURPOSE: Trans-abdominal ultrasonography (US) is capable of determining size, shape, thickness, and diameter of uterus, cervix and disease at cervix or parametria. To assess the potential value of US for image-guided cervical cancer brachytherapy, we compared US-findings relevant for brachytherapy to the corresponding findings obtained from MR imaging.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with biopsy proven cervical cancer undergoing definitive radiotherapy with/without concomitant Cisplatin chemotherapy and suitable for brachytherapy were invited to participate in this study. US and MR were performed in a similar reproducible patient positioning after intracavitary application. US mid-sagittal and axial image at the level of external cervical os was acquired. Reference points D1 to D9 and distances were identified with respect to central tandem and flange, to delineate cervix, central disease, and external surface of the uterus.RESULTS: Thirty-two applications using CT/MR compatible applicators were evaluable. The D1 and D3 reference distances which represent anterior surface had a strong correlation with R=0.92 and 0.94 (p<0.01). The D2 and D4 reference distances in contrast, which represent the posterior surface had a moderate (D2) and a strong (D4) correlation with R=0.63 and 0.82 (p<0.01). Of all, D2 reference distance showed the least correlation of MR and US. The D5 reference distance representing the fundal thickness from tandem tip had a correlation of 0.98. The reference distances for D6, D7, D8, and D9 had a correlation of 0.94, 0.82, 0.96, and 0.93, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our study evaluating the use of US, suggests a reasonably strong correlation with MR in delineating uterus, cervix, and central disease for 3D conformal intracavitary brachytherapy planning.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Brachytherapy', 'Cisplatin', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Patient Positioning', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms']",21885140,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['E02.815.150'], ['D01.210.375', 'D01.625.125', 'D01.710.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E04.502.515'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E02.760.670', 'N02.421.585.700'], ['E02.815.639'], ['E02.950.825', 'L01.313.500.750.100.710.600.608'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['E01.370.350.850.855', 'E04.502.890'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.850', 'C13.351.500.852.593.131', 'C13.351.500.852.762.850', 'C13.351.937.418.875.850']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Seventy-eight tuberculosis/HIV positive and 2950 tuberculosis patients without HIV between 1985 and 1992 have been analyzed. The data have been collected directly from the files kept at Hemocentro and Instituto de Saude do Distrito Federal, Brasilia-DF Brazil. Statistical analysis using the X-squared and Kolmogorov Smirnov's tests have been applied. It has been observed a significant increase in the cases of pulmonary cavity and not cavity moderate tuberculosis among the tuberculosis/HIV positive patients when compared with the ones only infected with tuberculosis. In the age group below 40 years old, the male presented a higher incidence of cases when compared with the ones without HIV. In the age group below 34 years old, women showed a significative increase of the disease, when compared to men in the same age group.","['AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Surveillance', 'Sex Distribution', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tuberculosis']",9052241,"[['C01.221.250.875.100', 'C01.597.050', 'C01.610.684.050', 'C01.925.597.050', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.100', 'C20.673.480.100'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['Z01.107.757.176'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['I01.240.800', 'N01.224.803', 'N06.850.505.400.850'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

Vibratory acoustic stimulation was provided by an artificial larynx generating a signal at 85 dB and 85 Hz. This stimulus was applied for 5 seconds on the maternal abdomen over the fetal head after a 20-minute period of decreased fetal heart rate variability. All fetuses reacted with an immediate fetal heart rate acceleration of at least 10 bpm (range: 10 to 35 bpm, mean +/- SD = 18.4 +/- 7.0), and 19 fetuses also had sudden fetal body movement. A deceleration of the fetal heart rate after the initial acceleration was observed in nine fetuses (range: 15 to 70 bpm, mean +/- SD = 45.5 +/- 16.5).

29797,Improvement of a low pH antigen-antibody dissociation procedure for ELISA measurement of circulating anti-Abeta antibodies.,"BACKGROUND: Prior work from our group found that acid dissociation (pH 2.5 incubation) of serum from APP transgenic mice vaccinated against Abeta increased the apparent anti-Abeta titers, suggesting antibody masking by antigen in the ELISA assay. Subsequently, we found that pH 2.5 incubation of serum from unvaccinated non-transgenic mice showed antibody binding to Abeta1-42, but no increase when other proteins, including shorter Abeta peptides, coated the ELISA plate. To investigate further the effects of low pH incubation on apparent anti-Abeta1-42 signals, we examined normal sera from nonTg unvaccinated mice, nonTg mice vaccinated with Abeta peptide (to produce authentic anti-Abeta antibodies) or a monoclonal antibody against Abeta (6E10) using competitive-inhibition ELISA and Abeta epitope mapping assays. In addition, we examined use of a less stringent low pH procedure at pH 3.5, to ascertain if it had the same effects as the pH 2.5 procedure.RESULTS: We believe there are three distinct effects of pH 2.5 incubation.; A) an artifactual increase in binding to full length Abeta by mouse immunoglobulin which has low affinity for Abeta, B) an inactivation of anti-Abeta antibodies that is time dependent and C) unmasking of high affinity anti-Abeta antibodies when high levels of circulating Abeta is present in APP transgenic mice. All three reactions can interact to produce the final ELISA signal. Incubation of sera from unvaccinated nonTg mice at pH 2.5 enhanced ELISA signals by process A. Conversely, pH 2.5 incubation of sera from vaccinated nonTg mice with caused a time dependent reduction of antibody signal by process B (overcoming the increase caused by A). The artifactual anti-Abeta ELISA signal enhanced by pH 2.5 incubation of normal mouse sera could not be effectively competed by low to moderate concentrations of Abeta, nor bind to shorter Abeta peptides in a manner similar to authentic anti-Abeta antibodies. Incubation of mouse sera at pH 3.5 caused neither an apparent increase in anti-Abeta ELISA signal, nor an inactivation of the ELISA signals resulting from either vaccination or monoclonal antibodies. However, incubation at pH 3.5 was able to completely reverse the reduction in ELISA signal caused by Abeta complexing with antibodies in sera from vaccinated mice or monoclonal anti-Abeta antibodies.CONCLUSION: Incubation at pH 3.5 is sufficient to dissociate Abeta bound to anti-Abeta antibodies without producing artifactual increases in the signal, or inactivating authentic antibody binding. Thus, use of pH 3.5 is a considerable improvement over pH 2.5 incubation for unmasking anti-Abeta antibodies in ELISA assays to measure antibodies in APP transgenic mouse sera.","['Amyloid beta-Peptides', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Autoantibodies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",17374155,"[['D12.644.024', 'D12.776.049.407.249.500', 'D12.776.543.039.500'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.257', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.257', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.257', 'D23.050.101'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.323', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.323', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.323'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['G02.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['D12.644.541'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Scores were analysed in relation to at-school expectations of obtaining employment and expressed importance of getting a job. In both employed and unemployed groups, low prior expectations of getting a job led to a greater increase in self-esteem than high prior expectations. Among the unemployed, those who had rated getting a job as relatively important showed a greater increase in depressive affect than those who had rated getting a job as relatively less important.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aspirations, Psychological', 'Depression', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Male', 'Motivation', 'Self Concept', 'Set, Psychology', 'Unemployment']",7984731,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F01.658.100', 'F02.784.629.155'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['N01.824.245'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.784.692.425'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['F01.752.747.792'], ['F02.463.425.838'], ['N01.824.245.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
7793,Identification of an acute myeloid leukaemia associated noncoding somatic mutation at 3' end of HOXA cluster.,"Noncoding somatic mutations have been demonstrated to play important role in tumourigenesis. Here we show that there exists an acute myeloid leukaemia associated noncoding somatic mutation at 3' terminal of conserved HOXA cluster. The mutation was identified in the bone marrow blasts but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells or buccal cells of two M3 (acute promyelocytic leukaemia, APL) type patients from 45 acute myeloid leukaemia patients. The mutation also existed in a pair of twins one of them developed acute myeloid leukaemia M4 (acute myelomonocytic leukaemia) type. The mutation resides in about 2-kb downstream of HOXA1 gene where a functional retinoic acid response element is located and also bound by histone demethylase KDM3B. Reporter assay showed that the mutation results in the upregulation of transcriptional activity and unresponsiveness to retinoic acid receptor. To sum up, we identified a new acute myeloid leukaemia associated noncoding somatic mutation.","[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Alleles', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",31204714,"[['D13.444.735.544.875.880', 'D13.444.735.790.878.880', 'G05.360.340.024.220.880.880', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.910.880'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['E05.393.385'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['G05.380'], ['D12.776.260.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.682.662.582.475.500', 'D08.811.682.690.416.388'], ['C04.557.337.539.275'], ['C04.557.337.539.275.700'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G05.365.795.598']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
46288,Intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels modulate human placental trophoblast syncytialization.,"Regulation of human placental syncytiotrophoblast renewal by cytotrophoblast migration, aggregation/fusion and differentiation is essential for successful pregnancy. In several tissues, these events are regulated by intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (IKCa), in part through their ability to regulate cell volume. We used cytotrophoblasts in primary culture to test the hypotheses that IKCa participate in the formation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast and in syncytiotrophoblast volume homeostasis. Cytotrophoblasts were isolated from normal term placentas and cultured for 66 h. This preparation recreates syncytiotrophoblast formation in vivo, as mononucleate cells (15 h) fuse into multinucleate syncytia (66 h) concomitant with elevated secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Cells were treated with the IKCa inhibitor TRAM-34 (10 µM) or activator DCEBIO (100 µM). Culture medium was collected to measure hCG secretion and cells fixed for immunofluorescence with anti-IKCa and anti-desmoplakin antibodies to assess IKCa expression and multinucleation respectively. K+ channel activity was assessed by measuring 86Rb efflux at 66 h. IKCa immunostaining was evident in nucleus, cytoplasm and surface of mono- and multinucleate cells. DCEBIO increased 86Rb efflux 8.3-fold above control and this was inhibited by TRAM-34 (85%; p<0.0001). Cytotrophoblast multinucleation increased 12-fold (p<0.05) and hCG secretion 20-fold (p<0.05), between 15 and 66 h. Compared to controls, DCEBIO reduced multinucleation by 42% (p<0.05) and hCG secretion by 80% (p<0.05). TRAM-34 alone did not affect cytotrophoblast multinucleation or hCG secretion. Hyposmotic solution increased 86Rb efflux 3.8-fold (p<0.0001). This effect was dependent on extracellular Ca2+, inhibited by TRAM-34 and 100 nM charybdotoxin (85% (p<0.0001) and 43% respectively) but unaffected by 100 nM apamin. In conclusion, IKCa are expressed in cytotrophoblasts and their activation inhibits the formation of multinucleated cells in vitro. IKCa are stimulated by syncytiotrophoblast swelling implicating a role in syncytiotrophoblast volume homeostasis. Inappropriate activation of IKCa in pathophysiological conditions could compromise syncytiotrophoblast turnover and volume homeostasis in pregnancy disease.","['Analysis of Variance', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Fusion', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Placenta', 'Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated', 'Pregnancy', 'Pyrazoles', 'Rubidium Radioisotopes', 'Trophoblasts']",24595308,"[['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['D03.633.100.103'], ['G03.143'], ['E01.370.225.500.223', 'E05.200.500.265', 'E05.242.223', 'E05.481.500.249'], ['E05.242.307', 'G04.155'], ['D06.472.699.322.326', 'D06.472.699.649.367', 'D12.644.548.726.367', 'D12.776.780.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512.240', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512.240', 'E05.200.500.607.512.240', 'E05.200.750.551.512.240', 'E05.478.583.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['A16.710'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.600.150', 'D12.776.543.550.450.750.150', 'D12.776.543.585.400.750.150'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['D03.383.129.539'], ['D01.496.749.740'], ['A11.382.992', 'A16.254.500.766', 'A16.710.802']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
34497,Predictive factors for metastatic infection in patients with bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis and psoas abscess are serious complications of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia because failure to identify these infections may result in bacteremia relapse or poor prognosis. In the present study, we determined the predictive factors for metastatic infection due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus bacteremia.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus bacteremia at the Jikei University Hospital between January 2008 and December 2012. Factors analyzed included the underlying disease, initial antimicrobial treatment and primary site of infection.RESULTS: During the 5-year study period, 73 patients met the inclusion criteria and were assessed. The most common primary site of bacteremia was catheter-related bloodstream infection (25/73 [34.2%]). Metastatic infection occurred in 14 of 73 patients (19.2%) (infective endocarditis [3], septic pulmonary abscess [3], spondylitis [4], psoas abscess [4], epidural abscess [3] and septic arthritis [1]). Six patients had multiple metastatic infections. Multivariate analysis revealed that the predictive factors associated with the development of metastatic infection were a delay in appropriate antimicrobial treatment of >48 hours, persistent fever for >72 hours after starting antibiotic treatment and lowest C-reactive protein levels of >3 mg/dL during 2 weeks after the onset of bacteremia.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that additional diagnostic tests should be conducted to identify metastatic infection, particularly in patients with delayed antimicrobial treatment, persistent fever and persistently high C-reactive protein levels.","['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'C-Reactive Protein', 'Catheter-Related Infections', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Methicillin', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Staphylococcal Infections', 'Staphylococcus aureus']",25250988,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['C01.150.252.100', 'C01.757.100', 'C23.550.470.790.500.100'], ['D12.776.034.145', 'D12.776.124.050.120', 'D12.776.124.486.157'], ['C01.195'], ['C23.888.119.344'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['D02.065.589.099.750.500', 'D02.886.108.750.500', 'D03.633.100.300.750.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C01.150.252.410.868'], ['B03.300.390.400.800.750.100', 'B03.353.500.750.750.100', 'B03.510.100.750.750.100', 'B03.510.400.790.750.100']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
39906,In vitro dual perfusion of human placental lobules as a flow phantom to investigate the relationship between fetoplacental flow and quantitative 3D power doppler angiography.,"Flow phantoms have been used to investigate and quantify three-dimensional power Doppler data but this is the first study to use the in vitro, dual perfused, placental perfusion model. We used this model to investigate and quantify the effect of variation in fetal-side flow rates and attenuation on 3D power Doppler angiography. Perfusion of a placental lobule was commenced within 30 min of delivery and experimentation was successful in 8 of the 18 placenta obtained. Fetal and maternal perfusate was modified Earle's bicarbonate buffer which, following equilibration, was supplemented on the fetal side with whole heparinised cord blood. Imaging was performed with a Voluson-i ultrasound machine. A 'vascular biopsy' the thickness of the placental lobule was defined and signal quantified within using VOCAL (GE Medical Systems, Zipf, Austria). Three vascular indices are generated: vascularisation index (VI) defined as the percentage of power Doppler data within a volume of interest; flow index (FI), the mean signal intensity of the power Doppler information; and vascularisation flow index (VFI), a combination of both factors derived through their multiplication. Attenuation was investigated in this model with the addition of tissue mimic blocks. Our results showed a predictable relationship between flow rates and the vascular indices VI and VFI. However the FI was a less reliable predictor of flow; thus it should be interpreted with caution. The power Doppler signal was markedly affected by attenuation leading to a complete loss of information at a depth of 6 cm in the model used. In conclusion this model can be adapted to provide a phantom to analyse and quantify 3D power Doppler signals and demonstrates that vascular indices within a tissue remain related to volume flow. This model provides further evidence that depth dependent attenuation of signal needs to be accounted for in any in vivo work where the probe is not in direct contact with the tissue of interest.","['Adult', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Perfusion', 'Placental Circulation', 'Pregnancy', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler', 'Young Adult']",19059643,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A16.378'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.158.600', 'E01.370.350.350', 'L01.313.500.750.100.158.600'], ['G08.686.784.769.455'], ['E05.481.500.484'], ['E05.680'], ['G09.330.100.749'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['G09.330.100.780'], ['E01.370.350.850.850'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

40812,Diagnostic performances of [18F]fluorocholine positron emission tomography in brain tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Brain tumors characterization by molecular imaging that allows the depiction of brain lesions metabolic pattern is crucial. Our study aimed to: 1) to evaluate the diagnostic performances of [18F]fluoroethylcholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([18F]FECH PET/CT), and 2) correlate PET imaging derived parameters of [18F]FECH to survival in brain tumors.METHODS: From 2009 to 2012, we enrolled 30 patients who underwent [18F]FECH PET/CT. Final diagnosis was established by clinical and radiological follow-up.RESULTS: Final diagnosis was consistent with tumor disease in 27/30 cases. In 3/30 cases tumor disease was ruled out. [18F]FECH PET/CT resulted true positive and negative in 21/30 and 9/30 patients, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of [18F]FECH PET/CT were 78%, 100%, 100%, 33%, and 80%, respectively. Mean and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmean and SUVmax) resulted statistically correlated to histology (P=0.0255 and P=0.0222, respectively). Using a SUVmax cut-off of 2.0 or 3.2, we distinguished between low- and high-grade gliomas with a good specificity (70% and 80%, respectively).

23306,The outcome of chronic dialysis in infants and toddlers--advantages and drawbacks of haemodialysis.,"BACKGROUND: Improvements in dialysis technology allow replacement therapy for even the youngest of children with end stage renal disease. Nevertheless, the cumulative experience in this age group is limited.METHODS: We compared the outcome of 20 children who initiated chronic dialysis before the age of 1 year (weight 4.9 +/- 2 kg, Group 1), with a particular focus on those under the age of 1 month (eight children, weight 2.9 +/- 0.34), to that of 14 patients, aged 1.1-3 years when starting dialysis (weight 10.1 +/- 1.7, Group 2).RESULTS: The outcome was poor in the youngest age group; only 3/8 survived to 3 years. Of those who started dialysis between the ages of 0.3 and 3 years, 84% underwent kidney transplantation. One-, three-, five-, and eight-year patient survival was 96%, 88%, 84% and 84% respectively [corrected] Severe co-morbidities were present in almost half of those who died. Hospital stay was 3.5 times longer in Group 1 than in Group 2 during the first 3 months of dialysis. Permanent central venous catheters inserted under ultrasound guidance resulted in a 4.4-fold increase in catheter survival compared to non-cuffed catheters. Marked blood loss at beginning of haemodialysis (HD) is attributable to residual volume in the dialysis system (15.7 mL/kg/month) and frequent blood tests (12.1 +/- 5.9 mL/kg/month). These values decreased 2-fold after 8 months of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The main factors determining the poor outcome of infants on dialysis are extremely young age at initiation and severe co-morbidities. Despite some disadvantages, HD may be successfully implemented in infants and toddlers, in highly specialized centres with a well-trained nursing staff.","['Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Renal Dialysis']",18065806,"[['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['C12.777.419.780.750.500', 'C13.351.968.419.780.750.500'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['E02.870.300', 'E02.912.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
13030,Activities of sordarins in murine histoplasmosis.,Sordarins are new antifungals which inhibit fungal protein synthesis by blocking elongation factor 2. Three compounds were evaluated in a murine model of histoplasmosis. Immune-competent mice were infected intravenously with 10(6) to 10(8) CFU of Histoplasma capsulatum yeast cells. Mice were treated either orally with sordarins or fluconazole from day 2 through 8 after infection or intraperitoneally with amphotericin B during the same period. Protection was measured by increased rates of survival for 30 days after infection or reduction of lung or kidney tissue counts 9 days after infection. All three of the antifungal drugs tested were protective compared with controls. Sordarins were effective at doses as low as 2 mg/kg of body weight/day.

24552,Investigation of an acoustic-mechanical method to detect implant loosening.,"Precise diagnosis of loosening of endoprosthetic implants plays an important role in timely, adequate treatment. However, today's diagnostic tools, mainly radiological evaluation, do not yield satisfactory results. Therefore, a new approach based on the transmission of an internally generated combined acoustic and vibration signal, was investigated. For signal generation, a magnetic oscillator which impinges inside an implant component, can be used. The signal can be detected by an external accelerometer being positioned on the skin surface. Differences in the signal generated result from varying degrees of implant fixation. This principle was tested in seven porcine foreleg specimens with a custom implant. Influence of the measurement location at the porcine skin and different levels of fixation were investigated (pressfit, slight loosening, advanced loosening), with regard to the pull-out strength. Evaluation of different parameters, especially the frequency spectrum resulted in differences of up to 12% for the comparison between pressfit and slight loosening, and 30% between pressfit and advanced loosening. A significant correlation between the measured frequency and the pull-out strength for different levels of fixation was found. Thus, the novel diagnostic method shows potential for the precise detection of implant loosening. Further work is required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed system in animal experiments.","['Acoustics', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Mechanical Phenomena', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Vibration']",23860369,"[['H01.671.031'], ['E05.325.192'], ['G01.374'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['G01.374.930']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
1868,Interatrial shunt flow profiles in newborn infants: a colour flow and pulsed Doppler echocardiographic study.,"Interatrial shunt flow profiles in 36 normal term infants were examined serially by colour flow and pulsed Doppler echocardiographic techniques from within an hour of birth to four or five days after birth. Shunt flow across the foramen ovale was detected in 33 normal infants (92%) within an hour of birth (mean 40 minutes). The occurrence of interatrial shunting decreased with age, but a shunt signal was still detected in 17 infants (47%) on the fourth or fifth day of life, by then the ductus arteriosus had already closed in all the normal infants. The direction of interatrial shunt flow was predominantly left-to-right, but in 64% there was a coexistent small right-to-left shunt in diastole within an hour of birth; by four to five days it was found in 19%. In the six patients with persistent fetal circulation the direction of the interatrial shunt flow was predominantly right-to-left with biphasic peaks in diastole and systole at the early stage of the disease, and the period of right-to-left shunt flow during each cardiac cycle was significantly longer than that in normal infants examined within 1 hour of birth. In all patients the ductus closed before the foramen ovale. At the time of ductal closure in all patients with persistent fetal circulation right-to-left shunt flow was seen during diastole and its period was still prolonged. These findings suggest that interatrial shunting, predominantly left-to-right, is common in normal newborn infants. Evaluation of the characteristics of the interatrial shunt by Doppler echocardiography may be useful for predicting the progress of or improvement in neonates with persistent fetal circulation.","['Blood Flow Velocity', 'Ductus Arteriosus', 'Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Heart Atria', 'Heart Septum', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Persistent Fetal Circulation Syndrome', 'Time Factors']",1993129,"[['E01.370.370.130', 'G09.330.380.630.080'], ['A07.541.278.395', 'A16.378.303.395'], ['E01.370.350.130.750.220', 'E01.370.350.850.220.220', 'E01.370.350.850.850.220', 'E01.370.370.380.220.220'], ['A07.541.358'], ['A07.541.459'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['C08.381.423.694', 'C16.614.694'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
1601,[Clusterin is a potential serum marker of hepatic carcinoma].,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the differentially expressed serum proteins in patients with hepatoma carcinoma and identify a putative diagnostic marker.METHOD: The isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling method and LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF MS detection method were used to quantify serum proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma patients (n =20) and healthy individuals (n =20). Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to verify the differentially expressed proteins by analyzing the corresponding mRNA expression levels in the hepatic carcinoma and healthy hepatocyte samples, as well as in 30 pairs of patient-matched hepatic carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue samples. Western blot analysis was used to verify the protein expression in hepatic carcinoma cells.RESULT: Fifty-one proteins were significantly differentially expressed between the hepatic carcinoma group and healthy controls. The iTRAQ protein profile showed that the serum level of clusterin was significantly lower in hepatoma carcinoma patients. The mRNA level of clusterin was 20-fold lower in hepatic carcinoma cells than in healthy hepatocytes, and was 2.38-fold lower in hepatoma tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues. The clusterin protein levels were significantly lower in hepatic carcinoma cells (8.06 vs normal hepatocytes: 27.81; P less than 0.01).CONCLUSION: The serum expression of clusterin is significantly decreased in both serum and tissues of hepatic carcinoma patients.

38881,On-line continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration: a technique for the control of ultrafiltration and convection during continuous renal replacement therapy.,"Continuous renal replacement therapies have been used increasingly in critically ill patients in nephrologic and intensive care units. These techniques are nevertheless time consuming and lack an easy control of ultrafiltration. We conducted continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) on a dialysate delivery machine which ensures a volumetric control of ultrafiltration, and which produces both dialysate and infusate with the on-line technique. This new mode of CVVHD was firstly assessed in a feasibility study and was secondly used in a randomized prospective study whose goal was to establish the usefulness of convection. On-line continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (OL-CVVHDF) appeared safe and time saving, and allowed the fine control of fluid management in critically ill patients. Convective transfers were achieved by a 2 L/h predilutional infusion and increased urea and creatinine clearances twofold. OL-CVVHDF revealed itself to be a valuable method for the control of ultrafiltration and for efficient convective transfers during CVVHD.","['Acute Kidney Injury', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Creatinine', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Hemodiafiltration', 'Humans', 'Prospective Studies', 'Ultrafiltration']",7899582,"[['C12.777.419.780.050', 'C13.351.968.419.780.050'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['E02.870.300.200', 'E02.912.800.200', 'E04.292.471.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E04.292.975', 'E05.196.454.807', 'G01.280.807', 'G02.263.807']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
6393,The development of coordination via joint expectations for shared benefits.,"People frequently need to cooperate despite having strong self-serving motives. In the current study, pairs of 5- and 7-year-olds (N = 160) faced a one-shot coordination problem: To benefit, children had to choose the same of 3 reward divisions. They could not communicate or see each other and thus had to accurately predict each other's choices to succeed. One division split the rewards evenly, while the others each favored one child. Five-year-olds mostly chose the division favorable to themselves, resulting in coordination failure. By contrast, 7-year-olds mostly coordinated successfully by choosing the division that split the rewards equally (even though they behaved selfishly in a control condition in which they could choose independently). This suggests that by age 7, children jointly expect benefits to be shared among interdependent social partners ""fairly"" and that fair compromises can emanate from a cooperative rationality adapted for social coordination.

7979,NMR investigation of mithramycin A binding to d(ATGCAT)2: a comparative study with chromomycin A3.,"The binding of mithramycin A to the d(A1T2G3C4A5T6) duplex was investigated by 1H NMR and found to be similar to that of its analogue chromomycin A3. In the presence of Mg2+, mithramycin binds strongly to d(ATGCAT)2. On the basis of the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum, the complex formed possesses C2 symmetry at a stoichiometry of two drugs per duplex (2:1) and is in slow chemical exchange on the NMR time scale. NOESY experiments reveal contacts from the E-pyranose of mithramycin to the terminal and nonterminal adenine H2 proton of DNA and from the drug hydroxyl proton to both G3NH2 protons, C4H1' proton, and A5H1' proton. These data place the drug chromophore and E pyranose on the minor groove side of d(ATGCAT)2. NOE contacts from the A-, B-, C-, and D-pyranoses of mithramycin to several deoxyribose protons suggest that the A- and B-rings are oriented along the sugar-phosphate backbone of G3-C4, while the C- and D-rings are located along the sugar-phosphate backbone of A5-T6. These drug-DNA contacts are very similar to those found for chromomycin binding to d(ATGCAT)2. Unlike chromomycin, the NOESY spectrum of mithramycin at the molar ratio of one drug per duplex reveals several chemical exchange cross-peaks corresponding to the drug-free and drug-bound proton resonances. From the intensity of these cross-peaks and the corresponding diagonal peaks, the off-rate constant was estimated to be 0.4 s-1. These data suggest that the exchange rate of mithramycin binding to d(ATGCAT)2 is faster than that of chromomycin.","['Base Sequence', 'Chromomycin A3', 'DNA', 'Hydrogen', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Plicamycin', 'Protein Conformation']",2148686,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D09.408.210.209'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D01.268.406', 'D01.362.340'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.650', 'D04.615.562.050.650', 'D09.408.051.059.650'], ['G02.111.570.820.709']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

MD in the frontal lobe and the course of disease (P < 0.05), FA in the right hippocampus and the social score of the self-consciousness scale (P < 0.01) had a positive correlation.CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to evaluate the relationship between emotion disorders and cognitive changes in the microstructure of the brain in children with haemophilia A, suggesting that DKI provides more information about tissue microstructural changes than do the conventional image method and traditional psychological tests.","['Adolescent', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Emotions', 'Hemophilia A', 'Humans', 'Male']",28205277,"[['M01.060.057'], ['A08.186.211'], ['F02.463.188'], ['F01.470'], ['C15.378.100.100.500', 'C15.378.100.141.500', 'C15.378.463.500', 'C16.320.099.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
12697,"Utilization for protein synthesis of 2-ketoisocaproate relative to utilization of leucine, as estimated from exhalation of labelled CO2.","1. We have previously shown that the ratio (RWBP) of incorporation of label from 2-ketoisocaproate (KIC) into the leucine of whole-body protein to the simultaneous incorporation of label from leucine itself into protein is a measure of the nutritional efficiency of KIC as a substitute for leucine. 2. In order to determine whether RWBP can be estimated indirectly from measurement of labelled CO2 excretion, rats were injected orally or intravenously with [4,5-3H]leucine and either [1-14C]leucine or [1-14C]KIC. Expired CO2 was collected for 6 h. 3. The results show that 9-14% of KIC underwent first-pass oxidation after oral administration. When isotopes were given intravenously, the mean rate of excretion of 14CO2 from KIC, after 20 min, remained 1.8 times the mean rate of excretion of 14CO2 from leucine. 4. Mean RWBP, measured in whole-body protein in rats given isotopes orally or intravenously along with small or large doses of carriers, was the same as mean RWBP estimated from mean cumulative CO2 excretion. 5. We conclude (1) that nutritional efficiency of KIC relative to leucine can be estimated from measurement of labelled CO2 excretion, and (2) that the relative inefficiency of KIC as a substitute for leucine in the rat is attributable to first-pass oxidation of 9-14% (when given orally) and 80% greater susceptibility to systemic oxidation than leucine.","['Animals', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Keto Acids', 'Leucine', 'Male', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",3138058,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['D02.241.755'], ['D12.125.070.637', 'D12.125.142.441'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['G02.111.660.871', 'G03.734.871', 'G05.297.670'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
31871,Linkage analysis between bipolar affective disorder and markers on chromosome X.,"Since 1969, several classical linkage studies suggested an X-chromosome locus for bipolar affective disorder. However, methods using highly polymorphic DNA markers have provided conflicting evidence for linkage, and an X-chromosomal locus for bipolar disorder remains controversial. More recently, Pekkarinen et al. (1995) found a maximum LOD score of 3.54 at the marker DXS994 in a large bipolar Finnish kindred. In the present study, we attempted to replicate this finding using 43 families multiply affected by bipolar affective disorder. These families were selected for the absence of male-to-male transmission of the disease, and were genotyped for two microsatellte markers, DXS1227 and DXS1062 (which is about 2 cM telomeric to DXS994). Linkage to this region was excluded either using a two-point lod score method with two plausible genetic models, or by a model-free lod score analysis which does not require specification of a particular mode of transmission. We conclude that there is no evidence of a common major gene for bipolar affective disorder at Xq25-q27 in our set of families.","['Bipolar Disorder', 'Brazil', 'England', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Lod Score', 'Male', 'Wales', 'X Chromosome']",9800220,"[['F03.084.500'], ['Z01.107.757.176'], ['Z01.542.363.300'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G05.348.750'], ['Z01.542.363.914'], ['A11.284.187.865.982', 'G05.360.162.865.982']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
34617,Transglomerular cationic macromolecular flux is mediated by a convection-binding mechanism.,"Glomerular polyanion function was explored using charged and neutral [3H]dextrans in the multiple indicator-dilution experiment. Anesthetized dogs received an intrarenal bolus of 125I-labeled albumin (plasma reference), [14C]inulin (glomerular reference) and [3H]dextran (test solute), followed by rapid serial sampling of the renal venous and urine outflows. Reduced urinary recovery of cationic diethylaminoethyl dextrans (DEAE) [3H]dextrans [19.0- to 31.5-A Stokes-Einstein radius (SER)], compared with neutral [3H]dextran indicated intrarenal binding reversed by excess unlabeled cationic dextran. Tubular microperfusion with cationic [3H]dextran confirmed a pretubular binding site (presumed glomerular). The application of a computer-assisted mathematical model of convective flux plus reversible binding revealed that binding affinity increased with molecular size. In vitro high-affinity binding of the same cationic [3H]dextrans to isolated rat glomeruli was also found to increase with molecular size and was inhibited by protamine sulfate. Intrarenal polycation perfusion with protamine sulfate (1.0-3.8 mg/g kidney) or lysozyme (1.1-2.2 mg/g body wt) resulted in intraglomerular binding of anionic [3H]dextran without increased proteinuria or altered glomerular permselectivity to neutral [3H]dextrans less than or equal to 33.0-A SER. Hence, transglomerular cationic solute flux is mediated by a convection-binding mechanism that creates an effective polyvalent barrier.","['Animals', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Cations', 'Dextrans', 'Dogs', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Indicator Dilution Techniques', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Male', 'Microinjections', 'Models, Biological', 'Protamines', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",2470261,"[['B01.050'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['D01.248.497.300'], ['D05.750.078.562.272', 'D09.698.365.272'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['E05.481'], ['E05.484'], ['A05.810.453.324.359', 'A05.810.453.736.520'], ['D05'], ['E02.319.267.530.690', 'E05.591.570'], ['E05.599.395'], ['D12.776.660.750', 'D12.776.664.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
17212,"SB-216763, a GSK-3â inhibitor, protects against aldosterone-induced cardiac, and renal injury by activating autophagy.","Cardiovascular and renal inflammation induced by Aldosterone (Aldo) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and renal fibrosis. GSK-3â contributes to inflammatory cardiovascular and renal diseases, but its role in Aldo-induced hypertension, and renal damage is not clear. In the present study, rats were treated with Aldo combined with SB-216763 (a GSK-3â inhibitor) for 4 weeks. Hemodynamic, cardiac, and renal parameters were assayed at the indicated time. Here we found that rats treated with Aldo presented cardiac and renal hypertrophy and dysfunction. Cardiac and renal expression levels of molecular markers attesting inflammation and fibrosis were increased by Aldo infusion, whereas the treatment of SB-216763 reversed these alterations. SB-216763 suppressed cardiac and renal inflammatory cytokines levels (TNF-a, IL-1â, and MCP-1). Meanwhile, SB-216763 increased the protein levels of LC3-II in the cardiorenal tissues as well as p62 degradation, indicating that SB-216763 induced autophagy activation in cardiac, and renal tissues. Importantly, inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA attenuated the role of SB-216763 in inhibiting perivascular fibrosis, and tubulointerstitial injury. These data suggest that SB-216763 protected against Aldo-induced cardiac and renal injury by activating autophagy, and might be a therapeutic option for salt-sensitive hypertension and renal fibrosis.","['Aldosterone', 'Animals', 'Autophagy', 'Cytokines', 'Fibrosis', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Heart Diseases', 'Indoles', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Male', 'Maleimides', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",29600538,"[['D04.210.500.745.745.654.062', 'D06.472.040.585.353.118'], ['B01.050'], ['G04.011'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['C23.550.355'], ['D05.500.117.875.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.429.500.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.625.500', 'D12.644.360.300.500.500', 'D12.776.476.081.875.500', 'D12.776.476.300.500.500'], ['C14.280'], ['D03.633.100.473'], ['C23.550.470'], ['C12.777.419', 'C13.351.968.419'], ['D02.241.081.337.502.524', 'D02.478.440', 'D03.383.129.578.399'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
32542,Induction of alkylator (melphalan) resistance in HL60 cells is accompanied by increased levels of topoisomerase II expression and function.,"Human leukemic HL60 cells were selected for resistance to alkylating agents by stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of L-phenylalanine mustard (melphalan). The resulting resistant cell line (R-HL60) was 4-fold resistant (melphalan IC50 value, 27.84 +/- 4.2 microM) to melphalan compared with parental HL60 cells (melphalan IC50 value, 6.9 +/- 1.78 microM). Nuclear extracts from R-HL60 cells possess a approximately 4-fold increase in DNA topoisomerase II activity compared with parental HL60 cells. As determined using Western blot analysis, the level of topoisomerase IIalpha protein expressed in R-HL60 cells was approximately 3-fold that of parental HL60 cells. However, there were no differences observed in the level of topoisomerase IIbeta protein, in the topoisomerase I activity, or in the level of topoisomerase I protein expression comparing the two cell lines. R-HL60 cells were 5-fold more sensitive than parental HL60 cells to the cytotoxic effect of the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin. The sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin did not differ in R-HL60 and parental HL60 cell lines. Preincubation with doxorubicin significantly increased melphalan-induced interstrand DNA cross-link formation and cytotoxicity in R-HL60 cells compared with the parental HL60 cells. The affinity of topoisomerase II for UV-irradiated cross-linked HL60 DNA was increased by approximately 2.5-fold compared with that of HL60 native DNA. The affinity of topoisomerase II for both UV-irradiated (cross-linked) and native DNA was significantly decreased after doxorubicin pretreatment. Elevated topoisomerase II activity and the increased affinity of topoisomerase II for cross-linked DNA in melphalan-resistant cells seems to contribute to alkylator resistance by changing DNA topology, thereby facilitating DNA repair.","['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Doxorubicin', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Melphalan', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",10385695,"[['D27.505.519.124.035', 'D27.505.954.248.150', 'D27.888.569.035.035'], ['D27.720.470.410.210'], ['D13.444.308.135', 'G05.200.104'], ['G05.200'], ['D08.811.399.403.483', 'D12.776.157.687.375', 'D12.776.660.720.375'], ['D08.811.399.403.741'], ['D13.444.308.425'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['G05.297'], ['A11.251.210.190.465', 'A11.251.860.180.465', 'A11.627.340.360.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D02.455.526.728.650.594', 'D12.125.072.050.685.500'], ['D27.505.519.389.892.750', 'D27.505.954.248.794.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
46961,Epigenomic Reprogramming of Adult Cardiomyocyte-Derived Cardiac Progenitor Cells.,"It has been believed that mammalian adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) are terminally-differentiated and are unable to proliferate. Recently, using a bi-transgenic ACM fate mapping mouse model and an in vitro culture system, we demonstrated that adult mouse cardiomyocytes were able to dedifferentiate into cardiac progenitor-like cells (CPCs). However, little is known about the molecular basis of their intrinsic cellular plasticity. Here we integrate single-cell transcriptome and whole-genome DNA methylation analyses to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the dedifferentiation and cell cycle reentry of mouse ACMs. Compared to parental cardiomyocytes, dedifferentiated mouse cardiomyocyte-derived CPCs (mCPCs) display epigenomic reprogramming with many differentially-methylated regions, both hypermethylated and hypomethylated, across the entire genome. Correlated well with the methylome, our transcriptomic data showed that the genes encoding cardiac structure and function proteins are remarkably down-regulated in mCPCs, while those for cell cycle, proliferation, and stemness are significantly up-regulated. In addition, implantation of mCPCs into infarcted mouse myocardium improves cardiac function with augmented left ventricular ejection fraction. Our study demonstrates that the cellular plasticity of mammalian cardiomyocytes is the result of a well-orchestrated epigenomic reprogramming and a subsequent global transcriptomic alteration.","['Animals', 'Cell Dedifferentiation', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'Cellular Reprogramming Techniques', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myoblasts, Cardiac', 'Myocardium', 'Myocytes, Cardiac', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transcriptome']",26657817,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.148'], ['G04.152.262', 'G05.135'], ['E05.200.500.380', 'E05.242.378', 'E05.393.085'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['G02.111.035.538.161', 'G02.111.218', 'G03.059.538.161', 'G05.206'], ['G05.308.203'], ['H01.158.273.180.350.074', 'H01.158.273.343.350.042'], ['E05.393.332'], ['A11.872.040.500', 'A11.872.700.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['A07.541.704.500', 'A10.690.552.750.500', 'A11.872.620.470'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['A07.541.704.570', 'A10.690.552.750.570', 'A11.620.500'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.242.900'], ['E02.095.147.500.500', 'E04.936.225.687'], ['G02.111.873.750', 'G05.297.700.750', 'G05.360.920']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
17316,Successful prophylaxis for fungal peritonitis in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: six years' experience.,"Fungal peritonitis as a serious complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is often associated with severe morbidity, CAPD ""drop-out"" and, occasionally, death. Most episodes of fungal peritonitis occur during or after a period of antibiotic treatment of various bacterial infections, usually bacterial peritonitis. From April 1979 to December 1982 (period I), 10 episodes of fungal peritonitis occurred during 415 patient-months, ie, 10.5% of all peritonitis episodes recorded in our CAPD program. After the introduction of oral prophylaxis with 3 x 500,000 IU [corrected] nystatin during every course of antibiotic treatment, only four episodes of fungal peritonitis occurred during 2,102 patient-months, ie, 3.1% of all peritonitis episodes from January 1983 to March 1989 (period II). This difference between the first and second periods is significant (P less than 0.05). Moreover, none of the four patients who contracted fungal peritonitis in the second period received nystatin prophylaxis. Thus, the simple measure of oral prophylaxis using this nonabsorbable antifungal agent in every case of an antibiotic treatment largely eliminates the risk of fungal peritonitis in patients on CAPD.","['Administration, Oral', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Candidiasis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nystatin', 'Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory', 'Peritonitis']",1986569,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['C01.150.252'], ['C01.150.703.160'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.540.505.575'], ['E02.760.106.500', 'E02.870.300.650.500', 'E02.912.800.650.500', 'N02.421.585.106.500'], ['C01.463.600', 'C06.844.640']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
47938,[ERRORS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF IMMUNODEPENDENT PATHOLOGY (ORIGINAL CONCEPT)].,"Based on many years of experience in 2009, we developed the original concept of a mixed approach to the treatment of infectious diseases in patients. During 2.5 years(from 2013 to June 2015) to have applied for consultative-diagnostic help of 3965 patients who had not verified the primary diagnosis. The basic principle of verification of the pathology of the removal of various causes immunosuppression. Based on our extensive, research and observation was often found in patients ascaridosis (55%) and giardiasis (65%), as a possible cause of immunosuppression. In 13% of patients was found the mucosal candidiasis. Among frequently and chronically ill persons we identified the active forms of Epstein-Barr virus (quantitative polymerase chain reaction in saliva) in 40%. The criterion for assessing performance immunogram was a decrease of two sigmal deviation from the lower age limit. In the study of neutrophil myeloperoxidase content observed decline (< 60%) in 99 (9.7%) of 1015 patients, indicating a fairly common cause of long-term permit infection in the tissues and persistence C. albicans. In the study of lymphocyte subpopulations often demonstrated reduction in the number of natural killer cells (26.7% of subjects), which shows a decline of one of the most important factors of congenital immunity. Among the humoral immune disorders often noted the decrease of total IgG (2.4%) and its subclass IgG1 (22.1%), indicating a significant diagnostic value determination of IgG subclasses it even with normal serum total.

9506,A retrograde apoptotic signal originating in NGF-deprived distal axons of rat sympathetic neurons in compartmented cultures.,"Previous investigations of retrograde survival signaling by nerve growth factor (NGF) and other neurotrophins have supported diverse mechanisms, but all proposed mechanisms have in common the generation of survival signals retrogradely transmitted to the neuronal cell bodies. We report the finding of a retrograde apoptotic signal in axons that is suppressed by local NGF signaling. NGF withdrawal from distal axons alone was sufficient to activate the pro-apoptotic transcription factor, c-jun, in the cell bodies. Providing NGF directly to cell bodies, thereby restoring a source of NGF-induced survival signals, could not prevent c-jun activation caused by NGF withdrawal from the distal axons. This is evidence that c-jun is not activated due to loss of survival signals at the cell bodies. Moreover, blocking axonal transport with colchicine inhibited c-jun activation caused by NGF deprivation suggesting that a retrogradely transported pro-apoptotic signal, rather than loss of a retrogradely transported survival signal, caused c-jun activation. Additional experiments showed that activation of c-jun, pro-caspase-3 cleavage, and apoptosis were blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitors, rottlerin and chelerythrine, only when applied to distal axons suggesting that they block the axon-specific pro-apoptotic signal. The rottlerin-sensitive mechanism was found to regulate glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity. The effect of siRNA knockdown, and pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 suggests that GSK3 is required for apoptosis caused by NGF deprivation and may function as a retrograde carrier of the axon apoptotic signal. The existence of a retrograde death signaling system in axons that is suppressed by neurotrophins has broad implications for neurodevelopment and for discovering treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and neurotrauma.","['Acetophenones', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Axonal Transport', 'Axons', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Benzopyrans', 'Caspase 3', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colchicine', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Nerve Growth Factor', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Neurons', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, trkA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sympathetic Nervous System']",19188931,"[['D02.522.120'], ['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['G03.143.355.040', 'G04.392.040', 'G11.561.050'], ['A08.675.542.145', 'A11.284.180.075', 'A11.671.137', 'A11.671.501.145'], ['D03.132.089', 'D03.633.300.633.207', 'D03.633.400.131'], ['D03.383.663.283', 'D03.633.100.150'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126.350.300', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126.350.300', 'D12.644.360.075.405.350.300', 'D12.776.476.075.405.350.300'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['D03.132.225'], ['E05.393.335.500'], ['D05.500.117.875', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.429.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.625', 'D12.644.360.300.500', 'D12.776.476.081.875', 'D12.776.476.300.500'], ['D12.644.276.860.437', 'D12.776.467.860.437', 'D12.776.631.600.437', 'D23.529.850.437'], ['D12.644.276.860', 'D12.776.467.860', 'D12.776.631.600', 'D23.529.850'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['D12.776.260.108.820', 'D12.776.624.664.700.182', 'D12.776.660.763', 'D12.776.930.127.820'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.660', 'D12.776.543.750.630.496', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.550.550'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A08.800.050.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1683,"Lung cancer among Chinese females in Singapore 1968-1992: time trends, dialect group differences and implications for aetiology.","BACKGROUND: Chinese females are distinguished internationally as having relatively high lung cancer incidence rates despite a low prevalence of cigarette smoking. In Singapore, this population comprises several dialect groups which have origins in different regions in China, each with its own traditional cultural practices.METHODS: An analysis of 4029 incident cases of the disease notified to the Singapore Cancer Registry for 1968-1992 was undertaken to provide some insight into important aetiologic factors among these women.RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rate of lung cancer rose from 17.3 per 100,000 woman-years in 1968-1972 to 23.0 in 1978-1982 before falling off in more recent years. Age-period-cohort analysis indicated significant period and birth cohort effects, with the risk being highest for women born around 1908. Between the major dialect groups, Cantonese women had a significantly high rate compared with Hokkiens (relative risk [RR] = 2.6, 95% CI: 2.4-2.8). Histologically, there appears to be an increase in the proportion of adenocarcinomas diagnosed over this period (25.8% in 1968-1972 to 51.3% in 1988-1992).CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that traditional practices which have decreased over the years, and are more prominent among Southern Chinese, may play a part in the aetiology of lung cancer locally.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'China', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Linguistics', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Singapore', 'Time Factors']",9602394,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.557.470.200.380'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['L01.559.598'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['Z01.252.145.774'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

11098,Competition of nitroxyl contrast agents as an in vivo tissue redox probe: comparison of pharmacokinetics by the bile flow monitoring (BFM) and blood circulating monitoring (BCM) methods using X-band EPR and simulation of decay profiles.,"Nitroxyl radicals used as tissue redox-sensitive contrast agents in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and/or NMR imaging should satisfy the following two conditions: 1) the molecules disperse into tissues rapidly, and 2) paramagnetic loss occurs by simple reduction of the radical. The pharmacokinetic trends of several nitroxyl contrast agents were compared with the results obtained by bile flow monitoring (BFM) and blood circulation monitoring (BCM) methods using X-band EPR. The nitroxyl radicals (TEMPO, TEMPONE (oxo-TEMPO), and amino-TEMPO) showed additional EPR signals in the bile that were attributed to metabolites formed during transport from blood to bile through the liver. However, the highly hydrophilic CAT-1 (trimethylammonium-TEMPO), which has low membrane permeability, showed minimal concentration in the bile. Probes that have carboxyl moiety, such as carboxy-TEMPO and carboxy-PROXYL, can be transported via anion transporter into hepatic cells. The EPR signal decay profiles of the nitroxyl radicals were simulated based on the experimental data. The simulation, which we previously applied to mouse blood, was modified to simultaneously fit the experimental results of BFM and BCM obtained with rats. The simulation data showed the simplicity/complexity of the pharmacokinetic mechanisms and that carbamoyl-PROXYL and TEMPOL (hydroxy-TEMPO) are suitable contrast agents for assessing tissue redox status.","['Animals', 'Bile', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Contrast Media', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Nitrogen Oxides', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",16810697,"[['B01.050'], ['A12.200.087'], ['E01.370.370.130', 'G09.330.380.630.080'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['E05.196.867.519.274'], ['D01.362.635', 'D01.625.550', 'D01.650.550.587'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45001,The development of future thinking: young children's ability to construct event sequences to achieve future goals.,"Previous studies suggest that the ability to think about and act on the future emerges between 3 and 5 years of age. However, it is unclear what underlying processes change during the development of early future-oriented behavior. We report three experiments that tested the emergence of future thinking ability through children's ability to explicitly maintain future goals and construct future scenarios. Our main objectives were to examine the effects of goal structure and the effects of working memory demands on children's ability to construct future scenarios and make choices to satisfy future goals. The results indicate that 4-year-olds were able to successfully accomplish two temporally ordered goals even with high working memory demands and a complex goal structure, whereas 3-year-olds were able to accomplish two goals only when the working memory demands were low and the goal structure did not involve additional demands from inferential reasoning and contingencies between the temporally ordered goals. Results are discussed in terms of the development of future thinking in conjunction with working memory, inferential reasoning ability, and goal maintenance abilities.","['Age Factors', 'Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Goals', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory, Short-Term', 'Thinking']",24786765,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['F01.525.200', 'G07.345.374.750'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['I01.320'], ['F01.658.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425.540.407'], ['F02.463.785']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
29901,Identification of the 18S-ribosomal-DNA genotypes of Acanthamoeba isolates from the Philippines.,"Cyst morphology has been commonly used to identify the free-living amoeba Acanthamoeba to subgenus level. A more accurate and consistent method, based on the sequence analysis of the gene coding for the amoeba's small-subunit ribosomal RNA (Rns), has, however, been developed. There have been no attempts to identify the Acanthamoeba genotypes circulating in the Philippines. In this study, therefore, the ASA.S1 region of the Rns gene from 17 Acanthamoeba isolates, collected from soil, water and contact-lens storage cases in different regions of the Philippines, was sequenced. After the isolates were genotyped, using the BLAST program, their phylogenetic positions relative to known Acanthamoeba isolates were determined. For this, the model-based (GTR + Gamma) neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian-inference analyses and the non-model-based maximum-parsimony analysis were used. All but two of the isolates were identified as the T5 or T4 genotypes, which are probably common in soil, water and contact-lens cases across the Philippines. The only other genotypes identified were T15 (as a single isolate from a contact-lens case) and T3 (as a single soil isolate).","['Acanthamoeba', 'Acanthamoeba Keratitis', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Contact Lenses', 'DNA, Protozoan', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Genotype', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Philippines', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Water Microbiology']",19000384,"[['B01.046.500.100.075.080'], ['C01.610.300.125', 'C01.610.752.049.203', 'C11.204.564.112', 'C11.294.725.125'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E07.632.500.276'], ['D13.444.308.442'], ['H01.158.273.540.274', 'N06.850.425'], ['G05.380'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['Z01.252.145.671', 'Z01.639.790'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['D13.444.735.686.675'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.555', 'N06.850.425.300'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.777', 'N06.850.425.450']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1

38800,A 3D magnetic tissue stretcher for remote mechanical control of embryonic stem cell differentiation.,"The ability to create a 3D tissue structure from individual cells and then to stimulate it at will is a major goal for both the biophysics and regenerative medicine communities. Here we show an integrated set of magnetic techniques that meet this challenge using embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We assessed the impact of magnetic nanoparticles internalization on ESCs viability, proliferation, pluripotency and differentiation profiles. We developed magnetic attractors capable of aggregating the cells remotely into a 3D embryoid body. This magnetic approach to embryoid body formation has no discernible impact on ESC differentiation pathways, as compared to the hanging drop method. It is also the base of the final magnetic device, composed of opposing magnetic attractors in order to form embryoid bodies in situ, then stretch them, and mechanically stimulate them at will. These stretched and cyclic purely mechanical stimulations were sufficient to drive ESCs differentiation towards the mesodermal cardiac pathway.The development of embryoid bodies that are responsive to external stimuli is of great interest in tissue engineering. Here, the authors culture embryonic stem cells with magnetic nanoparticles and show that the presence of magnetic fields could affect their aggregation and differentiation.","['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Embryoid Bodies', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Ferric Compounds', 'Magnetics', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",28900152,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.223', 'E05.200.500.265', 'E05.242.223', 'E05.481.500.249'], ['G04.152'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.872.700.250.260'], ['A11.872.700.250'], ['D01.490.100'], ['H01.671.493'], ['J01.637.512.600.500.144.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
24864,The inhibition of early N-glycan processing targets TRP-2 to degradation in B16 melanoma cells.,"Tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2) is a DOPAchrome tautomerase catalyzing a distal step in the melanin synthesis pathway. Similar to the other two melanogenic enzymes belonging to the TRP gene family, tyrosinase and TRP-1, TRP-2 is expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Despite the increasing evidence of its efficiency as a melanoma antigen, little is known about the maturation and intracellular trafficking of TRP-2. Here we show that TRP-2 is mainly distributed in the TGN of melanoma cells instead of being confined solely to melanosomes. This, together with the plasma membrane occasional localization observed by immunofluorescence, suggest the TRP-2 participation in a recycling pathway, which could include or not the melanosomes. Using pulse-chase experiments we show that the TRP-2 polypeptide folds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the presence of calnexin, until it reaches a dithiothreitol-resistant conformation enabling its ER exit to the Golgi. If N-glycosylation inhibitors prevent the association with calnexin, the TRP-2 nascent chain undergoes an accelerated degradation process. This process is delayed in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors, indicating that the misfolded chain is retro-translocated from the ER into the cytosol and degraded in proteasomes. This is a rare example in which calnexin although indispensable for the nascent chain folding is not required for its targeting to degradation. Therefore TRP-2 may prove to be a good model to document the calnexin-independent retro-translocation process of proteasomally degraded proteins. Clearly, TRP-2 has a distinct maturation pathway from tyrosinase and TRP-1 and possibly a second regulatory function within the cell.","['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Calnexin', 'Calreticulin', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Melanosomes', 'Mice', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Polysaccharides', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'trans-Golgi Network']",12719423,"[['B01.050'], ['G03.143.310'], ['D12.644.360.372.311', 'D12.776.157.125.412.311', 'D12.776.476.387.311', 'D12.776.503.295', 'D12.776.543.162'], ['D12.644.360.372.374', 'D12.776.157.125.412.374', 'D12.776.476.387.374', 'D12.776.503.303'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.248'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.336'], ['D08.811.399.475'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510.525', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510.525', 'C04.557.665.510.525', 'C04.619.600', 'E05.598.500.496.937'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.500.560', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.190.560', 'A11.409.750.560', 'A11.436.265.531.560', 'A11.436.613.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D05.500.562', 'D08.811.600'], ['D09.698'], ['D05.500.562.500', 'D08.811.277.656.918', 'D08.811.600.730'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['G01.154.651', 'G02.111.688'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600', 'G02.111.691.600', 'G03.734.871.790.600', 'G05.308.670.600'], ['A11.284.835'], ['A11.251.860'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.336.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
12718,"The scientific claims of British child guidance, 1918-45.","This article examines the British child guidance movement's claim to scientific status and what it sought to gain by the wider acceptance of such a claim. The period covered is from the movement's origins in the 1920s to the end of the Second World War, by which point it had been incorporated into the welfare state. This was also an era when science commanded high intellectual and cultural status. Child guidance was a form of psychiatric medicine that addressed the emotional and psychological difficulties that any child might experience. It thus saw itself as a form of preventive medicine and as a component of the international movement for mental hygiene. Child guidance was organized around the clinic and employed the knowledge and skills of three distinct professions: psychiatrists, psychologists and psychiatric social workers. Its claim to scientific status was underpinned by the movement's clinical and organizational approach and in turn derived from developments in the laboratory sciences and in academic medicine. There were, however, those even within the movement itself who challenged child guidance's purported scientific status. Such objections notwithstanding, it is suggested here that at least in its own terms the claim was justified, particularly because of the type of psychiatric approach which child guidance employed, based as it was on a form of medical holism.","['Child', 'Child Guidance', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Child, Preschool', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'United Kingdom']",20027910,"[['M01.060.406'], ['F02.784.629.272', 'F04.408.192'], ['F04.096.544.193', 'H02.403.690.130'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['K01.400.504.968'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.418', 'N01.400.500'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
15205,Decreased mortality of severe acute pancreatitis after proximal cytokine blockade.,"OBJECTIVE: This study determined the ability of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) to decrease the mortality of experimental acute pancreatitis. The response of the inflammatory cytokine cascade and its subsequent effects on pancreatic morphology were measured to determine the role of these peptides in mediating pancreatic injury.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have shown that proinflammatory cytokines are produced in large amounts during acute pancreatitis and that blockade at the level of the IL-1 receptor significantly decreases intrinsic pancreatic damage. The subsequent effect on survival is not known.METHODS: A lethal form of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis was induced in young female mice by feeding a choline-deficient, ethionine supplemented (CDE) diet for 72 hours. For determination of mortality, the animals were divided into 3 groups of 45 animals each: control subjects received 100/microL normal saline intraperitoneally every 6 hours for 5 days; IL-1ra early mice received recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist 15 mg/kg intraperitoneally every 6 hours for 5 days beginning at time 0; IL-1ra late mice received IL-1ra 15 mg/kg intraperitoneally every 6 hours for 3.5 days beginning 1.5 days after introduction of the CDE diet. A parallel experiment was conducted simultaneously with a minimum of 29 animals per group, which were sacrificed daily for comparisons of serum amylase, lipase, IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1ra, pancreatic wet weight, and blind histopathologic grading.RESULTS: The 10-day mortality in the untreated control group was 73%. Early and late IL-1ra administration resulted in decreases of mortality to 44% and 51%, respectively (both p < 0.001). Interleukin-1 antagonism also was associated with a significant attenuation in the rise in pancreatic wet weight and serum amylase and lipase in both early and late IL-1ra groups (all p < 0.05). All control animals developed a rapid elevation of the inflammatory cytokines, with maximal levels reached on day 3. The IL-1ra-treated animals, however, demonstrated a blunted rise of these mediators (all p < 0.05). Blind histologic grading revealed an overall decrease in the severity of pancreatitis in those animals receiving the antagonist.CONCLUSIONS: Early or late blockade of the cytokine cascade at the level of the IL-1 receptor significantly decreases the mortality of severe acute pancreatitis. The mechanism by which this is accomplished appears to include attenuation of systemic inflammatory cytokines and decreased pancreatic destruction.","['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Choline', 'Cytokines', 'Ethionine', 'Female', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Mice', 'Pancreatitis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sialoglycoproteins']",7794067,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.033.100.291.211', 'D02.092.063.291.211', 'D02.092.877.883.333', 'D02.675.276.232'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['D02.886.030.388', 'D12.125.166.388'], ['D12.644.276.374.460', 'D12.776.467.374.460', 'D23.529.374.460'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['C06.689.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.420.300'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['D12.644.233.800', 'D12.776.395.700']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
25848,Sickle-cell anaemia: an explanation for the ancient myth of reincarnation in Nigeria.,"The belief in reincarnation, widely held in Nigeria for many centuries, has waned in the past 30 years. It is most probable that the ""reincarnate"" child had sickle-cell anaemia, since this disease would explain all the clinical features and natural history of ""reincarnation"". Most reincarnate children died of Plasmodium falciparum or bacterial infection. The prevailing high birth rate and familial predisposition almost ensured that another sickler was born to the family. The widespread introduction of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis and therapy, the recognition of sickle-cell disease, and some measure of improvement in health care and socioeconomic standards have resulted in an increase in life expectancy for children with HbSS and consequently near-total total extinction of the people's belief in reincarnation.","['Anemia, Sickle Cell', 'Folklore', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Malaria', 'Nigeria']",6136656,"[['C15.378.071.141.150.150', 'C15.378.420.155', 'C16.320.070.150', 'C16.320.365.155'], ['I01.076.201.450.515', 'K01.517.455'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['C01.610.752.530', 'C01.920.875'], ['Z01.058.290.190.565']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
15687,Pre-treatment with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells inhibits systemic intravascular coagulation and attenuates organ dysfunction in lipopolysaccharide-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation rat model.,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can activate immunological cells to secrete various proinflammatory cytokines involved in the pathophysiological process of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during infection. In recent years, it has been found that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can affect the activity of these immune cells and regulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Here, we report the possible protective effect of BMSCs pre-treatment in LPS-induced DIC rat model and the mechanism.METHODS: Forty-eight adult male rats were divided into five experimental groups and one control group with eight animals in each group. In the treatment groups, 0, 1'10(6), 2'10(6), 3'10(6), and 5'10(6) of BMSCs were injected intravenously for 3 days before LPS injection, while the control group was treated with pure cell culture medium injection. Then, the LPS (3 mg/kg) was injected via the tail vein in the treatment groups, while the control group received 0.9% NaCl. Blood was withdrawn before and 4 and 8 hours after LPS administration. The following parameters were monitored: platelets (PLT), fibrinogen (Fib), D-dimer (D-D), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interferon-g (IFN-g), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), creatinine (Cr), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and endothelin (ET).RESULTS: Compared with the control group, a significant change of coagulation parameters were found in the experimental groups. The plasma level of the inflammatory mediator (TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-1b), organ indicator (Cr, ALT, and CK-MB), and ET in the experimental groups were much lower (P < 0.05) than that in the control group. Furthermore, some of these effects were dose-dependent; the statistical comparison of the plasma levels between the groups (from group 2 to group 5) showed a significant difference (P < 0.05), except the ALT and CK-MB levels (P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment with BMSCs can attenuate organ dysfunction and inhibit systemic intravascular coagulation effectively via the regulatory effect on immune cells and proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced DIC rat model.","['Alanine Transaminase', 'Animals', 'Blood Coagulation', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Creatinine', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Interleukin-1beta', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",22800895,"[['D08.811.913.477.700.100'], ['B01.050'], ['G09.188.390.150'], ['A11.148', 'A15.378.316'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.893', 'D12.644.276.374.480.615.350', 'D12.776.467.374.440.893', 'D12.776.467.374.480.615.350', 'D23.529.374.440.893', 'D23.529.374.480.615.350'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.010.600', 'D12.644.276.374.500.400.600', 'D12.776.467.374.465.010.600', 'D12.776.467.374.500.400.600', 'D23.529.374.465.131.600', 'D23.529.374.500.400.600'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['A11.329.830.500', 'A11.872.590.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
14377,Mucociliary activity and histopathology of sinus mucosa in experimental maxillary sinusitis: a comparison of systemic administration of antibiotic and antibiotic delivery by polylactic acid polymer.,"To evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic delivered by polyactic acid (PLA) polymer in sinusitis, we induced maxillary sinusitis in 32 New Zealand white rabbits by occluding the sinus ostium and inoculating the sinus cavity with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The rabbits were divided into three groups consisting of group 1 (control group, 8 rabbits), which was treated only by reopening the ostium; group 2, which was treated by both reopening the ostium and injecting ampicillin intramuscularly (40 mg/kg/day in three divided doses, 12 rabbits); and group 3 (12 rabbits) in which a piece of PLA-polymer ampicillin (0.326 mg) sheet (1.5 x 1.5 cm) was placed within the sinus after re-establishing ostial patency. The light microscopic findings such as epithelial ulceration, loss of cilia, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and edema were less pronounced in group 2 and minimal in group 3. The electron microscopic findings such as swelling of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum and protruded cytoplasm were severest in the control group, followed by groups 2 and 3. The mucociliary transport speed measured at the medial wall of the maxillary sinus was highest in group 3. The results of this study suggest that treatment with PLA-polymer ampicillin may have a better efficacy in maxillary sinusitis than that with systemic administration of ampicillin.","['Ampicillin', 'Animals', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Lactates', 'Lactic Acid', 'Maxillary Sinus', 'Maxillary Sinusitis', 'Mucociliary Clearance', 'Polyesters', 'Polymers', 'Rabbits', 'Treatment Outcome']",7630296,"[['D02.065.589.099.750.750.050', 'D02.886.108.750.750.050', 'D03.633.100.300.750.750.050'], ['B01.050'], ['D26.255.210', 'E02.319.300.253'], ['E02.319.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.241.511.459'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['A04.531.621.578'], ['C01.748.749.578', 'C08.460.692.752.578', 'C08.730.749.578', 'C09.603.692.752.578'], ['E01.370.386.520', 'G09.772.555'], ['D05.750.728', 'D25.720.728', 'J01.637.051.720.728'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
