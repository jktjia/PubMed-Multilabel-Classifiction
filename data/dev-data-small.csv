45536,Determinants of antenatal care utilisation in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the determinants of antenatal care (ANC) utilisation in sub-Saharan Africa.DESIGN: Systematic review.DATA SOURCES: Databases searched were PubMed, OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science.ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Primary studies reporting on determinants of ANC utilisation following multivariate analysis, conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and published in English language between 2008 and 2018.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A data extraction form was used to extract the following information: name of first author, year of publication, study location, study design, study subjects, sample size and determinants. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist for reporting a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol was used to guide the screening and eligibility of the studies. The Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies was used to assess the quality of the studies while the Andersen framework was used to report findings.RESULTS: 74 studies that met the inclusion criteria were fully assessed. Most studies identified socioeconomic status, urban residence, older/increasing age, low parity, being educated and having an educated partner, being employed, being married and Christian religion as predictors of ANC attendance and timeliness. Awareness of danger signs, timing and adequate number of antenatal visits, exposure to mass media and good attitude towards ANC utilisation made attendance and initiation of ANC in first trimester more likely. Having an unplanned pregnancy, previous pregnancy complications, poor autonomy, lack of husband's support, increased distance to health facility, not having health insurance and high cost of services negatively impacted the overall uptake, timing and frequency of antenatal visits.CONCLUSION: A variety of predisposing, enabling and need factors affect ANC utilisation in sub-Saharan Africa. Intersectoral collaboration to promote female education and empowerment, improve geographical access and strengthened implementation of ANC policies with active community participation are recommended.","['Africa South of the Sahara', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Care', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",31594900,"[['Z01.058.290'], ['N04.590.374.350', 'N05.300.430'], ['N03.349.380.420', 'N05.300.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.100.150.750.500', 'F01.145.488.887.500', 'N05.300.150.800.500'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E02.760.786', 'N02.421.143.620.704', 'N02.421.585.786'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
46038,"Effects of HSPA8, an evolutionarily conserved oviductal protein, on boar and bull spermatozoa.","Previous studies have shown that a soluble protein fraction derived from preparations of apical plasma membrane (APM) of the oviductal epithelium enhances the in vitro survival of mammalian spermatozoa. Here, we show that the survival enhancing property of the soluble protein fraction seems to depend significantly upon heat shock 70 kDa protein 8 (HSPA8 previously known as HSPA10). The following findings in the present study enabled us to draw this conclusion: first, using proteomic analysis, we identified a subset of 70 kDa oviductal surface proteins that bound to spermatozoa, one of which was HSPA8. Second, pre-treatment of the soluble protein fraction with anti-HSPA8 antibody reduced the 24 h (at 39 degrees C) sperm survival enhancement effect normally induced by the presence of 200 microg/ml soluble APM proteins. Third, complementary experiments showed that substituting the soluble protein fraction with bovine recombinant HSPA8 (0.5-2 microg/ml) also elicited the sperm survival effect. Finally, we also tested the effect of bovine recombinant HSPA8 on bull spermatozoa and found similar, dose-responsive, sperm survival promoting effects. The conserved nature of HSPA8 between mammalian species suggests that this protein may represent a common biological mechanism for the maintenance of sperm survival in the oviduct.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelium', 'Fallopian Tubes', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Spermatozoa', 'Swine']",18996976,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A11.284.149'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['A10.272'], ['A05.360.319.114.373', 'A13.706.500'], ['E02.875.800.750', 'E05.820.800.750'], ['D12.776.580.216.375.200'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['D12.776.828'], ['A05.360.490.890', 'A11.497.760'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33493,Dlx5 drives Runx2 expression and osteogenic differentiation in developing cranial suture mesenchyme.,"Craniofacial bones derive from cephalic neural crest, by endochondral or intramembranous ossification. Here, we address the role of the homeobox transcription factor Dlx5 during the initial steps of calvaria membranous differentiation and we show that Dlx5 elicits Runx2 induction and full osteoblast differentiation in embryonic suture mesenchyme grown ""in vitro"". First, we compare Dlx5 expression to bone-related gene expression in the developing skull and mandibular bones. We classify genes into three groups related to consecutive steps of ossification. Secondly, we study Dlx5 activity in osteoblast precursors, by transfecting Dlx5 into skull mesenchyme dissected prior to the onset of either Dlx5 and Runx2 expression or osteogenesis. We find that Dlx5 does not modify the proliferation rate or the expression of suture markers in the immature calvaria cells. Rather, Dlx5 initiates a complete osteogenic differentiation in these early primary cells, by triggering Runx2, osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and other gene expression according to the sequential temporal sequence observed during skull osteogenesis ""in vivo"". Thirdly, we show that BMP signaling activates Dlx5, Runx2, and alkaline phosphatase in those primary cultures and that a dominant-negative Dlx factor interferes with the ability of the BMP pathway to activate Runx2 expression. Together, these data suggest a pivotal role of Dlx5 and related Dlx factors in the onset of differentiation of chick calvaria osteoblasts.","['Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Cranial Sutures', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Mesoderm', 'Osteogenesis', 'Osteopontin', 'Transcription Factors']",17335796,"[['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.050.301.264', 'D23.101.100'], ['G04.152'], ['A11.251'], ['A13.350.150', 'A16.331.200'], ['D12.776.930.155.200.100'], ['A02.835.232.781.200'], ['D12.776.260.400'], ['A16.504.660'], ['G07.345.500.325.377.625.050.500.729', 'G11.427.578.050.500.729'], ['D12.644.276.374.625', 'D12.776.395.700.837', 'D12.776.467.374.625', 'D12.776.860.300.762', 'D23.529.374.625'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33031,"Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein gene expression, steroid-hormone secretion and proliferative activity of adrenocortical cells in the presence of proteasome inhibitors: in vivo studies on the regenerating rat adrenal cortex.","Previous studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors promote the accumulation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) in cultured rat adrenocortical cells. Unexpectedly, this response was associated with a moderate lowering in the corticosterone secretion and proliferation rate of cultured cells. Hence, we studied the effects of proteasome inhibitors MG115 and MG132 on the secretion and proliferative activity of the regenerating adrenal cortex in rats 5 days after surgery. Animals were given two subcutaneous injections of 0.15 or 1.5 nmol/100 g of inhibitors 24 and 12 h before decapitation. Real-time PCR and Western blotting showed that StAR expression, both mRNA and protein, was markedly lower in regenerating adrenals than in the intact gland of sham-operated rats. Neither MG115 nor MG132 affected StAR expression in regenerating gland. Inhibitors induced a slight decrease in the plasma concentrations of aldosterone and corticosterone, but did not significantly alter metaphase index of the regenerating adrenal cortex. Our findings provide the first evidence that down-regulation of StAR occurs during the early stages of adrenal regeneration. Moreover, this suggests that the steroidogenic pathway is more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than that regulating proliferative activity of regenerating adrenal cortex in the rat.","['Adrenal Cortex', 'Animals', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leupeptins', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Regeneration', 'Steroids']",18425351,"[['A06.300.071.140'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['G05.308'], ['D12.644.456.580'], ['D12.776.744'], ['D05.500.562.500', 'D08.811.277.656.918', 'D08.811.600.730'], ['D27.505.519.389.745.705'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['G16.762'], ['D04.210.500']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27389,Protein-RNA Dynamics in the Central Junction Control 30S Ribosome Assembly.,"Interactions between ribosomal proteins (rproteins) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) facilitate the formation of functional ribosomes. S15 is a central domain primary binding protein that has been shown to trigger a cascade of conformational changes in 16S rRNA, forming the functional structure of the central domain. Previous biochemical and structural studies in vitro have revealed that S15 binds a three-way junction of helices 20, 21, and 22, including nucleotides 652-654 and 752-754. All junction nucleotides except 653 are highly conserved among the Bacteria. To identify functionally important motifs within the junction, we subjected nucleotides 652-654 and 752-754 to saturation mutagenesis and selected and analyzed functional mutants. Only 64 mutants with greater than 10% ribosome function in vivo were isolated. S15 overexpression complemented mutations in the junction loop in each of the partially active mutants, although mutations that produced inactive ribosomes were not complemented by overexpression of S15. Single-molecule F?rster or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) was used to study the Mg(2+)- and S15-induced conformational dynamics of selected junction mutants. Comparison of the structural dynamics of these mutants with the wild type in the presence and absence of S15 revealed specific sequence and structural motifs in the central junction that are important in ribosome function.","['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Magnesium', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Ribosome Subunits, Small, Bacterial']",27192112,"[['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['E05.196.712.516.600.676.500', 'G01.154.240.280', 'G02.111.255.280'], ['E05.393.281.526'], ['D05'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['G03.493.750'], ['D13.444.735.686.670'], ['D12.776.835'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.811.870.750.700', 'A20.874']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
22351,High- versus low-top shoes for the prevention of ankle sprains in basketball players. A prospective randomized study.,"Using a prospective, randomized experimental design, 622 college intramural basketball players were stratified by a previous history of ankle sprains to wear a new pair of either high-top, high-top with inflatable air chambers, or low-top basketball shoes during all games for a complete season. Subjects were asked to complete a history questionnaire and were given a complete ankle examination. They were allowed to wear these shoes only during basketball competition. Followed over the course of a 2-month intramural season, 15 ankle injuries occurred during 39,302 minutes of player-time: 7 in high-top shoes, 4 in low-top shoes, and 4 in high-top shoes with inflatable air chambers. The injury rates (injuries per player-minute) were 4.80 x 10(-4) in high-top shoes, 4.06 x 10(-4) in low-top shoes, and 2.69 x 10(-4) in high-top shoes with inflatable air chambers. There was no significant difference among these 3 groups, leading to the conclusion that there is no strong relationship between shoe type and ankle sprains.","['Adult', 'Ankle Injuries', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Basketball', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'Research Design', 'Shoes', 'Sprains and Strains']",8368420,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C26.558.100'], ['C26.115'], ['I03.450.642.845.117'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.370.700', 'E05.581.500.805', 'N05.715.360.325.675', 'N06.850.520.445.700'], ['E05.581.500', 'H01.770.644.728'], ['J01.637.215.800'], ['C26.844']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
35627,Molecular cloning and functional analysis of porcine SULT1A1 gene and its variant: a single mutation SULT1A1 causes a significant decrease in sulfation activity.,"The characterization of the SULT1A1 gene and its variants should have an important impact on the efforts to develop genetic markers to select for low skatole in pigs. Raising intact male pigs would have a significant economic impact on the pork industry; however, the presence of skatole (a major cause of boar taint) in meat from male pigs would be highly objectionable to consumers. It has been shown that the phase II metabolism of skatole metabolites by phenol sulfotransferase is related to the clearance of skatole in the liver. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the SULT1A1 gene from pig liver, examine its expression, identify genetic polymorphisms, and study how a genetic variation in this enzyme translates into interindividual variation in skatole levels. We show here that a substitution of A-->G at base 546 of SULT1A1 causes a significant decrease in its sulfation activity and thus may be at least partially responsible for a higher level of skatole in pigs. Our findings provide an important basis toward the goal of making it possible to predict the sulfation status in pigs and the development of genetic markers for low skatole.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Arylsulfotransferase', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Library', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Skatole', 'Sulfates', 'Swine']",15014971,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['J01.040.090'], ['B01.050'], ['D08.811.913.817.400.300'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A11.251.210.172.500', 'A11.329.228.220'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.126.110'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['G05.360.325'], ['A03.620'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['G05.365.795.600'], ['E05.393.751'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['D03.633.100.473.808'], ['D01.248.497.158.845', 'D01.875.800.800.850'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
43097,Identification of a protective CD4+ T-cell epitope in p15gag of Friend murine leukemia virus and role of the MA protein targeting the plasma membrane in immunogenicity.,"Recent studies have demonstrated an essential role of Gag-specific CD4+ T-cell responses for viral control in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. However, little is known about epitope specificities and functional roles of the Gag-specific helper T-cell responses in terms of vaccine-induced protection against a pathogenic retroviral challenge. We have previously demonstrated that immunization with Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) Gag proteins protects mice against the fatal Friend retrovirus (FV) infection. We report here the structure of a protective T helper cell (Th) epitope, (I)VTWEAIAVDPPP, identified in the p15 (MA) region of F-MuLV Gag. In mice immunized with the Th epitope-harboring peptide or a vaccinia virus-expressed native full-length MA protein, FV-induced early splenomegaly regressed rapidly. In these mice, FV-infected cells were eliminated within 4 weeks and the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies was induced rapidly after FV challenge, resulting in strong protection against the virus infection. Interestingly, mice immunized with the whole MA mounted strong CD4+ T-cell responses to the identified Th epitope, whereas mice immunized with mutant MA proteins that were not bound to the plasma membrane failed to mount efficient CD4+ T-cell responses, despite the presence of the Th epitope. These mutant MA proteins also failed to induce strong protection against FV challenge. These data indicate the importance of the properly processible MA molecule for CD4+ T-cell priming and for the resultant induction of an effective immune response against retrovirus infections.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections', 'Tumor Virus Infections', 'Viral Vaccines']",15163726,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200'], ['D23.050.550.402'], ['B04.613.807.375.525.225', 'B04.820.650.375.525.225'], ['D12.776.775.330', 'D12.776.964.775.350', 'D12.776.964.970.600.850.350'], ['C04.557.337.372', 'C04.619.531', 'E05.598.500.496.500'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['C01.925.782.815'], ['C01.925.928'], ['D20.215.894.899']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1923,Loss of TRIM29 Alters Keratin Distribution to Promote Cell Invasion in Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,": TRIM29 (tripartite motif-containing protein 29) is a TRIM family protein that has been implicated in breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. However, its role in stratified squamous epithelial cells and tumors has not been elucidated. Here, we investigate the expression of TRIM29 in cutaneous head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and its functions in the tumorigenesis of such cancers. TRIM29 expression was lower in malignant SCC lesions than in adjacent normal epithelial tissue or benign tumors. Lower expression of TRIM29 was associated with higher SCC invasiveness. Primary tumors of cutaneous SCC showed aberrant hypermethylation of TRIM29. Depletion of TRIM29 increased cancer cell migration and invasion; conversely, overexpression of TRIM29 suppressed these. Comprehensive proteomics and immunoprecipitation analyses identified keratins and keratin-interacting protein FAM83H as TRIM29 interactors. Knockdown of TRIM29 led to ectopic keratin localization of keratinocytes. In primary tumors, lower TRIM29 expression correlated with the altered expression of keratins. Our findings reveal an unexpected role for TRIM29 in regulating the distribution of keratins, as well as in the migration and invasion of SCC. They also suggest that the TRIM29-keratin axis could serve as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in stratified epithelial tumors and may provide a target for SCC therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify TRIM29 as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker in stratified epithelial tissues.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes', 'Keratins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transcription Factors']",30389700,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C04.697.098', 'C23.550.727.098'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G02.111.035.538.161', 'G02.111.218', 'G03.059.538.161', 'G05.206'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G05.308.370'], ['C04.588.443'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.409.500', 'A11.436.397'], ['D05.750.078.593.450', 'D12.776.220.475.450', 'D12.776.860.607'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['C04.697.650', 'C23.550.727.650'], ['E05.624'], ['E01.789'], ['D12.776'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
31560,An epidemiologic study on aging and dysphagia in the acute care hospitalized population: 2000-2007.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe total and yearly demographic trends relative to aging, dysphagia referral rates and oral feeding status in hospitalized patients from 2000 through 2007.METHODS: We evaluated a prospective, consecutive, referred sample of 4,038 hospitalized patients in an urban, tertiary, acute care teaching hospital. Dysphagia referral rates are described according to year, age (decade), sex, admitting diagnostic category, results of dysphagia evaluations and oral feeding status. Diagnosis of dysphagia and feeding status were assessed objectively with fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing.RESULTS: Dysphagia referral rates doubled between 2000 and 2007, with increases of 20% per year and increases in all decades from 2002 through 2007. Over 70% of dysphagia referrals were for older patients of 60 years and above, and over 42% of these were old old patients over 80 years. Referrals for 80 to 89-year-old patients almost doubled and for patients over 90 years more than tripled between 2000 and 2007. Of older patients over 60 years, 62.3% (1,771/2,843) did not exhibit dysphagia, 18.0% (513/2,843) benefited from specific diet modifications to reduce aspiration risk and 19.7% (559/2,843) were made nil-by-mouth due to severe dysphagia and aspiration.CONCLUSIONS: From 2000 to 2007, dysphagia referrals across all ages increased by 20% each year, with more referrals for older (70.4%) than younger patients (29.6%). Referrals almost doubled for 80 to 89-year-old patients and more than tripled for patients over 90 years. This increase will necessitate additional trained dysphagia specialists at least through 2050 and probably longer.","['Acute Disease', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis-Related Groups', 'Eating', 'Endoscopy, Digestive System', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Risk Factors']",19707014,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G07.345.124'], ['G10.261.178'], ['C06.405.117.119', 'C09.775.174'], ['N03.219.521.710.305.200.080'], ['G07.203.650.283', 'G10.261.330'], ['E01.370.372.250', 'E01.370.388.250.250', 'E04.210.240', 'E04.502.250.250'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['N02.278.020.300', 'N02.278.421.639'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['N04.452.758.849'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

Results and study of contrast sensitivity].,"PURPOSE: To examine the results of retreatment with eximer laser photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) on refraction, visual acuity, haze, and contrast sensitivity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy was performed in 18 patients, once for one eye and twice for the other eye due to undercorrection or regression. Outcome was compared between the two eyes.RESULTS: Uncorrected visual acuity was above 20/40 in 94.4% of the retreated eyes. There was no statistical difference between the two eyes for haze and contrast sensitivity.CONCLUSION: Retreatment with laser photorefractive keratectomy is a safe procedure and should be performed when regression or undercorrection occurs after the first laser excimer treatment.","['Adult', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lasers, Excimer', 'Male', 'Myopia', 'Photorefractive Keratectomy', 'Reoperation', 'Visual Acuity']",10794980,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.380.850.950.500', 'F02.463.593.778.435.110', 'F02.463.593.932.281', 'F02.463.593.932.901.500', 'G14.940.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E07.632.490.244', 'E07.710.520.244'], ['C11.744.636'], ['E02.594.480.875', 'E04.014.520.480.875', 'E04.378.500.875', 'E04.540.825.437.500'], ['E04.690'], ['E01.370.380.850.950', 'F02.463.593.932.901', 'G14.940']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
22454,Activation of the kallikrein-kinin system in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).,"Plasma prekallikrein levels, kallikrein activity and antikallikrein levels were investigated in nine premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and six premature infants without. Plasma prekallikrein and kallikrein were determined with a chromogenic substrate measuring amidolytic activity. Antikallikrein was measured with a functional assay. In infants with severe RDS, prekallikrein levels were significantly reduced (median 58% of initial values (p less than 0.01) about 48 hours after onset of symptoms. In infants with moderate RDS prekallikrein level was reduced less, while in babies without RDS there were no significant changes in prekallikrein levels the first 5-7 days of life. Antikallikrein levels did not change significantly in any babies. The results suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system might be involved in RDS. This could explain several features of this syndrome such as hypotension and edema. Furthermore the findings show that homeostatic functions are altered in this disease, and they suggest that other cascade systems as the coagulation, fibrinolytic and complement system may be involved as well. The findings emphasize that trauma might be a significant pathogenetical factor for development of this syndrome and indicate that RDS is not simply a biochemical disease with lack of surfactant as the only pathogenetic factor.","['Blood Gas Analysis', 'Blood Proteins', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kallikreins', 'Kinins', 'Prekallikrein', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn']",6925441,"[['E01.370.225.124.100.100', 'E01.370.386.700.100', 'E05.200.124.100.100'], ['D12.776.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.442', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.442', 'D12.776.124.125.597', 'D23.119.597'], ['D12.644.276.812', 'D12.776.467.812', 'D23.469.050.375', 'D23.529.812'], ['D08.622.658', 'D08.811.277.656.300.760.442.725', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.442.725', 'D12.776.124.125.597.712', 'D12.776.811.243.658', 'D23.119.597.712'], ['C08.381.840.500', 'C08.618.840.500', 'C16.614.521.563']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
27671,Development of nickel-doped lithium formate as potential EPR dosimeter for low dose determination.,"EPR dosimetry employing L-alpha-alanine has been in vogue during the past few years, due to its tissue equivalence and linear dose response. However, L-alpha-alanine dosimetry has been improved during the past years, the sensitivity of this material is still too low for clinical applications. Polycrystalline lithium formate doped with NiCl2 was therefore examined for radiation response in the dose range of clinical interest (<5 Gy) using CW EPR and pulse EPR techniques. At equal and moderate settings of microwave power and modulation amplitude lithium formate doped with 1.6 wt% of NiCl2 was almost four times more sensitive compared to L-alpha-alanine, which is the most common EPR dosimeter standard. It was shown that the nickel-doped lithium formate has an excellent radiation response with a low limit of the measurable dose, and a linear dose response in the range 1-5 Gy. The relaxation and power saturation studies showed that high microwave power can be applied during measurements to improve the sensitivity of this material as an EPR dosimeter. These results show that lithium formate doped with Ni(II) exhibits promising properties required for further development of an EPR dosimeter in the dose range typical for clinical dosimetry.","['Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Formates', 'Free Radicals', 'Microwaves', 'Nickel', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry', 'Spin Labels']",17129756,"[['E05.196.867.519.274'], ['D02.241.081.420'], ['D01.339', 'D02.389'], ['G01.358.500.505.810.500', 'G01.750.250.810.500', 'G01.750.770.721.500'], ['D01.268.556.607', 'D01.268.956.625', 'D01.552.544.607'], ['E05.799.513', 'G01.750.740', 'N06.850.810.250'], ['E05.799'], ['D02.389.678']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
20899,Target organ damage and associated clinical conditions among Nigerians with treated hypertension.,"AIM: Systemic hypertension is the commonest noncommunicable disease in Nigeria. Hypertension is linked with certain target organ damage (TOD) and associated clinical conditions (ACC). This study assessed the extent, pattern and predictors of TOD/ACC in patients with hypertension in Nigeria.METHODS: The study was carried out at the medical outpatient department of a state hospital in Nigeria. Target organ damage was assessed in these patients. Predictors of TOD/ACC were also sought.RESULTS: A total of 203 patients [73 men (36.0%) and 130 women (64.0%)] constituted the study population. One hundred and twenty-two patients (60.1%) had TOD/ACC. The prevalent TOD/ACC were left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (31.0%), chronic kidney disease (18.2%), diabetic nephropathy (18.2%), heart failure (10.8%) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) (8.9%). There was a statistically significant association between systolic blood pressure and TOD/ACC. Patients with over all blood pressure (BP) control (i.e. BP < 140/90 mmHg) had more TOD compared with those that had overall uncontrolled BP (i.e. BP > or = 140/90 mmHg) although the difference was not statistically significant (Chi2= 1.5, p > 0.05). The association between length of treatment and TOD/ACC approached significance ( Chi2= 9.35, p = 0.053).CONCLUSION: The study showed a high prevalence of TOD/ACC in treated hypertensives. A positive association was shown between systolic BP and TOD/ACC. Early detection of hypertension and strict blood pressure control should help in reducing TOD/ACC in the hypertensive population.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Blood Pressure', 'Diabetic Nephropathies', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Prevalence', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Systole']",15915275,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.411.162'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['C12.777.419.192', 'C13.351.968.419.192', 'C19.246.099.875'], ['C14.280'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['C12.777.419', 'C13.351.968.419'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.058.290.190.565'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['C11.768'], ['G09.330.580.880', 'G11.427.494.570.880']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
28040,Neonatal caffeine exposure and seizure susceptibility in adult rats.,"Early developmental exposure to caffeine in rats results in changes in brain excitability that persist to adulthood. The mechanism of these alterations is unknown. To identify potential neurotransmitter systems involved, we exposed neonatal rats to caffeine and determined seizure thresholds for chemoconvulsants active at different CNS receptors in the adult animal. Rats were unhandled (NH) or received by gavage (0.05 ml/10 g) either vehicle (water) or caffeine (15-20 mg/kg/day) for postnatal days 2-6. At age 70-90 days, each rat was infused intravenously (i.v.) with picrotoxin (PIC), bicuculline (BIC) [convulsants acting at the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine (GABA/BDZ) receptor], pentylenetetrazol [PTZ, possibly acting at both GABA/BDZ and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors], caffeine (acting at adenosine receptors), strychnine (STR, acting at glycine receptors), or kainic acid (KA, acting at the NMDA receptor). Seizure thresholds were analyzed as a function of neonatal treatment and sex. Thresholds for caffeine, PTZ, PIC, and KA were increased as a function of neonatal caffeine exposure (p = 0.01, 0.02, 0.02, and 0.005, respectively). The thresholds for BIC and STR were not altered. There were also gender differences in seizure susceptibility. Thresholds for seizures produced by BIC, caffeine, PIC, and STR were higher in females (p = 0.005, 0.005, 0.001, and 0.0001, respectively), but were not different for seizures caused by PTZ. These results suggest that early developmental exposure to caffeine affects later seizure susceptibility. Moreover, some of these effects are gender specific.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bicuculline', 'Brain', 'Caffeine', 'Female', 'Kainic Acid', 'Male', 'Pentylenetetrazole', 'Picrotoxin', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1', 'Seizures', 'Sex Factors', 'Strychnine']",7635092,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['D03.132.098.077', 'D03.633.100.531.085.077'], ['A08.186.211'], ['D03.132.960.175', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824.175'], ['D03.383.773.400'], ['D03.383.066.600'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.367.800', 'D02.540.552'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.700.700', 'D12.776.543.750.720.700.700'], ['C10.597.742', 'C23.888.592.742'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['D03.132.436.681.722', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.722', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.722']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
40587,"Heat stress induces a glycosylation of membrane sterol in myxoamoebae of a true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.","To know the very early events occurring after heat shock, the changes of membrane lipids were examined. Heat stress induced the production of a certain glycolipid in the myxoamoebae of Physarum polycephalum in a few minutes. The purified glycolipid was determined to be a poriferasterol monoglucoside by structural studies that was previously reported to be expressed during the differentiation of Physarum cells from haploid myxoamoebae to diploid plasmodia (Murakami-Murofushi, K., Nakamura, K., Ohta, J., Suzuki, M., Suzuki, A., Murofushi, H., and Yokota, T.

Acta 992, 412-415) was also expressed rapidly after heat shock. Thus, the activation of sterol glucosyltransferase and the production of sterol-glucoside were considered to be important events that were involved in the signal transduction system to induce some succeeding heat-shock responses, such as the synthesis of heat-shock proteins.","['Animals', 'Glucosyltransferases', 'Glycolipids', 'Glycosylation', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Physarum polycephalum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sterols']",8995287,"[['B01.050'], ['D08.811.913.400.450.460'], ['D09.400.410', 'D10.390'], ['G02.111.158.812', 'G02.607.299', 'G03.191.812'], ['C26.522'], ['E05.196.566'], ['D10.570'], ['B01.046.550.550.600.700.550'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D04.210.500.247.808', 'D10.570.938']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25567,Use of body mass index of adults in assessing individual and community nutritional status.,"Adult malnutrition is much more widespread than is commonly recognized. Described in this article is the use of body mass index (BMI = weight in kg/(height in metres)2) as a measure of adult nutritional status, both of individuals and of communities. Concurrent assessment of the nutritional status of children and adults permits conclusions to be drawn about whether there is generalized undernutrition in a community or whether other factors (e.g., childhood infections or feeding practices) are more important in childhood malnutrition. Included is a tabular presentation that permits rapid assessment of both thinness or underweight (BMI values < 16, 17 and 18.5) and overweight (BMI > 25, 30 and 40). Examples of the use of BMI in both clinical and public health practice are also given.","['Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Nutritional Status', 'Obesity', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Thinness']",8846494,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.585', 'N05.715.360.300.560', 'N06.850.505.557', 'N06.850.520.308.585'], ['E05.318.308.980.485', 'N05.715.360.300.800.469', 'N06.850.505.616', 'N06.850.520.308.980.469'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['H02.403.720', 'N01.400.550', 'N06.850'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['C23.888.144.828', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.828', 'G07.100.100.160.120.828']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
2706,Bilirubin mediated oxidative stress involves antioxidant response activation via Nrf2 pathway.,"Unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is responsible for neonatal jaundice and high level of free bilirubin (Bf) can lead to kernicterus. Previous studies suggest that oxidative stress is a critical component of UCB-induced neurotoxicity. The Nrf2 pathway is a powerful sensor for cellular redox state and is activated directly by oxidative stress and/or indirectly by stress response protein kinases. Activated Nrf2 translocates to nucleus, binds to Antioxidant Response Element (ARE), and enhances the up-regulation of cytoprotective genes that mediate cell survival. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Nrf2 pathway in cell response to bilirubin mediated oxidative stress in the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Cells exposed to a toxic concentration of UCB (140 nM Bf) showed an increased intracellular ROS levels and enhanced nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 protein. UCB stimulated transcriptional induction of ARE-GFP reporter gene and induced mRNA expression of multiple antioxidant response genes as: xCT, Gly1, ãGCL-m, ãGCL-c, HO-1, NQO1, FTH, ME1, and ATF3. Nrf2 siRNA decreased UCB induced mRNA expression of HO1 (75%), NQO1 (54%), and FTH (40%). The Nrf2-related HO-1 induction was reduced to 60% in cells pre-treated with antioxidant (NAC) or specific signaling pathway inhibitors for PKC, P38á and MEK1/2 (80, 40 and 25%, respectively). In conclusion, we demonstrated that SH-SY5Y cells undergo an adaptive response against UCB-mediated oxidative stress by activation of multiple antioxidant response, in part through Nrf2 pathway.","['Acetylcysteine', 'Activating Transcription Factor 3', 'Antioxidant Response Elements', 'Antioxidants', 'Apoferritins', 'Bilirubin', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Kinase C', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",24308969,"[['D02.886.030.230.259', 'D12.125.166.230.259'], ['D12.776.260.108.061.875', 'D12.776.930.127.061.875'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675.700.040', 'G05.360.080.689.675.700.040', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680.765.040'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['D12.776.070.345', 'D12.776.157.427.249.290', 'D12.776.556.579.249.290'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.249.184', 'D03.633.400.909.249.184', 'D04.345.783.249.184', 'D23.767.193.184'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.346'], ['D27.505.519.217.500'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.410.500'], ['A11.251.860.180.432', 'A11.436.348.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.565.100', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.200.100', 'D12.644.360.440.100', 'D12.776.476.440.100'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.565.200', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.200.200', 'D12.644.360.440.200', 'D12.776.476.440.200'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.843.937', 'D12.644.360.450.835.800', 'D12.776.476.450.835.937'], ['D08.811.682.608.800.500'], ['D12.776.260.108.737', 'D12.776.930.127.737'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['D01.339.431', 'D01.650.775'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['G05.308.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
709,"Precise diagnosis of infection in burn wound biopsy specimens. Combination of histologic technique, acridine orange staining, and culture.","This study developed a rapid manual histologic technique on burn wound biopsy specimens for an early diagnosis of infection. A total of 86 biopsy specimens were processed using this rapid manual method, acridine orange fluorescent staining for the detection of microorganisms, and a quantitative culture for the identification and counting of bacteria in adjacent homogenized biopsy specimens. Use of these three techniques has shown their complementarity for the evaluation of sepsis in burn wound patients. The histologic study allowed a classification of the depth of bacterial involvement 4 hours after specimen collection, whereas the acridine orange fluorescent staining was useful for quantitative evaluation of infection in the same delay. Thus a rapid therapeutic decision can be made while waiting for the results of quantitative culture and sensitivity tests, which require 24 to 48 hours. We propose routine monitoring of burned patients consisting of these three tests performed simultaneously on each biopsy specimen.","['Acridine Orange', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biopsy', 'Burns', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Time Factors', 'Wound Infection']",2473075,"[['D03.633.300.046.250.150'], ['C01.150.252'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C26.200'], ['E01.370.225.750', 'E05.200.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670', 'E05.200.500.620.670', 'E05.200.750.600.670'], ['G01.910.857'], ['C01.947']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
36708,Dynamic CT in pancreatic lymphoma.,"We retrospectively reviewed the dynamic CT examinations of eight patients with pancreatic lymphoma. Four tumors were rounded masses with well-defined contours, four were more infiltrating lesions. The median cross-sectional diameter of the tumors was 6 cm (range 2.5-12 cm). At dynamic CT, the tumors were hypodense (n = 8) and somewhat heterogeneous (n = 6). Additional features were enlarged lymph nodes, 1-3 cm in diameter (n = 5), dilatation of the biliary tract and pancreatic duct (n = 5), abnormalities in the fat around the celiac trunk and/or the superior mesenteric artery (n = 4), and venous stenosis or occlusion (n = 7). The CT findings of pancreatic lymphoma are more various than has been previously reported. Findings such as small tumor size, well-defined contours, tumor heterogeneity, pancreatic duct dilatation, and venous invasion may be seen.

24719,Simultaneous time-lamination imaging of protein association using a split fluorescent timer protein.,"Studies of temporal behaviors of protein association in living cells are crucially important for elucidating the fundamental roles and the mechanism of interactive coordination for cell activities. We developed a method for investigating the temporal alternation of a particular protein assembly using monomeric fluorescent proteins, fluorescent timers (FTs), of which the fluorescent color changes from blue to red over time. We identified a dissection site of the FTs, which allows complementation of the split FT fragments. The split fragments of each FT variant recovered their fluorescence and maintained inherent rates of the color changes upon the reassembly of the fragments in vitro. We applied this method to visualize the aggregation process of á-synuclein in living cells. The size of the aggregates with the temporal information was analyzed from ratio values of the blue and red fluorescence of the reconstituted FTs, from which the aggregation rates were evaluated. This method using the split FT fragments enables tracing and visualizing temporal alternations of various protein associations by single fluorescence measurements at a given time point.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Imaging', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Time Factors', 'alpha-Synuclein']",25679333,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.532'], ['E05.599.595'], ['E01.370.350.557', 'E05.601.555'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.644.541'], ['G02.111.694'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.600'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D12.776.631.860.500', 'D12.776.637.500']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
21262,Subtype-specific intracellular trafficking of alpha2-adrenergic receptors.,"The three alpha2-adrenergic receptor subtypes (alpha2a, alpha2b, and alpha2c) are highly homologous G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors all couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and have relatively similar pharmacological properties. To further explore functional differences between these receptors, we used immunocytochemical techniques to compare the ability of the three alpha2-receptor subtypes to undergo agonist-mediated internalization. The alpha2a-receptor does not internalize after agonist treatment. In contrast, we observed that the alpha2b-receptor is able to undergo agonist-induced internalization and seems to follow the same endosomal pathway used by the beta2-adrenergic receptor. Attempts to examine internalization of the alpha2c-receptor were complicated by the fact that the majority of the alpha2c receptor resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and cis/media Golgi and there is relatively little cell surface localization. Nevertheless, we were able to detect some internalization of the alpha2c-receptor after prolonged agonist treatment. However, we observed no significant movement of alpha2c-receptor from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane during a 4-hr treatment of cells with cycloheximide, suggesting that these cells are unable to process alpha2c-receptors in the same way they process the alpha2a or alpha2b subtypes.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Techniques', 'Dogs', 'Endocytosis', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2']",9145909,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G03.143'], ['A11.251.210.172.500', 'A11.329.228.220'], ['A11.251.210'], ['E05.481.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G04.417'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.248'], ['A11.329.228'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.300.300.300.200', 'D12.776.543.750.695.150.300.300.725', 'D12.776.543.750.720.330.300.300.200']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
10985,Challenged but not threatened: Managing health in advanced age.,"In this paper we reflect on discussions with people of advanced age in ?otearoa New Zealand, and draw on theoretical frameworks of resilience and place in old age, to explore insights about the ways older people maintain quality of life and health. Twenty community-dwelling people of advanced age (85+) were recruited in 2015-16 from a large multidisciplinary longitudinal study of advanced age. These twenty participated in interviews about health in advanced age, impact of illnesses, interactions with clinicians, access to information, support for managing health, and perceptions of primary care, medications, and other forms of assistance. We use a positioning theory framework drawing on thematic and narrative analysis to understand the dynamic ways people in advanced age position themselves and the ways they age well through speech acts and storylines. People in advanced age saw themselves as challenged, rather than threatened, by adversities, and positioned themselves as able to draw on a lifetime of experience and resourcefulness and collaborations with supporters to deal with challenges. Key strategies include downplaying illness and resisting biomedical discourses of complexity, positioning embodied selves as having agency, and creative adaptation in the face of loss. People in advanced age exhibit resilience, maintaining wellbeing, autonomy and good physical and mental quality of life even while living with challenges such as functional decline and multi-morbidities. These findings have significance for supporters of older people, emphasising the need to move away from a narrow focus on problems to working together WITH people in advanced age to offer a more holistic approach that encourages and enhances adaptation and flexibility, rather than rigid and counterproductive coping patterns.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'New Zealand', 'Qualitative Research', 'Resilience, Psychological']",29941204,"[['F01.058'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['Z01.639.760.747', 'Z01.678.100.747'], ['H01.770.644.241.850'], ['F02.940']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
37326,Multiple pre- and postreceptor defects in pseudohypoparathyroidism (a multicenter study with twenty four patients).,"Three different pathophysiological mechanisms are probably responsible for hereditary pseudohypoparathyroidism: 1) a defect at the prereceptor-level, 2) a defective membrane N-protein accounting for diminished second messenger production, and 3) a defect in the cytosolic response to the hormone. In a cooperative, study 24 patients (mean age, 13 yr; range, 3-23 yr, 8 girls, 16 boys) receiving vitamin D metabolites (5,000-80,000 U/day) were examined and compared to a control group of 36 normal children. Immunoreactive N-terminal PTH (N-PTH), mid-C-regional PTH (mid-C-PTH), intact PTH and bio-PTH, vitamin D metabolites, and serum calcium and phosphate, alkaline phosphatase activity, and the N-protein activity of erythrocyte membranes were measured in each subject. By clinical and biochemical criteria three groups were differentiated. Eight patients had the completely expressed features of Albright's Hereditary Osteodystrophy (AHO+), including brachydactyly and/or sc calcifications, and increased N-PTH, mid-C-PTH, and alkaline phosphatase activity. Bio-PTH, intact PTH, and N-protein were normal. Nine additional patients with complete (AHO+) had elevated levels of bio-PTH, N-PTH, and mid-C PTH, normal hydroxylation of vitamin D, but decreased N-protein activity. Seven patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism had no features of AHO (AHO-), no increase of urinary cAMP excretion after exogenous PTH, normal PTH peptide levels and N-protein activity, but elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D and decreased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations. In conclusion, we identified three subpopulations of PsHP: group a had a dissociation of N-PTH and bio-PTH suggesting a defective N-PTH causing renal resistance, whereas their bones respond to PTH. Group b had defective N-protein causing generalized PTH resistance. Group c was characterized by high 25-hydroxyvitamin D and relatively low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels, thus providing evidence for a defect in the cytosolic interaction of the two different second messengers for PTH, cAMP, and calcium.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Calcium', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Female', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Phosphates', 'Prolactin', 'Pseudohypoparathyroidism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Parathyroid Hormone', 'Vitamin D']",3001127,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300', 'D12.776.157.325'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374', 'D01.248.497.158.730', 'D01.695.625.675.650'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.773', 'D06.472.699.631.525.525', 'D12.644.548.691.525.525'], ['C05.116.198.709', 'C16.320.565.618.815', 'C18.452.104.709', 'C18.452.174.766', 'C18.452.648.618.815'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.650', 'D12.776.543.750.750.600'], ['D04.210.500.812.768']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
14124,Phase II Study of Modified Carboplatin Plus Weekly Nab-Paclitaxel in Elderly Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: North Japan Lung Cancer Study Group Trial 1301.,"LESSONS LEARNED: Weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound-paclitaxel (75 mg/m2) in combination with carboplatin (area under the curve 6 mg/mL/min) in elderly patients with previously untreated, advanced non-small cell lung cancer showed favorable efficacy, was well tolerated, and showed less neuropathic toxicity.This modified regimen offers potential for the treatment of elderly patients.BACKGROUND: The CA031 trial suggested weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound-paclitaxel (nab-PTX) was superior in efficacy to paclitaxel (PTX) once every 3 weeks when combined with carboplatin (CBDCA) for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; a subgroup analysis of elderly patients looked promising. In a multicenter phase II trial, we prospectively evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of modified CBDCA plus weekly nab-PTX for elderly patients with untreated advanced NSCLC.METHODS: Eligible patients received CBDCA (area under the curve [AUC] 6 mg/mL/min) on day 1 and nab-PTX (75 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was an overall response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.RESULTS: Of 32 patients (median age of 78 years), 84% were male, 56% had stage IV NSCLC, and 56% had squamous cell carcinoma. ORR and disease control rates were 50% (95% confidence interval (CI): 33-67) and 94% (95% CI: 85-100), respectively. Median PFS and OS were 6.4 months (95% CI: 4.8-8.0) and 17.5 months (95% CI: 11.9-23.1), respectively. Grade ?3 toxicities were neutropenia (47%), leukopenia (38%), anemia (34%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and anorexia (9%). Febrile neutropenia and treatment-related deaths were not observed.CONCLUSION: Modified CBDCA plus weekly nab-PTX demonstrated significant efficacy and acceptable toxicities in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Albumins', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Carboplatin', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Paclitaxel', 'Treatment Outcome']",28526722,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D12.776.034'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D02.257.125'], ['C04.588.894.797.520.109.220.249', 'C08.381.540.140.500', 'C08.785.520.100.220.500'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['C25.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888.777', 'D02.455.849.291.850.777'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
26508,"The relation among aldosterone, galectin-3, and myocardial fibrosis: a prospective clinical pilot follow-up study.","UNLABELLED: Primary aldosteronism has been associated with myocardial fibrosis, and is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. We previously showed that aldosterone can induce the secretion of galectin-3. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between myocardial fibrosis and plasma galectin-3 level in patients with primary aldosteronism. We prospectively analyzed 11 patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) who received adrenalectomy from December 2006 to October 2008, and 17 patients with essential hypertension as controls. Levels of plasma galectin-3 were determined in both groups, and both groups underwent echocardiography with cyclic variations of integrated backscatter (CVIBS) to characterize tissue initially and 1 year after surgery in the APA group. Diastolic blood pressure, concentration of plasma aldosterone and aldosterone-renin ratio were significantly higher, and serum potassium level and plasma renin activity significantly lower in the APA group compared to the controls. In addition, left ventricular mass index was significantly higher and CVIBS significantly lower in the APA group (7.3±2.0 vs 9.2±1.7 dB, p=0.015). Furthermore, the concentration of plasma galectin-3 was significantly higher in the APA group (2.1±0.9 vs 1.1±0.6 ng/mL, p=0.005) compared to the controls. CVIBS was correlated to plasma galectin-3 level. In the APA group, CVIBS increased significantly (7.3±2.0 to 9.2±2.4 dB, p=0.032) and plasma galectin-3 decreased (2.1±0.9 to 1.2±0.6, p=0.049) 1 year postadrenalectomy. The patients with APA had increased myocardial fibrosis, and this was associated with a higher plasma galectin-3 level. Both increased myocardial fibrosis and plasma galectin-3 level recovered at least partially after adrenalectomy.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 200611031R; Results.","['Adrenalectomy', 'Aldosterone', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Galectin 3', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardium', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies']",27190071,"[['E04.270.115'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.062', 'D06.472.040.585.353.118'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['C23.550.355'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['D12.776.503.307.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
7618,Dynamics of microbial biomass and community composition after short-term water status change in Chinese paddy soils.,"Paddy soil experiences repeated anaerobic and aerobic changes during rice growth, the dramatic dynamics of soil water status accompanied by changes in redox condition and O2 availability. However, the effect of rapid water status change on soil microbial biomass and community composition is not well explored. Here, we present a comprehensive study focusing on the short-term water status change in 13 Chinese paddy soils. In order to gain a reliable way to determine soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in flooded or water-saturated soils, we also evaluated two different procedures (nitrogen bubbled and 100 °C water bath) to remove chloroform in extracts during the fumigation process. Compared to non-flooded paddy soils, the flooded paddy soils tended to have a lower microbial biomass, and this was much clearer using adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis compared to biomass measured by the fumigation method. Fungal biomass, which was indicated by both ergosterol and the PLFA 18:2ù6,9c, also decreased after short-term flooding. Changes in soil microbial community composition (determined by PLFA biomarkers) were observed after short-term flooding, but the extent varied between soils. This study indicates that the dynamics of short-term water status altered the soil microbial biomass (ATP, MBC, and total PLFA) and community composition. Finally, our results suggested that liquid fumigation combined with the nitrogen-bubbled method is the best choice for analyzing MBC concentrations in water-saturated soils.","['Bacteria', 'Biomass', 'China', 'Ergosterol', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fungi', 'Microbial Consortia', 'Oryza', 'Soil', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Water']",29147983,"[['B03'], ['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.537'], ['D10.251'], ['B01.300'], ['G06.591.750', 'G16.500.275.157.049.100.500.750', 'N06.230.124.049.100.500.500'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.616'], ['D20.721', 'G01.311.820', 'G16.500.275.815', 'N06.230.600'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.555', 'N06.850.425.300'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
23894,Kinetic model of ethopropazine interaction with horse serum butyrylcholinesterase and its docking into the active site.,"The action of a potent tricyclic cholinesterase inhibitor ethopropazine on the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine by purified horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) was investigated at 25 and 37 degrees C. The enzyme activities were measured on a stopped-flow apparatus and the analysis of experimental data was done by applying a six-parameter model for substrate hydrolysis. The model, which was introduced to explain the kinetics of Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase [Stojan et al. (1998) FEBS Lett. 440, 85-88], is defined with two dissociation constants and four rate constants and can describe both cooperative phenomena, apparent activation at low substrate concentrations and substrate inhibition by excess of substrate. For the analysis of the data in the presence of ethopropazine at two temperatures, we have enlarged the reaction scheme to allow primarily its competition with the substrate at the peripheral site, but the competition at the acylation site was not excluded. The proposed reaction scheme revealed, upon analysis, competitive effects of ethopropazine at both sites; at 25 degrees C, three enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constants could be evaluated; at 37 degrees C, only two constants could be evaluated. Although the model considers both cooperative phenomena, it appears that decreased enzyme sensitivity at higher temperature, predominantly for the ligands at the peripheral binding site, makes the determination of some expected enzyme substrate and/or inhibitor complexes technically impossible. The same reason might also account for one of the paradoxes in cholinesterases: activities at 25 degrees C at low substrate concentrations are higher than at 37 degrees C. Positioning of ethopropazine in the active-site gorge by molecular dynamics simulations shows that A328, W82, D70, and Y332 amino acid residues stabilize binding of the inhibitor.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Butyrylcholinesterase', 'Cholinergic Antagonists', 'Horses', 'Kinetics', 'Phenothiazines']",11811945,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.170.250'], ['D27.505.519.625.120.200', 'D27.505.696.577.120.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.984.235.472'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D02.886.369', 'D03.633.300.783']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45007,Sources of sampling variation in saliva cortisol in dogs.,"The main advantage of collecting saliva cortisol as opposed to plasma cortisol is that it is non-invasive and therefore it is now widely used in stress measurement studies on farm animals and dogs. Although a plasma cortisol response to handling associated with blood collection generally occurs at 3 min from the commencement of handling, there is no information in the literature on the time course of the response of salivary cortisol concentration to handling. The aims of these experiments were to (1). determine if there is a response to up to 4 min handling that affects cortisol concentration in saliva and (2). determine the main causes of variation in saliva cortisol in dogs over time. In experiment 1, saliva was collected from six Kelpies at 0 min then 2, 3 or 4 min after the commencement of restraint. There was no handling effect found in up to 4 min sampling time. In experiment 2, saliva was collected from six Labrador Retrievers five times in 2 h (14:00-16:00), three days a week for four weeks. Some of the sources of variation in saliva cortisol over time included between dog variation that varied over a period of days and variation between occasions that affected the group of dogs as a whole.","['Animals', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Male', 'Observer Variation', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Saliva', 'Specimen Handling', 'Time Factors']",12893165,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['A12.200.666'], ['E01.370.225.998', 'E05.200.998'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
34845,Role of circulating gastrin in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: A trophic role of gastrin has been convincingly demonstrated in the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach, but is still a matter of debate in the lower gastrointestinal tract.METHODS: In order to examine the role of circulating gastrin in colorectal adenoma and carcinoma fasting serum gastrin concentrations were determined in 351 patients undergoing complete colonoscopy.RESULTS: In comparison to controls (n = 145) more patients with either polyps (n = 125) or colorectal carcinoma (n = 81) have slightly increased serum gastrin concentrations, leading to an increased mean, but no change in median serum gastrin levels. In 3 patients preoperatively increased serum gastrin concentrations were normalized after surgical removal of the polyp and/or tumor, suggesting a local release of gastrin from the polyp/tumor. Gastrin concentrations do not correlate with the histopathological classification or malignant potential of adenomatous polyps.CONCLUSION: In view of these findings a significant role of circulating endogenous gastrin in human colorectal carcinogenesis seems to be unlikely.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adenoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Gastrins', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",10095150,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['C04.557.470.035'], ['C23.300.825.411.235'], ['E01.370.372.250.250.200', 'E01.370.388.250.250.250.160', 'E04.210.240.250.160', 'E04.502.250.250.250.160'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['D06.472.317.413', 'D06.472.699.280', 'D12.644.400.320', 'D12.644.548.280', 'D12.776.631.650.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670.325', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670.325', 'E05.200.500.620.670.325', 'E05.200.750.600.670.325', 'E05.393.661.475'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
151,Comparison of an auto-stereoscopic display and polarized stereoscopic projection for macroscopic pathology.,"We investigated stereoscopic imaging for gross examination in telepathology. A conventional macroscopic station was equipped with two cameras mounted 6.5 cm apart and images were produced of 30 different routine pathology specimens. Still images were displayed on a three-dimensional auto-stereoscopic display with a lenticular plate (which did not require the viewer to wear special glasses) and as a three-dimensional projection that required the viewer to wear glasses with polarized lenses. Nine observers (pathologists, laboratory technicians and engineers) viewed the three-dimensional images first on the auto-stereoscopic display and then with polarized projection. The observers scored the images for spatial reproduction, surface structure, proportions, colour and sharpness (10 indices in total, each rated on a five-point Likert scale of 1-5, with lower scores indicating better quality). Results were compared with those from five observers who had previously viewed the corresponding two-dimensional images on a conventional (two-dimensional) display. The mean scores across each of the 10 indices were 2.9 (two-dimensional display), 2.1 (auto-stereoscopic display) and 1.6 (polarized projection). All observers stated that the polarized projection had superior image quality with regard to resolution, colour and surface structures.

The constitutive expression of the mtlAFD operon in an mtlF mutant was prevented when entire mtlA or only its 3' part (EIIB(Mtl) ) were deleted. Yeast two-hybrid experiments revealed a direct interaction of the EIIB(Mtl)  domain with the two C-terminal domains of MtlR. Complementation of the Ä3'-mtlA ÄmtlF or ÄmtlAFD mutants with mtlA restored constitutive MtlR activity, whereas complementation with only 3'-mtlA had no effect. Moreover, synthesis of EIIB(Mtl)  in strains producing constitutively active MtlR caused MtlR inactivation. Interestingly, EIIB(Mtl)  fused to the trans-membrane protein YwqC restored constitutive MtlR activity in the above mutants. Replacing the phosphorylatable Cys with Asp in MtlA or soluble EIIB(Mtl)  lowered MtlR activation, indicating that MtlR does not interact with phosphorylatyed EIIB(Mtl) . Induction of the B. subtilis mtl operon therefore follows a novel regulation mechanism where the transcription activator needs to be sequestered to the membrane by unphosphorylated EIICB(Mtl)  in order to be functional.","['Bacillus subtilis', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cell Membrane', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Mannitol', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Operon', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Repressor Proteins']",23279188,"[['B03.300.390.400.158.218.725', 'B03.353.500.100.218.725', 'B03.510.100.100.218.725', 'B03.510.415.400.158.218.725', 'B03.510.460.410.158.218.725'], ['D12.776.097'], ['A11.284.149'], ['G05.308.300'], ['D02.033.800.609', 'D09.853.609'], ['D12.776.157.530', 'D12.776.543.585'], ['G05.360.340.024.686', 'G05.360.340.358.207.500'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.776.260.703', 'D12.776.930.780']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
16665,Biopsied lesions of the gingiva in a southern Indian population - a retrospective study.,"PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyse the frequency and distribution of various biopsied lesions of the gingiva among patients attending a dental teaching institution in Karnataka state in India.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collected from 153 gingival biopsies referred to the Department of Oral Pathology, Yenepoya Dental College in Mangalore, Karnataka state, India during a 5-year period from 2004-2008 were utilised for the purpose of this study. Lesions were categorised by their type and analysed for age, sex and location.RESULTS: Non-neoplastic lesions accounted for 51% while neoplastic and potentially malignant lesions accounted for 49% of the lesions. The most common non-neoplastic lesion was pyogenic granuloma (42.3%), the most common benign neoplasm was fibroma (34.5%) and the most common malignant lesion was squamous cell carcinoma (82.6%). Among all the lesions, the most common was squamous cell carcinoma (24.8% of all the lesions).CONCLUSIONS: Unlike in previous studies, squamous cell carcinoma was the most common gingival lesion. The proportion of malignant and potentially malignant lesions was also higher among subjects in the present study than in other populations. Hence, public oral health programmes need to be formulated to better tackle the burden of these diseases.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibroma', 'Gingival Diseases', 'Gingival Neoplasms', 'Granuloma, Pyogenic', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution', 'Young Adult']",23507684,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C04.557.450.565.590.340'], ['C07.465.714.258'], ['C04.588.443.591.402', 'C07.465.530.402', 'C07.465.714.258.409'], ['C23.550.382.937'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A10.615.550.599', 'A14.549.512'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['I01.240.800', 'N01.224.803', 'N06.850.505.400.850'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
27036,[Effect of Conditioning Agent Combined with Flooding Measures on Absorption and Accumulation of Cadmium in Rice].,"In order to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of flooding measures, soil conditioner, silicon mineral fertilizer and sprayed foliar fertilizer, gypsum powder, and their multiple treatments for reducing Cd accumulation in rice grown in Cd-contaminated soil. A plot experiment was conducted in three different Cd-contaminated soils. The results showed that flooding measures, a single application of conditioning agents, and combined application and flooding treatment can reduce soil-available Cd and the Cd content in various organs of rice with 6.58%-30.01% reduction in soil available-Cd and 12.64%-68.68% reduction in Cd content in brown rice, respectively. The Cd reduction decreased in the following order:comprehensive treatment (T6) > basic application of gypsum powder (T5) > base Xiangrunbang state soil conditioner (T3) > mineral silicon fertilizer and spray foliar fertilizer (T4) > flood treatment (T2). In addition, the average value of the reduction effect of the Cd content in brown rice was calculated. The five treatments in the experiment reduced the enrichment of various parts of the rice, which is a main reason for the decrease in Cd content in the brown rice. According to the field plot test, the combined application of the basic conditioning agent, mineral silicon fertilizer, and sprayed foliar fertilizer, and gypsum powder and flooding measures can be used as an effective method for Cd pollution control in Cd-contaminated cultivated rice.","['Cadmium', 'Fertilizers', 'Floods', 'Oryza', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants']",31854896,"[['D01.268.556.137', 'D01.268.956.061', 'D01.552.544.137'], ['D27.720.031.400'], ['G16.500.175.812', 'N06.230.100.230.250'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.616'], ['D20.721', 'G01.311.820', 'G16.500.275.815', 'N06.230.600'], ['D27.888.284.756']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
23295,Detection of retinoid receptors in non-neoplastic canine lymph nodes and in lymphoma.,"This study evaluated the difference in retinoid receptor expression between non-neoplastic lymph nodes and nodal lymphoma in dogs. Retinoid receptor expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 32 canine lymph nodes. The lymph nodes had been previously diagnosed as non-neoplastic (6 normal and 7 hyperplastic lymph nodes) and B- and T-cell lymphoma (19 cases). Immunohistochemistry for retinoic acid receptors and retinoid-X receptors (and their subtypes á, â, and ã) was performed in all cases. In addition, immunohistochemistry for CD3 and CD79a was performed in all lymphoma cases. Non-neoplastic lymphocytes were negative for all retinoid receptors. Retinoic acid receptor-ã was detected in 100% of B-cell lymphoma and 78% of T-cell lymphoma, while retinoid X receptor-ã was positive in 78% of T-cell lymphoma cases. When normal lymph node architecture was still present, a contrast between retinoid-negative benign cells and retinoid-positive malignant cells was clear. Retinoid receptors were expressed in neoplastic, but not in benign lymphocytes, suggesting their value for both diagnosis and treatment of canine lymphoma.","['Animals', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Lymph Nodes', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Retinoid X Receptors']",24381339,"[['B01.050'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G05.308.370'], ['A10.549.400', 'A15.382.520.604.412'], ['C04.557.386.480.150', 'C15.604.515.569.480.150', 'C20.683.515.761.480.150'], ['C04.557.386.480.750', 'C15.604.515.569.480.750', 'C20.683.515.761.480.750'], ['D12.776.826.701.500', 'D12.776.930.775.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
43604,High-Affinity Binding of Monomeric but Not Oligomeric Amyloid-â to Ganglioside GM1 Containing Nanodiscs.,"The interaction of the amyloid-â protein (Aâ) with neuronal cell membranes plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease. Aâ undergoes structural changes upon binding to ganglioside GM1 containing membranes leading to altered molecular characteristics of the protein. The physiological role of the Aâ interaction with the ganglioside GM1 is still unclear. In order to further elucidate the molecular requirements of Aâ membrane binding, we tested different nanodiscs varying in their lipid composition, regarding the charge of the headgroups as well as ganglioside GM1 concentration. Nanodiscs are excellent model membrane systems for studying protein membrane interactions, and we show here their suitability to investigate the membrane interaction of Aâ. In particular, we set out to investigate whether the binding activity of GM1 to Aâ is specific for the assembly state of Aâ and compared the binding affinities of monomeric with oligomeric Aâ. Using fluorescence titration experiments, we demonstrate high-affinity binding of Aâ(1-40) to GM1 containing nanodiscs, with dissociation constants, KD, in the range from 25 to 41 nM, in a GM1 concentration-dependent manner. Biolayer interferometry experiments confirmed the high-affinity binding of monomeric Aâ(1-40) (KD of 24 nM to 49 nM) as well as of Aâ(1-42) (KD of 30 nM) to GM1 containing nanodiscs, and no binding to phospholipid containing nanodiscs. Interestingly, and in contrast to monomeric Aâ, neither oligomeric Aâ(1-40) nor oligomeric Aâ(1-42) binds to GM1 nanodiscs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a loss of function for monomeric Aâ upon aggregation.","['Alzheimer Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Membrane', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'G(M1) Ganglioside', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Nanostructures', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Phospholipids', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization']",27933798,"[['C10.228.140.380.100', 'C10.574.945.249', 'F03.615.400.100'], ['D12.644.024', 'D12.776.049.407.249.500', 'D12.776.543.039.500'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['A11.284.149'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['D09.400.410.420.025.475.390', 'D10.390.470.025.475.390', 'D10.570.877.360.025.475.390'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D10.570.510', 'J01.637.087.500.510'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['J01.637.512'], ['D12.644.541'], ['D10.570.755'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.694']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
31577,Airway mucus in recurrent airway obstruction--short-term response to environmental challenge.,"Mucus accumulation and neutrophilic inflammation in the airways are hallmarks of heaves. Endoscopically visible mucus accumulations, however, have not been studied during exposure to dusty hay and allergens (ie, environmental challenge). We hypothesized that (1) heaves-affected horses have increased mucus accumulation compared with controls, (2) mucus accumulations increase in heaves-affected horses during environmental challenge, and (3) environmental challenge also induces neutrophilic inflammation and mucus accumulation in control horses. Mucus accumulation was graded endoscopically (mucus grades [MGs] 1-5), and airway inflammation was evaluated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology before (0 hours) and during (6, 24, 48 hours) environmental challenge. Large amounts of mucus (MG 4-5) were specific for heaves-affected horses in this study. Variation among controls was considerable, however, and intermediate grades (MG 2-3) were nonspecific, showing complete overlap between the 2 groups. Median mucus accumulations (25th, 75th percentiles) increased in heaves-affected horses from MG 2.5 (1.5, 3.5) at baseline to MG 3.5 (2.0, 4.0), 4.0 (3.0, 4.0), and 4.0 (4.0, 4.0) at 6, 24, and 48 hours, respectively. MG values did not increase in controls--overall MG 1.0 (1.0, 2.0)--even though controls also showed a moderate increase of BALF neutrophils. Mucus accumulations before and especially after exposure to dust and allergens are increased in heaves-affected horses compared with controls. Healthy controls show considerable variability in mucus accumulation but, despite an influx of neutrophils into the airways, no increase of mucus accumulation after exposure to hay dust.","['Airway Obstruction', 'Allergens', 'Animals', 'Bronchi', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Horse Diseases', 'Horses', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Male', 'Mucus', 'Recurrence', 'Respiratory Hypersensitivity']",14765737,"[['C08.618.846.185'], ['D23.050.063'], ['B01.050'], ['A04.411.125'], ['E05.927.100.500'], ['E01.370.386.105', 'E01.370.388.250.100', 'E04.502.250.100', 'E04.928.600.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C22.488'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.984.235.472'], ['N06.850.460.350.112'], ['A12.200.503'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['C08.674', 'C20.543.480.680']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
512,Screening of malignant hyperthermia susceptible families by creatine phosphokinase measurement and other clinical investigations.,"We investigated 56 families afflicted with malignant hyperpyrexia. One hundred and twenty-four individuals within these families had had an episode of malignant hyperthermia, of whom we saw seventy-two. Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was statistically higher in affected individuals and in close relatives than in normal volunteers. The magnitude of the serum CPK elevations varied significantly between families. While in some families the serum CPK was clearly elevated in affected individuals, in other families the serum CPK was normal or only moderately or inconsistently raised. In these latter families serum CPK measurement was therfore of little or no value in identifying afflicted members. The incidence of musculoskeletal abnormalities was greater in affected individuals and in close relatives than in the general population. Thus, the concomitant individual belonging to a family known to be susceptible to malignant hyperthermia was a better indicator of the MH trait than was the presence of only one of these parameters. For reasons which we do not fully understand, MHS individuals were found to require fewer anaesthetics than normal persons. The incidence of MH crises within each family fell significantly following investigation, counselling, and issuance of Medic-Alert bracelets.","['Creatine Kinase', 'Humans', 'Malignant Hyperthermia', 'Pedigree']",938964,"[['D08.811.913.696.640.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.505.700', 'C23.550.767.600'], ['E05.393.673']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This study reports on the in vitro anticancer properties of BITC against a variety of human and murine tumor cell lines by four independent methods; SRB, MTT, cell counting, and clonogenic assays. Regardless of the assay used, BITC showed promising cytotoxicity in the low micromolar range (0.86 to 9.4 microM) against four human ovarian carcinoma cell lines (SKOV-3, 41-M, CHl, CHlcisR), a human lung tumor (H-69), a murine leukemia (L-1210), and a murine plasmacytoma (PC6/sens). The L1210 cells were most sensitive. BITC administered to mice bearing the ADJ/PC6 plasmacytoma subcutaneous tumor showed toxic effects at a dose of 200 mg/kg (within 24 h of drug administration) but no reduction in tumor mass. However, the growth inhibitory properties of BITC against a range of tumor cell types warrant further in vivo anti-tumor evaluation as well as its biotechnological production.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Plasmacytoma', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",7617765,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['A11.251.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.500.375', 'D02.886.250'], ['C04.557.337.372.594', 'C04.619.531.594'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['C04.588.322.455', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705', 'C13.351.937.418.685', 'C19.344.410', 'C19.391.630.705'], ['B01.650.560'], ['C04.557.595.600', 'C20.683.515.880'], ['A11.251.860'], ['E01.370.225.500.383.910', 'E01.370.225.500.388.930', 'E05.200.500.383.910', 'E05.200.500.388.930', 'E05.242.383.910', 'E05.242.417.500', 'E05.337.550.200.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7824,Effects of acute rejection and antirejection therapy on arteries and veins from canine single lung allografts.,"Experiments were designed to compare the function of the endothelium and smooth muscle in intralobar pulmonary arteries and veins of transplanted lungs during acute rejection and after treatment of rejection. Single lung allografts were performed in dogs. Dogs were monitored for 5 days to allow good recovery from the operation and resolution of early chest radiographic changes. In group I, immunosuppression (cyclosporine A, azathioprine, and methylprednisone) was withdrawn to allow rejection, which typically occurred after 3 days. In group II, immunosuppression was reinstituted at this time during acute rejection until the chest roentgenograms again cleared (approximately after 6 days). The blood vessels were studied at this time. Rings were cut from intralobar pulmonary arteries and veins of the allotransplanted lungs and suspended for the measurement of isometric force in organ chambers. Contractions of arteries and veins to phenylephrine but not endothelin-1 were significantly reduced during acute rejection. In arteries and veins, endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin but not the calcium ionophore A23187 were reduced with rejection. Relaxations of the smooth muscle to histamine increased with rejection in both blood vessels. Relaxations to nitric oxide were reduced with rejection in veins but not arteries. Treatment of rejection reversed all responses toward those observed in arteries and veins in lungs from dogs not undergoing transplantation. These results suggest that responses of the endothelium and smooth muscle of pulmonary arteries and veins of transplanted lungs are altered similarly during rejection. Further, treatment of rejection restores function of the pulmonary blood vessels of lung allografts toward that observed in unoperated lungs.","['Animals', 'Azathioprine', 'Cyclosporine', 'Dogs', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular', 'Pulmonary Artery', 'Pulmonary Veins', 'Reference Values', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vasoconstriction', 'Vasodilation']",8642824,"[['B01.050'], ['D02.886.759.111', 'D03.633.100.759.570.090', 'D13.570.900.111'], ['D04.345.566.235.300', 'D12.644.641.235.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['E02.319.310'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['G12.875.545.328'], ['D27.505.696.477.656'], ['E04.928.600.495', 'E04.936.450.495'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.769.795.539'], ['A02.633.570.491', 'A07.015.733.500', 'A10.690.467.491'], ['A07.015.114.715'], ['A07.015.908.713'], ['E05.978.810'], ['E04.936.864'], ['G09.330.380.925'], ['G09.330.380.928']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
47085,A paradise for parasites? Seven new haemogregarine species infecting lizards from the Canary Islands.,"Oceanic islands are hotspots of biodiversity due to their high levels of endemism, with the Canary Islands being a notable example. A previous molecular study on the biogeography and host associations of haemogregarines (Apicomplexa: Adeleorina) infecting lizards from this archipelago detected seven parasite haplogroups. These haplogroups exhibited high host-specificity and geographical structure, suggesting that they might correspond to distinct biological identities. In this study, along with sequencing a longer fragment of the 18S rRNA, we further explore the distinctiveness of these parasites by analysing their morphology, effects on host erythrocytes and parasitaemia levels. These lines of evidence together with their genetics, host associations, frequency of occurrence and geographical distribution support them as different biological entities. As such, we describe seven new species: Karyolysus canariensis sp. nov., Karyolysus galloti sp. nov., Karyolysus stehlini sp. nov., Karyolysus gomerensis sp. nov., Karyolysus atlanticus sp. nov., Karyolysus tinerfensis sp. nov. and Karyolysus makariogeckonis sp. nov. These new taxa are further examples of endemic diversity in the Canarian archipelago. They also contribute to clarify the taxonomy within the Apicomplexa, a phylum estimated to have one of the lowest percentages of described species.","['Animals', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Coccidiosis', 'DNA, Protozoan', 'DNA, Ribosomal', 'Eucoccidiida', 'Haplotypes', 'Host Specificity', 'Lizards', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Spain']",30871644,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['C01.610.752.250'], ['D13.444.308.442'], ['D13.444.308.475'], ['B01.043.075.189.275'], ['G05.380.360'], ['G06.462.380', 'G16.527.200.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.833.393'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['D13.444.735.686.675'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['Z01.542.846']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
43722,Antiphospholipid syndrome in Mexican children.,"BACKGROUND: Data on pediatric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are very sparse.OBJECTIVES: To describe the main clinical characteristics, laboratory data and complications of pediatric APS patients, and to analyze the differences between primary APS and APS associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory data of 32 children at the Federico Gomez children's hospital in Mexico. Nineteen patients had SLE, 12 (37.5%) had primary APS and 1 (3%) had immune thrombocytopenic purpura. We collected information on sociodemographic variables, vaccinations, age at onset, and family history of rheumatic disease, hematological disorders, skin disorders and non-thrombotic neurological disorders. Immunological features included immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies, IgG and IgM anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anti-dsDNA and antinuclear antibodies.RESULTS: The patients included 24 females and 8 males. The most common thrombotic events were small vessel thrombosis (44%), venous thrombosis (28%) mainly deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in lower extremities, and arterial thrombosis (25%). The most common clinical non-thrombotic manifestations were hematological (53%) and neurological disorders (22%). There were no significant differences between groups with regard to the site of thrombosis, nonthrombotic clinical manifestations or laboratory features.CONCLUSIONS: There were some important differences between the clinical manifestations of APS in children compared with adults, but we found no significant differences between patients with primary and APS associated with SLE. Larger studies in Latin American APS children are necessary to determine whether there are differences between ethnic groups.","['Age of Onset', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies']",22799058,"[['N05.715.350.075.100', 'N06.850.490.250.100'], ['C20.111.197'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['M01.060.406'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.107.567.589'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
23547,STRIDER (Sildenafil TheRapy in dismal prognosis early onset fetal growth restriction): an international consortium of randomised placebo-controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: Severe, early-onset fetal growth restriction due to placental insufficiency is associated with a high risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity with long-lasting sequelae. Placental insufficiency is the result of abnormal formation and function of the placenta with inadequate remodelling of the maternal spiral arteries. There is currently no effective therapy available. Some evidence suggests sildenafil citrate may improve uteroplacental blood flow, fetal growth, and meaningful infant outcomes. The objective of the Sildenafil TheRapy In Dismal prognosis Early onset fetal growth Restriction (STRIDER) collaboration is to evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil versus placebo in achieving healthy perinatal survival through the conduct of randomised clinical trials and systematic review including individual patient data meta-analysis.METHODS: Five national/bi-national multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trials have been launched. Women with a singleton pregnancy between 18 and 30 weeks with severe fetal growth restriction of likely placental origin, and where the likelihood of perinatal death/severe morbidity is estimated to be significant are included. Participants will receive either sildenafil 25 mg or matching placebo tablets orally three times daily from recruitment to 32 weeks gestation.DISCUSSION: The STRIDER trials were conceived and designed through international collaboration. Although the individual trials have different primary outcomes for reasons of sample size and feasibility, all trials will collect a standard set of outcomes including survival without severe neonatal morbidity at time of hospital discharge. This is a summary of all the STRIDER trial protocols and provides an example of a prospectively planned international clinical research collaboration. All five individual trials will contribute to a pre-planned systematic review of the topic including individual patient data meta-analysis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONS: New Zealand and Australia: ACTRN12612000584831 .

We compared spinal and epidural anesthesia retrospectively in the operations of hip fracture in patients above the age of 85.METHODS: Two hundred and eighteen operations from April 1995 to September 2003 in our hospital were examined. Epidural anesthesia was scheduled in 94 operations, and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in 86 operations. Successful anesthetic cases of each group were compared. Blood pressure, heart rate, doses of vasopressors used were recorded before anesthesia and first and second 30-minute periods after anesthesia.RESULTS: Failed anesthetic cases in epidural anesthesia were significantly more than those in spinal anesthesia. Blood pressure in the first 30-minute period after epidural anesthesia was significantly lower than that after spinal anesthesia.CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anesthesia is preferable for the operation for hip fracture compared with epidural anesthesia, because of fewer failed cases and smaller decreases of blood pressure.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anesthesia, Epidural', 'Anesthesia, Spinal', 'Blood Pressure', 'Female', 'Geriatrics', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip Fractures', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",15966381,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E03.155.086.131'], ['E03.155.086.331'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['H02.403.355'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['C26.404.061.425', 'C26.531.750', 'C26.558.276.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

17967,Time Warping Solutions for Classifying Artifacts in EEG.,"The most common brain-computer interface (BCI) devices use electroencephalography (EEG). EEG signals are noisy owing to the presence of many artifacts, namely head movement, and facial movements like eye blinks or jaw movements. Removal of these artifacts from EEG signals is essential for the success of any downstream BCI application. These artifacts influence different sensors of the EEG. In this paper, we devise algorithms for detection and classification of artifacts. Classification of artifacts into head nod, jaw movement and eye-blink is performed using two different varieties of time warping; namely, linear time warping, and dynamic time warping. The average accuracy of 85% and 90% is obtained using the former, and the later, respectively.","['Algorithms', 'Artifacts', 'Blinking', 'Electroencephalography', 'Humans', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted']",31946874,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['E05.047'], ['G11.561.731.127', 'G14.152'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.800']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
29138,Cancer-associated genes can affect somatic intrachromosomal recombination early in carcinogenesis.,"The pKZ1 recombination mutagenesis model has provided a sensitive assay where we study somatic intrachromosomal recombination (SICR) as a mutation end-point. SICR is associated with non-homologous end-joining repair of double-strand breaks and can result in chromosomal inversions and deletions, both of which are common chromosomal aberrations identified in cancers. It has been difficult to study the effect of cancer-associated genes on chromosomal changes prior to tumour formation in vivo because of a lack of appropriate test systems. We hypothesised that cancer-associated genes play a role in formation of chromosomal aberrations and that the pKZ1 model would provide a system in which such a role could be studied in the initial steps of carcinogenesis. Transgenic tumour model mice were bred to pKZ1 mice to produce double transgenic animals. SICR inversion events were scored in mouse tissues at an early time, prior to evident tumour formation, and compared with endogenous pKZ1 SICR levels. Over-expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene resulted in a significant 2.1-fold increase in SICR in spleen. Loss of Msh2 and expression of the SV40 T antigen resulted in a significantly reduced SICR frequency (0.3 of the endogenous frequency in pKZ1 mice) in spleen and prostate respectively. Therefore SICR was affected in the case of all three cancer-associated genes studied. We hypothesise that the increase and decrease in SICR in the presence of cancer-associated genes results from incorrect repairing of double-strand breaks. The data presented here suggest that the pKZ1 model may provide a powerful tool for studying the effect of cancer-associated genes on chromosomal changes in the early stages of carcinogenesis.","['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genotype', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasms', 'Prostate', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Spleen']",15135636,"[['B01.050'], ['C23.550.210', 'G05.365.590.175'], ['C23.550.210.190', 'G05.365.590.175.190', 'G05.365.590.770.500', 'G05.558.805.500'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['G05.365.590.762.320', 'G05.558.800.320'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['D08.811.074.844.750', 'D08.811.277.040.025.292.750', 'D12.776.260.556.750', 'D12.776.624.664.700.130'], ['G05.558'], ['C04'], ['A05.360.444.575', 'A10.336.707'], ['D12.776.624.664.700'], ['D12.776.260.103.813', 'D12.776.624.664.700.189', 'D12.776.660.765', 'D12.776.930.125.813'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500.791'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.760'], ['D12.776.543.750.690.725', 'D12.776.543.750.705.852.760.505'], ['G05.728'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Multivariable transition-specific Cox models demonstrated that DM significantly increased the risk for transition from ""start-to-HCC"" (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-1.59; P < 0.001), ""start-to-death"" (aHR 2.61; 95% CI: 2.05-3.33; P < 0.001), and ""HCC-to-death"" (aHR 1.36; 95% CI 1.10-1.68; P = 0.005). The effect of liver cirrhosis on ""start-to-HCC"" and ""start-to-death"" transitions decreased over time, particularly within 2 years.CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus increased the risk of HCC development in HCV-infected patients and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with or without HCC.","['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diabetes Complications', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Female', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",27930829,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C19.246.099'], ['C18.452.394.750', 'C19.246'], ['C01.221.250.750.120', 'C01.925.440.440.120', 'C01.925.782.350.350.120', 'C06.552.380.350.120', 'C06.552.380.705.440.120'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['E05.318.740.600.800', 'G17.680.750', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
39226,Yield strength of fiber-reinforced composite posts with coronal retention.,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Currently, glass fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) posts with shank heads are only recommended for moderate coronal defects. Restoring endodontically treated teeth with large coronal defects remains a challenge, requiring posts with coronal retention and high bending resistance.PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the yield strengths of FRC posts and titanium posts (TI) with coronal retention for core foundations compared to FRC and TI posts without coronal retention.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tapered posts (ER root post system) of 4 diameters (ISO 50, 70, 90, 110), 2 lengths (tapered part: 9 and 12 mm) of identical shape, 2 materials (FRC, titanium), and 2 head designs (shank without retention (SH) and post head with horizontal retention (RET)) were evaluated (n=9). Titanium posts (TI-SH, TI-RET) served as the control. The 0.2% yield strengths (R(0.2)) of all specimens were tested in a universal testing machine. Three-way and 1-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni-Dunn's multiple comparison tests were performed (alpha=.05).RESULTS: The yield strengths of the control groups TI-RET were significantly higher for ISO 110 with a 9-mm length and for ISO 70 and 110 with a 12-mm length, compared to the respective FRC-RET posts (P<.001), whereas in all other groups, TI-RET and FRC-RET showed no significant differences. FRC-SH groups did not differ from FRC-RET groups. TI-SH showed significantly lower yield strength for ISO 70 compared to TI-RET, but significantly higher values for ISO 90 and 110 (P<.001).CONCLUSIONS: Head design of the tested FRC posts does not improve the yield strength, compared to FRC posts with a shank design. The diameter of the posts had a significant effect on the yield strengths of RET as well as SH groups.","['Composite Resins', 'Dental Prosthesis Design', 'Dental Prosthesis Retention', 'Dental Stress Analysis', 'Glass', 'Humans', 'Post and Core Technique', 'Tensile Strength', 'Titanium', 'Tooth Crown', 'Tooth, Nonvital']",19463665,"[['D05.750.716.822.308', 'D25.339.816.500', 'D25.720.716.822.308', 'J01.637.051.339.816.500', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.308'], ['E06.780.346.625', 'E06.912.145'], ['E06.780.346.687'], ['E06.308'], ['J01.637.437'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E06.780.346.250.500', 'E07.695.190.088.500'], ['G01.374.850'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800'], ['A14.549.167.900.710'], ['C07.793.237.910']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
8777,Evaluation of three behavioural economics 'nudges' on grocery and convenience store sales of promoted nutritious foods.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between three behavioural economics 'nudges' and store sales of promoted healthier foods.DESIGN: Multiple interrupted time series.SETTING: Two predominantly rural counties in central North Carolina, USA.PARTICIPANTS: Aggregated store transaction data from two grocery stores (one intervention, one control) and two convenience stores (one intervention, one control) were analysed using ANOVA to examine the association between three 'nudges' and store sales of promoted items. The nudges included: a 'cognitive fatigue' experiment, in which floor arrows guided customers to the produce sections; a 'scarcity' experiment, in which one sign in one area of the produce section portrayed a 'limited amount' message; and a 'product placement' experiment, where granola bars were moved into the candy bar aisle.RESULTS: In convenience stores, there were no significant differences between sales of the promoted items during the intervention period for any of the nudges when implemented individually. However, compared with baseline sales, implementation of all three nudges simultaneously was associated with an increase in sales during the intervention period based on proportional computations (P = 0·001), whereas no significant changes in sales were observed in the control convenience store. Among the grocery stores, there were no significant differences in sales during the intervention period for any of the nudges or the combined intervention compared with baseline sales.CONCLUSIONS: Implementing three nudges concurrently in a convenience store setting may increase sales of promoted items. However, before stores consider implementing these nudges to increase sales of nutritious foods, additional research is warranted.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Choice Behavior', 'Commerce', 'Consumer Behavior', 'Diet', 'Economics, Behavioral', 'Female', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Food Supply', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'North Carolina', 'Nutritive Value', 'Rural Population', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",31331404,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['F02.463.785.373.346'], ['J01.219'], ['F01.145.236'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['F04.096.628.286', 'N03.219.215'], ['G07.203.300', 'J02.500'], ['F01.145.407.516', 'G07.203.650.353.516'], ['J01.576.423.750'], ['I02.233.332.445', 'N02.421.726.407.579'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.107.567.875.075.475', 'Z01.107.567.875.750.530'], ['G07.203.650.660', 'J01.576.423.850.730.750', 'N06.850.601.750'], ['N01.600.725'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
12970,Levetiracetam inhibits neurotransmitter release associated with CICR.,"To define the antiepileptic mechanisms of levetiracetam (LEV), the present study determined the concentration-dependent effects of locally perfused LEV on the releases of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, l-glutamate and GABA induced by 50 mMK(+)-evoked stimulation and agonists of ryanodine receptor (RyR) and inositol-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) in the median prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using in vivo microdialysis. Local perfusion with LEV (10, 30 and 100 ìM) alone did not affect the extracellular levels of all neurotransmitters in the mPFC. The release of neurotransmitters induced by K(+)-evoked stimulation was inhibited by perfusion with LEV in a concentration-dependent manner, and those induced by agonists of RyR and IP3R were also inhibited by LEV. Specifically, the RyR-induced release was inhibited by 10 ìM LEV, whereas the IP3R-induced release was inhibited by 100 ìM LEV, but not by 10 or 30 ìM LEV. The above results suggest that LEV has little effect on the components of normal synaptic transmission but selectively inhibits transmission induced by neuronal hyperactivation. Thus, the mechanisms of the antiepileptic and neuroprotective actions of LEV seem to be mediated, at least in part, through the combination of these two inhibitory effects on depolarization-induced and CICR-associated neurotransmitter releases.","['Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Levetiracetam', 'Male', 'Microdialysis', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Piracetam', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Synaptic Transmission']",22484014,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.427.080'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.760', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.760', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.760', 'D12.776.826.179'], ['D02.065.064.432', 'D02.241.081.018.110.463', 'D03.383.773.812.362'], ['E05.196.353.500'], ['D27.505.519.625', 'D27.505.696.577'], ['D02.065.064.650', 'D02.241.081.018.110.650', 'D03.383.773.812.555'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.800', 'D12.776.210.500.800', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.800', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.800'], ['G02.111.820.850', 'G04.835.850', 'G07.265.880', 'G11.561.830']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
47824,Risk of death or acute myocardial infarction 10 years after coronary artery bypass surgery in relation to type of diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the long-term risk of death or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared with that in patients without DM after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).METHODS: National registers were used to record death or AMI occurring in 6727 patients who had CABG during 1980 to 1995. Diabetes mellitus in 856 patients (13%) was classified as type 1 (6%) or type 2 treated with insulin (29%), oral drugs (46%), or diet (19%).RESULTS: The risk of death < or = 30 days of the operation was increased in patients with insulin-treated type 2 DM (odds ratio [OR] 4.6, 95% CI 2.5-8.4) and in those on oral antidiabetic drugs (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.8), but not in diet-treated diabetic patients, compared with that in patients without diabetes. At 10 years, the relative risk of death or having an AMI was 1.8 (95% CI 1.5-2.2) in insulin-treated patients and 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.7) in patients on oral drugs. No increased risk of late death or AMI was observed in diet-treated patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes. Survival at 10 years without an AMI was 40% in insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients, 48% if on oral drugs, and 59% if diet managed, compared with 66% in nondiabetic patients.CONCLUSION: Type 2 DM requiring insulin treatment or oral antidiabetic drugs is associated with an increased early and long-term risk of death or AMI after CABG, whereas diet-treated patients have a risk similar to that in patients without diabetes.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",16923437,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.250', 'N01.224.935.698.100', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.250', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.250'], ['E04.100.376.719.332', 'E04.100.814.868.750', 'E04.928.220.520.220'], ['C18.452.394.750.124', 'C19.246.267', 'C20.111.327'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40181,Feather mites are potentially an important source of allergens for pigeon and budgerigar keepers.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies on allergy to feathers have not addressed whether organisms living on feathers (mites, lice, moulds) are a source of allergens.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether feather mites produced allergens of clinical relevance to bird keepers.METHODS: We examined serum IgE responses of 96 pigeon breeders to an extract of feather mites from pigeons (predominantly Diplaegidia columbae), using Western blotting, specific IgE assay using AlaSTAT EIA and RAST inhibition.RESULTS: Feather mites are a major source of soluble proteins derived from feathers, accounting for up to 10% of the total weight of the feather. Forty-three sera had a negative score (0) for anti-feather mite IgE, 27 were weakly positive (1-2) and 26 had strongly positive scores (3-4). Fewer pigeon breeders with scores > or = 3 were asymptomatic than those with negative scores (12 versus 40%), more had late onset symptoms (with or without early onset symptoms: 77% versus 44%) and had IgE antibody against house dust mite (89% versus 23%). Western blotting of eight sera against the extract of Diplaegidia columbae revealed 20 IgE-binding components ranging from 22 to 200 kDa. A high diversity of components was recognized by each serum: arithmetic mean 7 (range 2-14). RAST inhibition indicated feather mites had species-specific epitopes as well as ones that cross-reacted with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.CONCLUSION: Strongly-positive AlaSTAT scores to pigeon feather mite were associated with allergic symptoms of late onset in pigeon breeders. We conclude that feather mites are a major source of clinically-relevant allergens for pigeon breeders.","['Allergens', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Dermatophagoides', ""Bird Fancier's Lung"", 'Blotting, Western', 'Columbidae', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Feathers', 'Glycoproteins', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Mites', 'Parrots', 'Radioallergosorbent Test']",9117882,"[['D23.050.063'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.050.181'], ['C08.381.483.125.125', 'C08.674.055.125', 'C20.543.480.680.075.125', 'C24.125'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.165.150'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['A13.370'], ['D09.400.430', 'D12.776.395'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.312', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.312', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.312'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['B01.050.500.131.166.132.419'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.710.672'], ['E01.370.225.812.735.830', 'E05.200.812.735.830', 'E05.478.566.380.810', 'E05.478.566.639.810', 'E05.478.594.760.830', 'E05.601.470.380.810', 'E05.601.470.639.810']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5564,[Reduction of atherogenesis in an arterialized venous graft by using an external sleeve].,"The parietal thickening of a vein under hemodynamical conditions in the arterial system can be reduced when supporting the vein with a rigid external sleeve. To assess the role of thickness reduction in atherogenesis of an arterialized vein graft, a 4 mm thick external sleeve was implemented around the proximal half of a carotid-carotid vein graft in 16 New Zealand rabbits. Eleven rabbits were submitted to a hypercholesterolemic diet (HC group), while five others were submitted to a normal cholesterol diet (NC group). After eight weeks, a statistically significant difference in thickness was observed between free and sleeved segments, in the NC group with 105 +/- 9 microns versus 65 +/- 6 microns (p < 10.0001) respectively as well as in the HC group with 180 +/- 37 microns versus 99 +/- 35 microns (p < 10.0001) respectively. Studying the extent of soudanophilic lesions showed a statistically significant difference according to the use or not of an external sleeve where average extent is 68 +/- 17% in free segments versus 31 +/- 26% (p < 10.0001) is sleeved segments. The reduction in vein overfullness using an external constrictive sleeve prevents structural parietal changes in the vein and allows reducing atherogenesis of the arterialized vein graft.","['Animals', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Hypercholesterolemia', 'Rabbits', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Veins']",1345700,"[['B01.050'], ['C14.907.137.126'], ['A07.015.114.186'], ['E02.183', 'N05.715.360.330.125'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['C18.452.584.500.500.396'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['E04.936.664'], ['A07.015.908']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In the present study, we assessed the mRNA expression levels of KLK6 and KLK8 by quantitative PCR in 100 patients with advanced serous ovarian cancer FIGO stage III/IV. A pronounced correlation between KLK6 and KLK8 mRNA expression (rs = 0.636, p < 0.001) was observed, indicating coordinate expression of both peptidases. No significant associations of clinical parameters with KLK6, KLK8, and a combined score KLK6+KLK8 were found. In univariate Cox regression analysis, elevated mRNA levels of KLK6 were significantly linked with shortened overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.07, p = 0.007). While KLK8 values were not associated with patients' outcome, high KLK6+KLK8 values were significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival (HR = 1.82, p = 0.047) and showed a trend towards significance in the case of OS (HR = 1.82, p = 0.053). Strikingly, in multivariable analysis, elevated KLK6 mRNA values, apart from residual tumor mass, remained an independent predictive marker for poor OS (HR = 2.33, p = 0.005). As KLK6 mRNA and protein levels correlate, KLK6 may represent an attractive therapeutic target for potent and specific inhibitors of its enzymatic activity.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kallikreins', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Young Adult']",27483364,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['G05.308.370'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.442', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.442', 'D12.776.124.125.597', 'D23.119.597'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['C04.588.322.455', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705', 'C13.351.937.418.685', 'C19.344.410', 'C19.391.630.705'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
6375,[Test-retest reliability of a web-based colour vision test].,"BACKGROUND: Screening tests should be simple, with high acceptance, low costs and offer a high sensitivity and specificity as well as high reliability. The test-retest reliability of a web-based colour vision test was evaluated.METHOD: The results of 386 subjects, who had performed the web-based colour vision test with 25 colour plates twice (available at http://www.farbsehtest.de), were analysed from an mySQL data base. Retests were performed spontaneously, normally on the same day, or through an email newsletter with a request to repeat the test. Test-retest reliability was assessed by calculating the kappa coefficient and the corresponding confidence interval. The McNemar test was used as a complementary procedure to detect the presence of systematic differences between test results.RESULTS: The kappa coefficient rises with increasing time interval between the first test performance and the test repetition. Thus it was 0.24 when the test was repeated within one hour (confidence interval 0.07 - 0.41, n = 63), it increases to 0.83 (confidence interval 0.75 - 0.92, n = 240) in the subjects who repeated the test at the earliest after two years. While the proportion of failed tests (< 3 mistakes) in the second test performance markedly decreases when the test is repeated in the short term within one hour (p < 0.001, McNemar), we were unable to identify any systematic differences (p = 0.602) for a time interval of more than one day.CONCLUSIONS: The web-based colour vision test is a reliable screening test with good reproducible results as well under uncontrolled examination conditions. Subjects must perform the test with serious intent and should not aim at a positive test result by training or manipulation because of self-delusion. Test results are reliable if the time interval between test and retest is more than one day.","['Color Perception Tests', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Mass Screening', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Reproducibility of Results']",20602298,"[['E01.370.380.850.150'], ['E01.158', 'L01.313.500.750.100.158'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.230.110.500'], ['E01.370.500', 'E05.318.308.980.438.580', 'N02.421.726.233.443', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.580', 'N06.850.780.500'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
22269,Overactivation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors through entorhinal-hippocampal connection initiates accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in rat hippocampus after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.,"Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induces secondary damages in the hippocampus that is remote from primary ischemic regions. Tau hyperphosphorylation is an important risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Increased tau phosphorylation has been identified in ischemic cortex, but little is known regarding the changes in the hippocampus. We showed that unilateral transient MCAO induced accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and concurrent dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3â at Ser 9 in the ipsilateral hippocampus. These MCAO-induced changes were not reproduced when glutamatergic inputs from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus were transected; however, the changes were mimicked by intrahippocampal N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) administration. Inhibition of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit NR2B, but not NR2A activity in the hippocampus attenuated the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and spatial cognitive impairment in MCAO rats. Together, our data suggest that overactivation of NR2B-containing NMDARs through entorhinal-hippocampal connection plays an important role in the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus following MCAO. Glycogen synthase kinase-3â is an important protein kinase involved in NMDARs-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation. This study indicates that early inhibition of NR2B-containing NMDARs may represent a potential strategy to prevent or delay the occurrence of post-stroke dementia. Middle cerebral artery occlusion induces secondary damage in the hippocampus that is remote from primary ischemic regions. We propose that excessive activation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors through entorhinal-hippocampal connection initiated the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus, which subsequently induced cognitive deficit. This study provides new insights into the prospects of NR2B inhibition in stoke therapy.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Entorhinal Cortex', 'Functional Laterality', 'Hippocampus', 'Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate', 'tau Proteins']",25903928,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A08.186.211.180.590.750.225', 'A08.186.211.180.710.225', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.382.750.225', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.620.562', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.814.695.374', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.750.562'], ['F02.830.297.425', 'G11.561.225.425'], ['A08.186.211.180.405', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.345'], ['C10.228.140.300.150.477.200.450', 'C10.228.140.300.510.200.387', 'C10.228.140.300.775.200.200.450', 'C14.907.253.092.477.200.450', 'C14.907.253.560.200.387', 'C14.907.253.855.200.200.450', 'C23.550.513.355.250.200.450', 'C23.550.717.489.250.200.450'], ['A08.612'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.500'], ['D12.776.220.600.450.510', 'D12.776.631.560.510']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45199,In Vitro Model of Coronary Angiogenesis.,"Here, we describe an in vitro culture assay to study coronary angiogenesis. Coronary vessels feed the heart muscle and are of clinical importance. Defects in these vessels represent severe health risks such as in atherosclerosis, which can lead to myocardial infarctions and heart failures in patients. Consequently, coronary artery disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Despite its clinical importance, relatively little progress has been made on how to regenerate damaged coronary arteries. Nevertheless, recent progress has been made in understanding the cellular origin and differentiation pathways of coronary vessel development. The advent of tools and technologies that allow researchers to fluorescently label progenitor cells, follow their fate, and visualize progenies in vivo have been instrumental in understanding coronary vessel development. In vivo studies are valuable, but have limitations in terms of speed, accessibility, and flexibility in experimental design. Alternatively, accurate in vitro models of coronary angiogenesis can circumvent these limitations and allow researchers to interrogate important biological questions with speed and flexibility. The lack of appropriate in vitro model systems may have hindered the progress in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of coronary vessel growth. Here, we describe an in vitro culture system to grow coronary vessels from the sinus venosus (SV) and endocardium (Endo), the two progenitor tissues from which many of the coronary vessels arise. We also confirmed that the cultures accurately recapitulate some of the known in vivo mechanisms. For instance, we show that the angiogenic sprouts in culture from SV downregulate COUP-TFII expression similar to what is observed in vivo. In addition, we show that VEGF-A, a well-known angiogenic factor in vivo, robustly stimulates angiogenesis from both the SV and Endo cultures. Collectively, we have devised an accurate in vitro culture model to study coronary angiogenesis.","['Animals', 'COUP Transcription Factor II', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Dissection', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Heart', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Pregnancy', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A']",32225157,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.260.643.039.500', 'D12.776.260.703.200', 'D12.776.826.209.039.500', 'D12.776.930.780.750'], ['G04.152.262', 'G05.135'], ['A07.015.114.269', 'A07.015.908.194'], ['E01.370.225.998.221', 'E04.221', 'E05.200.998.221'], ['A16.254'], ['A11.284.295.310'], ['A07.541'], ['A07.541.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['G09.330.630'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E05.481.500.617'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.720', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.720', 'E05.200.500.620.760.720', 'E05.200.750.600.760.720'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The pathogenesis is still unknown and therefore the question of the right therapy is not resolved.MATERIAL: With a case report of a patient with recurrence after two arthroscopic synovectomies, PVNS is discussed against the background of the clinical, histological, and radiological features.RESULTS: We performed an open synovectomy and cystic lesions in both condyles of the femur and proximal tibia were filled with homologous and autologous cancellous bone. Three months later the patient had no pain and the bone density in the former cystic lesions was appropriate.DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis is still unknown. Diagnosis often is obtained much too late due to missing specific symptoms. PVNS occurs in local forms as well as in a diffuse growth pattern. Recurrence rates of up to 78% are very high. Besides arthroscopic and open synovectomy, the treatment with radiosynoviorthesis must be considered.

48848,The role of arginine metabolic pathway during embryogenesis and germination in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.).,"Vegetative propagation through somatic embryogenesis is critical in conifer biotechnology towards multivarietal forestry that uses elite varieties to cope with environmental and socio-economic issues. An important and still sub-optimal process during in vitro maturation of somatic embryos (SE) is the biosynthesis and deposition of storage proteins, which are rich in amino acids with high nitrogen (N) content, such as arginine. Mobilization of these N-rich proteins is essential for the germination and production of vigorous somatic seedlings. Somatic embryos accumulate lower levels of N reserves than zygotic embryos (ZE) at a similar stage of development. To understand the molecular basis for this difference, the arginine metabolic pathway has been characterized in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.). The genes involved in arginine metabolism have been identified and GFP-fusion constructs were used to locate the enzymes in different cellular compartments and clarify their metabolic roles during embryogenesis and germination. Analysis of gene expression during somatic embryo maturation revealed high levels of transcripts for genes involved in the biosynthesis and metabolic utilization of arginine. By contrast, enhanced expression levels were only observed during the last stages of maturation and germination of ZE, consistent with the adequate accumulation and mobilization of protein reserves. These results suggest that arginine metabolism is unbalanced in SE (simultaneous biosynthesis and degradation of arginine) and could explain the lower accumulation of storage proteins observed during the late stages of somatic embryogenesis.","['Arginine', 'Germination', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Pinus']",29112758,"[['D12.125.068.050', 'D12.125.095.104', 'D12.125.142.087'], ['G07.345.625.249', 'G15.357'], ['G03.493'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.625.875.777']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45978,Secular trends in occurrence of acute venous thromboembolism: the Worcester VTE study (1985-2009).,"BACKGROUND: The clinical epidemiology of venous thromboembolism has changed recently because of advances in identification, prophylaxis, and treatment. We sought to describe secular trends in the occurrence of venous thromboembolism among residents of the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan statistical area.METHODS: Population-based methods were used to monitor trends in event rates of first-time or recurrent venous thromboembolism in 5025 Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan statistical area residents who were diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism or lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis during 9 annual periods between 1985 and 2009. Medical records were reviewed by abstractors and validated by clinicians.RESULTS: Age- and sex-adjusted annual event rates for first-time venous thromboembolism increased from 73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-82) per 100,000 in 1985/1986 to 133 (CI, 122-143) in 2009, primarily because of an increase in pulmonary embolism. The rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism decreased from 39 (CI, 32-45) in 1985/1986 to 19 (CI, 15-23) in 2003, and then increased to 35 (CI, 29-40) in 2009. There was an increasing trend in using noninvasive diagnostic testing, with approximately half of tests being invasive in 1985/1986 and almost all noninvasive by 2009.CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in identification, prophylaxis, and treatment between 1985 and 2009, the annual event rate of venous thromboembolism has increased and remains high. Although these increases partially may be due to increased sensitivity of diagnostic methods, especially for pulmonary embolism, they also may imply that current prevention and treatment strategies are less than optimal.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Massachusetts', 'Middle Aged', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Population Surveillance', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Regression Analysis', 'Venous Thromboembolism', 'Venous Thrombosis']",24813864,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['N03.219.151.165', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.182', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.046'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.107.567.875.550.510'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.994.750', 'G17.820.750', 'N05.715.360.750.750.620', 'N06.850.520.830.994.750'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['C08.381.746', 'C14.907.355.350.700'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['C14.907.355.590.700'], ['C14.907.355.830.925']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
23838,Antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide in a renal cell carcinoma model.,"The aim of this study was to determine the antitumor and antiangiogenic effects of the Schisandra chinensis polysaccharides (SCP) in selected renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells and evaluate its potential mechanism of action. In vitro, endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by Caki-1 was blockaded in response to SCP treatment for 48h. In vivo, a significant tumor growth inhibition effect was observed after SCP administration for 4 weeks. Moreover, SCP treatment decreased the level of VEGF, CD31 and CD34 in RCC tumor tissues. Further analysis of the tumor inhibition mechanism indicated that the number of apoptotic tumor cells increased significantly; the expression of Bax and p53 increased; and the expression of Bcl-2 decreased dramatically in transplanted tumor tissues following SCP administration. These results indicated that the potential mechanisms involved by which SCP exerted its antitumor and antiangiogenic activity might be associated with the up-regulation of Bax and p53, downregulation of Bcl-2, as well as the reduction of VEGF, CD31 and CD34 in xenografted tumors. These findings demonstrated that the SCP is a potential antitumor agent for RCC treatment.","['Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Polysaccharides', 'Schisandra', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",24556120,"[['D27.505.696.377.077.099', 'D27.505.696.377.450.100', 'D27.505.954.248.025'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.050.301.264.035.134', 'D23.101.100.110.134'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.390', 'C04.588.945.947.535.160', 'C12.758.820.750.160', 'C12.777.419.473.160', 'C13.351.937.820.535.160', 'C13.351.968.419.473.160'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.945.947.535', 'C12.758.820.750', 'C12.777.419.473', 'C13.351.937.820.535', 'C13.351.968.419.473'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['C23.550.589.500'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.131', 'D12.776.543.550.200.131', 'D23.050.301.264.900.131', 'D23.050.301.350.131', 'D23.101.100.900.131'], ['D09.698'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.103.500.750'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845'], ['G02.111.905', 'G05.308.850', 'G07.690.773.998'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200'], ['D12.644.360.075.718.400', 'D12.776.476.075.718.400']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

26384,Activation of the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway facilitates Na+ translocation by the Na+-K+ pump in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes.,"1. The effects of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin on steady-state and transient currents generated by the Na+-K+ pump were studied in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes by means of whole-cell voltage clamp at 30 C. 2. In external solution containing 144 mM Na+ (Na+o) and 10 mM K+ (K+o), steady-state Na+-K+ pump current (Ip) activated by 5 mM pipette Na+ (Na+pip) at -20 mV was reversibly augmented by forskolin (4 microM) to 133 +/- 4 % of the control current (n = 15). The forskolin analogue 1, 9-dideoxyforskolin (10 microM), which does not activate adenylyl cyclases, did not increase Ip (n = 2). Application of the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 (10 microM) in the continued presence of forskolin reversed the forskolin-induced elevation of Ip (n = 3). 3. The forskolin effect on Ip persisted in the presence of 50 mM Na+pip which ensured that the internal Na+-binding sites of the Na+-K+ pump were nearly saturated. Under these conditions, the drug increased Ip to 142 +/- 3 % of the control Ip when the pipette free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]pip) was 0.013 nM (n = 5) and to 138 +/- 4 % of the control Ip when free [Ca2+]pip was 15 nM (n = 9). 4. In Na+-free external solution, Ip activated by 50 mM Na+pip and 1.5 mM K+o was likewise increased by forskolin but to a lesser extent than in Na+-containing medium (116 +/- 3 % of control, n = 10). 5. In order to investigate exclusively partial reactions in the Na+ limb of the pump cycle, transient pump currents under conditions of electroneutral Na+-Na+ exchange were studied. Transient pump currents elicited by voltage jumps displayed an initial peak and then decayed monoexponentially. Moved charge (Q) and the rate constant of current decay varied with membrane potential (V). The Q-V relationship followed a Boltzmann distribution characterized by the midpoint voltage (V0.5) and the maximum amount of movable charge (DeltaQmax). Forskolin (2-10 microM) shifted V0.5 to more negative values while DeltaQmax was not affected (n = 11). The effects of forskolin on transient pump currents were mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP (500 microM; n = 2) and abolished by a peptide inhibitor of PKA (PKI, 10 microM; n = 5). 6. We conclude that activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes increases Na+-K+ pump current at least in part by modulating partial reactions in the Na+ limb of the pump cycle. Under physiological conditions, the observed stimulation of the cardiac Na+-K+ pump may serve to shorten the action potential duration and to counteract the increased passive sarcolemmal Na+ and K+ fluxes during sympathetic stimulation of the heart.","['Adenylyl Cyclases', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrophysiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Isoquinolines', 'Myocardium', 'Sodium', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase', 'Sulfonamides']",10718738,"[['D08.811.520.650.200', 'D12.644.360.050', 'D12.776.476.050'], ['B01.050'], ['G03.143'], ['A11.251'], ['D02.455.849.291.300'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.150.125', 'D12.644.360.200.125', 'D12.776.476.200.125'], ['G01.358.500.249.277'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['A07.541.560'], ['D03.633.100.531'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.750', 'D12.776.157.530.450.162.780', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.880', 'D12.776.157.530.813.750', 'D12.776.543.585.450.162.800', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.890', 'D12.776.543.585.813.750'], ['D02.065.884', 'D02.886.590.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
8878,"Antimicrobial Peptides, Polymorphic Toxins, and Self-Nonself Recognition Systems in Archaea: an Untapped Armory for Intermicrobial Conflicts.","Numerous, diverse, highly variable defense and offense genetic systems are encoded in most bacterial genomes and are involved in various forms of conflict among competing microbes or their eukaryotic hosts. Here we focus on the offense and self-versus-nonself discrimination systems encoded by archaeal genomes that so far have remained largely uncharacterized and unannotated. Specifically, we analyze archaeal genomic loci encoding polymorphic and related toxin systems and ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides. Using sensitive methods for sequence comparison and the ""guilt by association"" approach, we identified such systems in 141 archaeal genomes. These toxins can be classified into four major groups based on the structure of the components involved in the toxin delivery. The toxin domains are often shared between and within each system. We revisit halocin families and substantially expand the halocin C8 family, which was identified in diverse archaeal genomes and also certain bacteria. Finally, we employ features of protein sequences and genomic locus organization characteristic of archaeocins and polymorphic toxins to identify candidates for analogous but not necessarily homologous systems among uncharacterized protein families. This work confidently predicts that more than 1,600 archaeal proteins, currently annotated as ""hypothetical"" in public databases, are components of conflict and self-versus-nonself discrimination systems.IMPORTANCE Diverse and highly variable systems involved in biological conflicts and self-versus-nonself discrimination are ubiquitous in bacteria but much less studied in archaea. We performed comprehensive comparative genomic analyses of the archaeal systems that share components with analogous bacterial systems and propose an approach to identify new systems that could be involved in these functions. We predict polymorphic toxin systems in 141 archaeal genomes and identify new, archaea-specific toxin and immunity protein families. These systems are widely represented in archaea and are predicted to play major roles in interactions between species and in intermicrobial conflicts. This work is expected to stimulate experimental research to advance the understanding of poorly characterized major aspects of archaeal biology.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Archaea', 'Archaeal Proteins', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genome, Archaeal', 'Genome, Bacterial', 'Genomics', 'Microbial Interactions', 'Toxins, Biological']",31064832,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D12.644.050', 'D12.776.543.695.054'], ['B02'], ['D12.776.090'], ['D12.776.097'], ['G05.045.250', 'G16.075.250'], ['G05.360.340.358.050'], ['G05.360.340.358.207'], ['H01.158.273.180.350', 'H01.158.273.343.350'], ['G06.550'], ['D23.946']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

20137,"Anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody treatment induces long-term, tissue-specific, immunologic hyporesponsiveness to peripheral nerve allografts.","The CD40/CD40L costimulatory pathway plays a crucial role in allograft rejection. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment as a method to induce long-term, tissue-specific, immunologic hyporesponsiveness to peripheral nerve allografts. Sciatic nerve allografts were performed from BALB/c donor mice into C57BL/6 recipients. Anti-CD40L mAb (1 mg) was administered intraperitoneally to recipient mice on postoperative days 0, 1, and 2. After a 14-, 28-, or 60-day recovery period, the mice were rechallenged with either a BALB/c cardiac or peripheral nerve allograft. Rejection was assessed by measuring the production of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-2, -4, and -5, and alloantibodies immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG. IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IgM, and IgG responses were much lower in the anti-CD40L mAb group compared with controls. Nerve allograft and nerve isograft rechallenge 60 days following the original nerve allotransplantation produced low cytokine responses, whereas cardiac allograft rechallenge produced high cytokine production, indicative of acute rejection. Short-term anti-CD40L treatment may cause long-term, tissue-specific, immunologic hyporesponsiveness. This may allow time for native axons to traverse the transplanted nerve allograft and replace the graft with autogenous peripheral nerve tissue.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cytokines', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Sciatic Nerve', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",18459087,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['D12.644.276.374.750.124', 'D12.776.395.550.185', 'D12.776.467.374.750.124', 'D12.776.543.550.198', 'D23.529.374.750.124'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['G12.875.545.328'], ['G12.875.545.340'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.574', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.574', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.574'], ['E02.319.267.530.490'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['A08.800.800.720.450.760'], ['E04.936.864']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7709,MCP-1 (CCL2) protects human neurons and astrocytes from NMDA or HIV-tat-induced apoptosis.,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated dementia is often characterized by chronic inflammation, with infected macrophage infiltration of the CNS resulting in the production of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) products, including tat, and neurotoxins that contribute to neuronal loss. In addition to their established role in leukocyte recruitment and activation, we identified an additional role for chemokines in the CNS. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2) and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were found to protect mixed cultures of human neurons and astrocytes from tat or NMDA-induced apoptosis. Neuronal and astrocytic apoptosis in these cultures was significantly inhibited by co-treatment with MCP-1 or RANTES but not IP-10. The protective effect of RANTES was blocked by antibodies to MCP-1, indicating that RANTES protection is mediated by the induction of MCP-1. The NMDA blocker, MK801, also abolished the toxic effects of both tat and NMDA. Tat or NMDA treatment of mixed cultures for 24 h resulted in increased extracellular glutamate ([Glu]e) and NMDA receptor 1 (NMDAR1) expression, potential contributors to apoptosis. Co-treatment with MCP-1 inhibited tat and NMDA-induced increases in [Glu]e and NMDAR1, and also reduced the levels and number of neurons containing intracellular tat. These data indicate that MCP-1 may play a novel role as a protective agent against the toxic effects of glutamate and tat.","['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Apoptosis', 'Astrocytes', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Chemokine CCL5', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dizocilpine Maleate', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists', 'Gene Products, tat', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Humans', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",12753088,"[['C01.221.250.875.049', 'C01.221.812.640.400.070', 'C01.778.640.400.070', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.049', 'C01.925.813.400.070', 'C10.228.140.380.070', 'C20.673.480.070', 'F03.615.400.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['A08.637.200', 'A11.650.200'], ['A11.251'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.110.990.600', 'D12.776.467.374.200.110.990.600', 'D23.125.300.110.990.600', 'D23.469.200.110.990.600', 'D23.529.374.200.110.990.500'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.110.250', 'D12.776.467.374.200.110.250', 'D23.125.300.110.250', 'D23.469.200.110.250', 'D23.529.374.200.110.250'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.181.384.380', 'D04.615.181.384.380'], ['D27.505.519.625.190.300', 'D27.505.696.577.190.300'], ['D12.776.260.755.199', 'D12.776.930.900.199', 'D12.776.964.900.750.750', 'D12.776.964.925.984.400'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.125.067.500.400', 'D12.125.119.170.400'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.500'], ['D12.776.260.755.199.500', 'D12.776.930.900.199.500', 'D12.776.964.775.562.773', 'D12.776.964.900.750.750.500', 'D12.776.964.925.984.400.500']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
12712,"Neurotrophins 3 and 4 differentially regulate NCAM, L1 and N-cadherin expression during peripheral nerve regeneration.","The addition of NT-3 (neurotrophin 3) or NT-4 to injured nerves improves their regeneration potential and may aid axon guidance. It is not well defined whether NTs (neurotrophins) influence other elements, such as the cell-adhesion molecules, which promote nerve guidance and regeneration. Using poly-3-hydroxybutyrate conduits, we applied either NT-3 or NT-4 to axotomized rat sciatic nerves and monitored nerve regeneration and cell-adhesion molecule expression. Regenerating nerves were stained with antibodies against NCAM (neural cell-adhesion molecule) and N-cadherin 2 weeks after injury and staining intensity was quantified. NCAM, N-cadherin and L1 (L1 cell-adhesion molecule) transcription was measured in the proximal and distal stumps and ipsilateral DRG (dorsal root ganglia) (fourth and fifth DRG) using RT (reverse transcriptase)-PCR. Both NT-3 and NT-4 increased NCAM and L1 transcript levels in the DRG of axotomized nerves. This is reflected in the increased NCAM expression at the proximal stump and regeneration front. Increased levels of NCAM were also observed in the distal stump. NT-4 administration increased N-cadherin levels proximal to the injury, but not distally. Following NT-3 administration, N-cadherin expression decreased in proximal and distal stumps compared with the control. In conclusion, NTs differentially alter adhesion molecule expression in regenerating nerves and transcription in the corresponding DRG, although these changes in expression do not alter NT-enhanced regeneration. Thus we propose that retrograde transport of the NTs to the DRG affects adhesion molecule transcription, reflected by protein expression in peripheral nerve axons.","['Animals', 'Cadherins', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sciatic Nerve', 'Sciatic Neuropathy']",17640175,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200.200', 'D23.050.301.350.200'], ['D12.644.276.860', 'D12.776.467.860', 'D12.776.631.600', 'D23.529.850'], ['G11.561.585', 'G16.762.611'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.250.520.578', 'D12.776.543.550.200.250.520.578', 'D23.050.301.350.250.520.578'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.250.520', 'D12.776.543.550.200.250.520', 'D23.050.301.350.250.520'], ['D12.644.276.860.775', 'D12.776.467.860.775', 'D12.776.631.600.775', 'D23.529.850.775'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['A08.800.800.720.450.760'], ['C10.668.829.500.675']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
32136,Contractile properties of rat skeletal muscles following storage at 4 degrees C.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of preservation solutions for protecting skeletal muscle function during storage at 4 degrees C. The soleus and the cutaneus trunci (CT) from the rat were stored for 2, 8 or 16 h at 4 degrees C in University of Wisconsin solution (UW), HTK-Bretschneider solution (HTK) or Krebs-Henseleit solution (KH). After storage, muscles were stimulated electrically to analyse the isometric contractile properties, such as the maximum tetanic tension (P(0)). Histological analysis was also performed. In separate experiments, the effect of the diffusion distance on muscle preservation was studied by bisecting the soleus. After 8 h of storage in UW or HTK, the contractile properties of the CT were similar to those of the control, whereas those of the soleus were reduced (P(0) values of 16% and 69% of control in UW and HTK respectively). At 16 h, the contractile properties of the CT (P(O) 28%) were again better preserved than those of the soleus (P(0) 9%). Muscle function deteriorated most after storage in KH (P(0) at 16 h: soleus, 3%; CT, 17%). The bisected soleus was equally well preserved as the CT (P(O) of bisected soleus at 8 h in UW and HTK: 86%). The functional data corresponded well with the histological data, which showed increasing muscle fibre derangement with increasing storage time. For both muscles and all solutions, the threshold stimulus current increased with increasing storage time (control, 0.1 mA; 16 h, 1.2 mA) and was strongly correlated with the deterioration in contractile properties. It is concluded that, at 4 degrees C, muscle is preserved better in UW and HTK (intracellular-like solutions) than in KH (extracellular-like solution). The soleus and CT were best protected in HTK. The diffusion distance is a critical factor for successful preservation of muscle function at 4 degrees C. The reduced function after 16 h of storage at 4 degrees C was caused by hypercontraction and necrosis of about 25% of the muscle fibres, and by deterioration of the electrical component of excitation-contraction coupling of the remaining fibres.","['Animals', 'Cryopreservation', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fatigue', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",10369793,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.160', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.160', 'E02.792.156', 'E05.200.500.620.760.160', 'E05.200.750.600.760.160', 'E05.760.156'], ['E05.723.402'], ['G11.427.494'], ['G11.427.550'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
39844,Covalent binding of quinones activates the Ah receptor in Hepa1c1c7 cells.,"Highly reactive quinone species produced by photooxidation and/or metabolic activation of mono- or bi-aromatic hydrocarbons modulate cellular homeostasis and electrophilic signal transduction pathways through the covalent modification of proteins. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but not mono- or bi-aromatic hydrocarbons, are well recognized as ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). However, quinone species produced from mono- and bi-aromatic hydrocarbons could potentially cause AhR activation. To clarify the AhR response to mono- and bi-aromatic hydrocarbon quinones, we studied Cyp1a1 (cytochrome P450 1A1) induction and AhR activation by these quinones. We detected Cyp1a1 induction during treatment with quinones in Hepa1c1c7 cells, but not their parent compounds. Nine of the twelve quinones with covalent binding capability for proteins induced Cyp1a1. Cyp1a1 induction mediated by 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ), 1,4-NQ, 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ) and tert-butyl-1,4-BQ was suppressed by a specific AhR inhibitor and was not observed in c35 cells, which do not have a functional AhR. These quinones stimulated AhR nuclear translocation and interaction with the AhR nuclear translocator. Interestingly, 1,2-NQ covalently modified AhR, which was detected by an immunoprecipitation assay using a specific antibody against 1,2-NQ, resulting in enhancement of xenobiotic responsive element (XRE)-derived luciferase activity and binding of AhR to the Cyp1a1 promoter region. While mono- and bi-aromatic hydrocarbons are generally believed to be poor ligands for AhR and hence unable to induce Cyp1a1, our study suggests that the quinones of these molecules are able to modify AhR and activate the AhR/XRE pathway, thereby inducing Cyp1a1. Since we previously reported that 1,2-NQ and tert-butyl-1,4-BQ also activate NF-E2-related factor 2, it seems likely that some of quinones are bi-functional inducers for phase-I and phase-II reaction of xenobiotics.","['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Antioxidant Response Elements', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Quinones', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",26558468,"[['G03.143.310.100', 'G03.143.700.100'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675.700.040', 'G05.360.080.689.675.700.040', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680.765.040'], ['D12.776.157.530.750.100', 'D12.776.260.103.625.500', 'D12.776.543.585.750.100', 'D12.776.930.125.625.500'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['D08.244.453.005.332', 'D08.244.453.100.500', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.010.277', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.020.500', 'D12.776.422.220.453.010.332', 'D12.776.422.220.453.100.500'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.776.260.108.737', 'D12.776.930.127.737'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D02.806'], ['D12.776.260.643.715', 'D12.776.826.209.715', 'D12.776.930.760'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The mean RBC and WBC values in Lipizzans were in the lower part of the normal range for warm-blooded horses. The mean PCV, MCV and MCH values were higher, but the mean haemoglobin concentration and MCHC values were lower than reported for other warm-blooded horses. In foals, the mean RBC, WBC, PCV, haemoglobin concentration and MCHC values were higher, whereas MCV and MCH were lower than in older animals. Results indicating a significant decrease in WBC (P < 0.01) and an increase in MCV, MCH and MCHC (P < 0.05) with increasing age are consistent with some other reports on warm-blooded horses. The age-related variations in RBC and PCV were less marked. Contrary to some reports, RBC (P < 0.01), WBC and haemoglobin concentration (P < 0.001) were higher in Lipizzan stallions than in mares, but differences in MCHC, MCH and MCV were insignificant. The specific haematological values determined in Lipizzans are presumably a result of selection and should be taken into consideration when dealing with this race of horses.","['Age Factors', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Breeding', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Horses', 'Male', 'Reference Values', 'Sex Characteristics']",12069265,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.820.150', 'G05.090'], ['E01.370.225.625', 'E05.200.625'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.984.235.472'], ['E05.978.810'], ['G08.686.815']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

9407,Multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and associated risk factors in Oromia Region of Ethiopia.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) caused by multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Oromia Region, Ethiopia.METHODS: A 6-month case-control study was performed in 2013-14. Sputum samples and standardized questionnaire data (demographics, treatment, TB contact history, underlying disease, history of imprisonment) were collected from cases with suspected MDR-TB aged ? 18 years. Sputum was processed locally in the Oromia Public Health Laboratory using standard techniques. Data from MDR-TB cases and TB-positive controls were compared using logistic regression analysis. For each factor, the association with outcome variables was estimated by calculating the odds ratio (OR) together with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI).RESULTS: Of 439 suspected MDR-TB cases, 265 had a confirmed M. tuberculosis infection, of whom 88 (33%) had laboratory-confirmed MDR-TB. Over two-thirds (65%) were between 18 and 39 years of age. On multivariate analysis, an occupation of farming, known TB contact history, alcohol use, HIV infection, previous known TB history, and previous TB treatment outcome were predictors of MDR-TB.CONCLUSIONS: The rate of MDR-TB was high among suspected cases in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia. Local MDR-TB detection capacity and local epidemiology studies are essential to detect MDR-TB and guide the use of the sparse resources to optimize MDR-TB control. If TB is suspected, the presence of any of the above factors should alert Oromia Region clinicians and public health professionals to screen for MDR-TB.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Ethiopia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant', 'Young Adult']",26327121,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['G06.099.225.812', 'G06.225.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.300.500'], ['Z01.058.290.120.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['B03.510.024.962.500.702', 'B03.510.460.400.410.552.552.702'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846.775'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
12830,Systematic investigations of peak distortions due to additives in supercritical fluid chromatography.,"The impact of eluent components added to improve separation performance in supercritical fluid chromatography was systematically, and fundamentally, investigated. The model system comprised basic pharmaceuticals as solutes and eluents containing an amine (i.e., triethylamine, diethylamine, or isopropylamine) as additive with MeOH as the co-solvent. First, an analytical-scale study was performed, systematically investigating the impact of the additives/co-solvent on solute peak shapes and retentions, using a design of experiments approach; here, the total additive concentration in the eluent ranged between 0.021 and 0.105 % (v/v) and the MeOH fraction in the eluent between 16 and 26 % (v/v). The co-solvent fraction was found to be the most efficient tool for adjusting retentions, whereas the additive fraction was the prime tool for improving column efficiency and peak analytical performance. Next, the impacts of the amine additives on the shapes of the so-called overloaded solute elution profiles were investigated. Two principal types of preparative peak deformations appeared and were investigated in depth, analyzed using computer simulation with mechanistic modeling. The first type of deformation was due to the solute eluting too close to the additive perturbation peak, resulting in severe peak deformation caused by co-elution. The second type of deformation was also due to additive-solute interactions, but here the amine additives acted as kosmotropic agents, promoting the multilayer adsorption to the stationary phase of solutes with bulkier aryl groups.","['Adsorption', 'Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid', 'Computer Simulation', 'Diethylamines', 'Ethylamines', 'Propylamines', 'Solvents']",32204879,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['E05.196.181.750'], ['L01.224.160'], ['D02.092.471.302'], ['D02.092.471'], ['D02.092.831'], ['D27.720.844']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
14364,"Further study of hepatitis C virus RNA detection in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver tissues by ligation-dependent polymerase chain reaction.","Ligation-dependent polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) is a novel, simple and sensitive PCR assay that could be useful for the molecular diagnosis of various viral infections. This assay uses two capture probes for RNA isolation and two hemiprobes for the subsequent PCR. To investigate its usefulness in the field of pathological diagnosis, further study of this new PCR technology to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was carried out in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissues and the results compared with those obtained by the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method. We analyzed routinely processed FFPE liver specimens of surgical origin from 13 anti-HCV-seropositive Japanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As a result, HCV-RNA was detected in FFPE liver specimens in 12 of the tested patients (92.3%) by the LD-PCR method without the use of reverse transcription. In contrast, HCV-RNA was detectable in eight out of 13 cases (61.5%) by the RT-PCR method. These results indicated that LD-PCR was useful for HCV-RNA detection in routinely processed FFPE liver specimens.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'Formaldehyde', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral', 'Tissue Fixation']",9702854,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['D13.444.600.223', 'D27.505.259.750.600.223', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223'], ['D02.047.407'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.620'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.440.610', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.440.610', 'E05.200.500.620.760.440.610', 'E05.200.750.600.760.440.610'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.720', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.720', 'E05.200.500.620.760.720', 'E05.200.750.600.760.720']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
6681,Feeding state influences the content of FMRFamide- and tachykinin-related peptides in endocrine-like cells of the midgut of Locusta migratoria.,"The midgut of 5th instar male African migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, was found to contain endocrine-like cells that stained positively for FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity. These cells have cell bodies which are tear-drop in shape with processes extending from the cell body. FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity has been described in similar cells in adult midgut tissue [16]. The midgut tissue content of FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity is differentially distributed throughout various regions of the midgut (gastric cecae, anterior and posterior midgut) in 5th instar and varied ages of adult. FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity in midgut tissues decreases significantly by 24 h of starvation, whereas locustatachykinin I-like immunoreactivity does not decrease until 48 h of starvation indicating that there are differential timing effects of these two peptide families on midgut content. HPLC analysis, combined with RIA, of different regions of the midgut tissue from both fed and starved locusts revealed that the relative proportions of the members of the two peptide families vary depending upon the feeding state. These results indicate that the contents of these endocrine-like cells appears to be differentially influenced by the feeding state of the locust.","['Animals', 'Eating', 'Endocrine System', 'FMRFamide', 'Grasshoppers', 'Male', 'Tachykinins']",11179816,"[['B01.050'], ['G07.203.650.283', 'G10.261.330'], ['A06'], ['D12.644.400.235', 'D12.776.631.650.235'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.678.369'], ['D12.644.276.812.900', 'D12.644.400.800', 'D12.644.456.800', 'D12.776.467.812.900', 'D12.776.631.650.800', 'D23.469.050.375.850', 'D23.529.812.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41028,Reference point insensitive molecular data analysis.,"MOTIVATION: In biomedicine, every molecular measurement is relative to a reference point, like a fixed aliquot of RNA extracted from a tissue, a defined number of blood cells, or a defined volume of biofluid. Reference points are often chosen for practical reasons. For example, we might want to assess the metabolome of a diseased organ but can only measure metabolites in blood or urine. In this case, the observable data only indirectly reflects the disease state. The statistical implications of these discrepancies in reference points have not yet been discussed.RESULTS: Here, we show that reference point discrepancies compromise the performance of regression models like the LASSO. As an alternative, we suggest zero-sum regression for a reference point insensitive analysis. We show that zero-sum regression is superior to the LASSO in case of a poor choice of reference point both in simulations and in an application that integrates intestinal microbiome analysis with metabolomics. Moreover, we describe a novel coordinate descent based algorithm to fit zero-sum elastic nets.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R-package ""zeroSum"" can be downloaded at https://github.com/rehbergT/zeroSum Moreover, we provide all R-scripts and data used to produce the results of this manuscript as Supplementary Material CONTACT: Michael.Altenbuchinger@ukr.de, Thorsten.Rehberg@ukr.de and Rainer.Spang@ukr.deSupplementary information: Supplementary material is available at Bioinformatics online.","['Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Metabolomics', 'Software']",27634945,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['B03'], ['H01.158.273.180', 'L01.313.124'], ['L01.224.160'], ['G06.591.375', 'G16.500.275.157.049.100.500.375', 'N06.230.124.049.100.500.250'], ['G05.308.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H01.158.201.586', 'H01.158.273.180.599', 'H01.181.122.638'], ['L01.224.900']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

45520,"Segment-specific retention of a larval neuromuscular system and its role in a new, rhythmic, pupal motor pattern in Manduca sexta.","At pupation in Manduca sexta, accessory planta retractor muscles and their motoneurons degenerate in segment-specific patterns. Accessory planta retractor muscles in abdominal segments 2 and 3 survive in reduced form through the pupal stage and degenerate after adult emergence. Electromyographic and electrophysiological recordings show that these accessory planta retractor muscles participate in a new, rhythmic 'pupal motor pattern' in which all four muscles contract synchronously at approximately 4 s intervals for extended bouts. Accessory planta retractor muscle contractions are driven by synaptic activation of accessory planta retractor motoneurons and are often accompanied by rhythmic activity in intersegmental muscles and spiracular closer muscles. The pupal motor pattern is influenced by descending neural input although isolated abdominal ganglia can produce a pupal motor pattern-like rhythm. The robust pupal motor pattern first seen after pupal ecdysis weakens during the second half of pupal life. Anemometric recordings indicate that the intersegmental muscle and spiracular closer muscle component of the pupal motor pattern produces ventilation. Accessory planta retractor muscle contractions lift the flexible abdominal floor, to which the developing wings and legs adhere tightly. We hypothesize that, by a bellows-like action, the accessory planta retractor muscle contractions circulate hemolymph in the appendages. Morphometric analysis shows that dendritic regression is similar in accessory planta retractor motoneurons with different pupal fates, and that accessory planta retractor motoneurons begin to participate in the pupal motor pattern while their dendrites are regressed.","['Animals', 'Dendrites', 'Electromyography', 'Electrophysiology', 'Larva', 'Manduca', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscles', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Pupa']",9763701,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.675.256', 'A11.284.180.225', 'A11.671.240'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['B05.500.500', 'G07.345.500.550.500.500'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.937.650.525'], ['A08.675.655.500', 'A11.671.655.500'], ['G07.568', 'G11.427.410'], ['A02.633', 'A10.690'], ['C23.550.737'], ['B05.500.700', 'G07.345.500.550.500.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
133,Carbofuran-induced neurochemical and neurobehavioral alterations in rats: attenuation by N-acetylcysteine.,"Carbofuran, a widely used carbamate pesticide, has been reported to cause neurotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in carbofuran neurotoxicity are not well understood. The present study was envisaged to investigate the possible role of oxidative stress in carbofuran neurotoxicity and to evaluate the protective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Acetylcholinesterase activity was significantly inhibited in all the regions of brain after carbofuran exposure (1 mg/kg body weight, orally, for 28 days). NAC, on the other hand, was found to partially restore the activity of acetylcholinesterase in carbofuran treated animals. Carbofuran exposure resulted in increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) in brain regions accompanied by decreased levels of glutathione. NAC administration to the carbofuran exposed animals lowered LPO along with partial repletion in glutathione levels. Concomitantly, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were significantly decreased after carbofuran exposure, while no significant change in the activity of glutathione-S-transferase was observed. NAC treatment to carbofuran treated rats resulted in protective effect on the activities of these enzymes. Marked impairment in the motor function was seen following carbofuran exposure, which is evident by significant decrease in the retention time of the rats on rotating rods. Cognitive deficits were also seen after carbofuran exposure as indicated by the significant decrease in active avoidance response. NAC treatment significantly improved the carbofuran-induced neurobehavioral deficits. The results clearly demonstrate that carbofuran exerts its neurotoxic effects by accentuating oxidative stress and suggest neuroprotective role of NAC in carbofuran neurotoxicity.","['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcysteine', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Carbofuran', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Drug Interactions', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Glutathione', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Rotarod Performance Test']",16307259,"[['D08.811.277.352.100.170.176'], ['D02.886.030.230.259', 'D12.125.166.230.259'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['B01.050'], ['F02.463.425.097', 'F02.463.785.373.173'], ['F01.145.113'], ['A08.186.211'], ['G02.111.150', 'G03.185'], ['D02.241.081.251.583.166'], ['D27.505.519.389.275', 'D27.505.519.625.120.300', 'D27.505.696.577.120.300'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['D27.505.519.217.500'], ['D12.644.456.448'], ['G02.111.515', 'G03.295.531.587'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['E05.017.449']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
10726,Protein oxidation in emulsified cooked burger patties with added fruit extracts: Influence on colour and texture deterioration during chill storage.,"The influence of protein oxidation, as measured by the dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) method, on colour and texture changes during chill storage (2 degrees C, 12days) of cooked burger patties was studied. Extracts from arbutus-berries (Arbutus unedoL., AU), common hawthorns (Crataegus monogynaL., CM), dog roses (Rosa caninaL., RC) and elm-leaf blackberries (Rubus ulmifoliusSchott., RU) were prepared, added to burger patties (3% of total weight) and evaluated as inhibitors of protein oxidation and colour and texture changes. Negative (no added extract, C) and positive control (added quercetin; 230mg/kg, Q) groups were also considered. The significant increase of protein carbonyls during chill storage of control burger patties reflect the intense oxidative degradation of the muscle proteins. Concomitantly, an intense loss of redness and increase of hardness was found to take place in burger patties throughout refrigerated storage. Most fruit extracts as well as Q significantly reduced the formation of protein carbonyls and inhibited colour and texture deterioration during chill storage. Likely mechanisms through which protein oxidation could play a major role on colour and texture changes during chill storage of burger patties are discussed. Amongst the extracts, RC was most suitable for use as a functional ingredient in processed meats since it enhanced oxidative stability, colour and texture properties of burger patties with no apparent drawbacks.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cold Temperature', 'Color', 'Emulsions', 'Food Preservation', 'Food Technology', 'Fruit', 'Hydrazines', 'Meat', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plant Extracts', 'Protein Carbonylation', 'Refrigeration', 'Rosa']",20416800,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['G01.906.595.272', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.300', 'G16.500.750.775.710.300', 'N06.230.300.100.725.154', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.300'], ['G01.590.540.199'], ['D20.280.260', 'D26.255.165.260'], ['J01.576.423.850.700'], ['J01.576.423.850'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['D02.442'], ['G07.203.300.600', 'J02.500.600'], ['D12.776.210.500'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600.350', 'G02.111.691.600.350', 'G03.673.690', 'G03.734.871.790.600.350', 'G05.308.670.600.350', 'G07.775.750.750'], ['E02.792.643', 'E05.760.643'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
44362,Prenatal lead exposure enhances methamphetamine sensitization in rats.,"Adult female rats were exposed to lead-free sodium acetate via gavage [0 mg (vehicle control)] or to 16 mg lead as lead acetate for 30 days prior to breeding. Following confirmation of breeding, the female animals continued to be exposed to their respective doses throughout gestation and lactation. When weaned, 16 control and 16 lead-exposed offspring were placed on regular water and food (lead-exposure was discontinued) until postnatal day (PND) 70. At this time, one-half of the control animals and one-half of the lead-treatment animals received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of the vehicle (saline) for 10 successive days and the remaining animals in each exposure conditions received daily injections of 1.0 mg/kg (+)-methamphetamine (METH) for 10 days (N=8/group). Locomotion in automated chambers was monitored daily for 45 min post-injection. Subsequently, during dose-effect testing, all animals received consecutive daily i.p. injections of 0, 1.0, 2.0, and then 4.0 mg/kg METH. The results of the experiment showed that both control and lead-exposed animals exhibited heightened locomotor activity (i.e. behavioral sensitization) to the repeated administration of 1.0 mg/kg METH. More importantly, animals developmentally (perinatally) exposed to lead showed more rapid sensitization than did their control counterparts. These data indicate that early lead exposure increases sensitivity to the locomotor-stimulating effects of METH. In contrast, identically exposed lead animals exhibit diminished METH dose-effect responding when tested in an intravenous (i.v.) self-administration paradigm [Rocha A., Valles R., Bratton G.R., Nation J.R. Developmental lead exposure alters methamphetamine self-administration in the male rat: acquisition and reinstatement.

45348,"Metabolic syndrome correlates poorly with cognitive performance in stroke-free community-dwelling older adults: a population-based, cross-sectional study in rural Ecuador.","BACKGROUND: Studies investigating a possible correlation between metabolic syndrome and cognitive decline have been inconsistent.AIMS: To determine whether metabolic syndrome or each of its components correlate with cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults in rural Ecuador.METHODS: Stroke-free Atahualpa residents aged ?60 years were identified during a door-to-door survey. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Cognition was evaluated by the use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multivariate logistic regression models estimated the association between metabolic syndrome and each of its components with cognitive performance.RESULTS: A total of 212 persons (mean age: 69.2 ± 7.2 years, 64 % women) were enrolled. Of these, 120 (57 %) had metabolic syndrome. Mean scores in the MoCA were 18.2 ± 4.6 for persons with and 19 ± 4.7 for those without metabolic syndrome. In fully adjusted logistic models, MoCA scores were not associated with metabolic syndrome (p = 0.101). After testing individual components of metabolic syndrome with the MoCA score, we found that only hypertriglyceridemia was independently associated with the MoCA score (p = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study showed a poor correlation of metabolic syndrome with cognitive performance after adjusting for relevant confounders. Of the individual components of metabolic syndrome, only hypertriglyceridemia correlated with worse cognitive performance.","['Aged', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ecuador', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Independent Living', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Middle Aged', 'Rural Population', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Triglycerides']",26142624,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['F02.463.188'], ['F03.615.250.700'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['Z01.107.757.362'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I03.050.500', 'N01.224.791.550', 'N06.850.505.400.800.550'], ['C18.452.394.968.500.570', 'C18.452.625'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N01.600.725'], ['E05.318.740', 'H01.548.832', 'N05.715.360.750', 'N06.850.520.830'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['D10.351.801']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

1818,Effects of sodium hydroxide exposure on esophageal epithelial cells in an in vitro ovine model: implications for esophagus tissue engineering.,"BACKGROUND: Esophagus tissue engineering holds promises for esophageal replacement after severe caustic injuries. The aim of this study was to determine whether viable esophageal epithelial cells could be isolated from an esophagus exposed to varying concentrations of alkali with regard to number, viability, and morphology during in vitro culture.METHODS: Ovine esophagi were exposed to phosphate-buffered saline 2.5%, 15%, or 25% sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The effect of NaOH concentrations on epithelial damage was assessed histologically. Esophageal epithelial cells were then isolated, and cell count and viability were investigated. Finally, cell number, viability, and morphology of esophageal epithelial cells were determined for 24 days of in vitro culture.RESULTS: Histologic analysis showed a progressive destruction of the epithelium proportional to increasing NaOH concentrations. Esophagi treated with phosphate-buffered saline and 2.5% NaOH showed significantly higher viable cell counts after isolation and culture in comparison with those treated with 15% to 5% NaOH.CONCLUSION: The evidence presented in this study indicates that epithelial biopsies from an esophagus exposed to low concentrations (2.5%) of NaOH will still yield large numbers of viable cells suitable for tissue engineering applications. In cases of exposure to higher concentrations (15%-25%), alternative cell sources for epithelial regeneration, such as stem cells, will be necessary for tissue engineering applications.","['Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Caustics', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Esophagus', 'Sheep', 'Sodium Hydroxide', 'Tissue Engineering']",22595564,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['D27.720.185', 'D27.888.569.185'], ['E01.370.225.500.195', 'E05.200.500.195', 'E05.242.195', 'G04.140'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['A11.436'], ['A03.556.875.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['D01.045.250.750', 'D01.248.497.158.459.475', 'D01.857.745'], ['E05.481.500.311.500', 'J01.293.069.249.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

30608,A Community Study on the Relationship of Posttraumatic Cognitions to Internalizing and Externalizing Psychopathology in Taiwanese Children and Adolescents.,"A growing number of studies indicate that posttraumatic cognitions play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the effects of posttraumatic cognitions on general psychopathology beyond PTSD remain unclear. The current study aimed to validate the Chinese version of the Child Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (CPTCI-C) and to investigate the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and psychopathology. A community sample of 285 school-aged children and adolescents (aged 9-17, 160 [56.1 %] female) reported their trauma-related cognitions on the CPTCI-C and completed measures of symptoms of PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety. Parents reported their children's internalizing and externalizing problems. We validated a revised version of the CPTCI-C based on the results of confirmatory factor analyses. The resulting evidence suggests that this revised CPTCI-C possesses good internal consistency, fair 6-week temporal stability, and good concurrent validity. In addition to significant correlations between posttraumatic cognitions and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, after controlling for age, gender, and trauma types, both the revised CPTCI-C subscale scores conveyed unique contributions to psychological distress while only the maladaptive appraisals of the trauma remained weakly associated with externalizing problems. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that maladaptive appraisals of the trauma had a direct longitudinal impact on chronic PTSD severity. No mediation effect of posttraumatic cognitions on the relationship between acute and chronic PTSD activity was observed. The implications of our findings are discussed for the specificity of posttraumatic cognitions to posttraumatic internalizing psychopathology and cognitive interventions that target negative trauma-related cognitions.","['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Problem Behavior', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Psychological Trauma', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Taiwan']",25957269,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.145.022'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.145.179'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.126.972', 'F01.145.179.750'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['F03.950.750.375'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['F03.950.750.500'], ['Z01.252.474.872', 'Z01.639.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

36325,Genetic characterization of an elite coffee germplasm assessed by gSSR  and  EST-SSR markers.,"Coffee is one of the main agrifood commodities traded  worldwide. In 2009, coffee accounted for 6.1% of the value of Brazilian  agricultural production, generating a revenue of US$6 billion. Despite the  importance of coffee production in Brazil, it is supported by a narrow genetic  base, with few accessions. Molecular differentiation and diversity of a coffee  breeding program were assessed with gSSR and EST-SSR markers. The study  comprised 24 coffee accessions according to their genetic origin: arabica accessions  (six traditional genotypes of C. arabica), resistant arabica (six leaf  rust-resistant C. arabica genotypes with introgression of H?brido de  Timor), robusta (five C. canephora genotypes), H?brido de Timor (three C.  arabica x C. canephora), triploids (three C. arabica x C.  racemosa), and racemosa (one C. racemosa). Allele and polymorphism  analysis, AMOVA, the Student t-test, Jaccard's dissimilarity  coefficient, cluster analysis, correlation of genetic distances, and  discriminant analysis, were performed. EST-SSR markers gave 25 exclusive  alleles per genetic group, while gSSR showed 47, which will be useful for  differentiating accessions and for fingerprinting varieties. The gSSR markers  detected a higher percentage of polymorphism among (35% higher on average) and  within (42.9% higher on average) the genetic groups, compared to EST-SSR  markers. The highest percentage of polymorphism within the genetic groups was  found with gSSR markers for robusta (89.2%) and for resistant arabica (39.5%).  It was possible to differentiate all genotypes including the arabica-related  accessions. Nevertheless, combined use of gSSR and EST-SSR markers is  recommended for coffee molecular characterization, because EST-SSRs can provide  complementary information.","['Alleles', 'Coffea', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Ploidies', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",22002130,"[['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.456.937.275'], ['E05.318.740.225.500.500', 'E05.393.290', 'I01.198.780.937.375', 'N04.452.910.099.750'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['G05.380'], ['G05.700'], ['G05.365.795']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
9712,Piscine orthoreovirus subtype 3 (PRV-3) causes heart inflammation in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) mediated diseases have emerged throughout salmonid aquaculture. Three PRV subtypes are currently reported as causative agents of or in association with diseases in different salmonid species. PRV-1 causes heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and is associated with jaundice syndrome in farmed chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). PRV-2 causes erythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS) in coho salmon in Japan. PRV-3 has recently been associated with a disease in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) characterized by anaemia, heart and red muscle pathology; to jaundice syndrome in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In this study, we conducted a 10-week long experimental infection trial in rainbow trout with purified PRV-3 particles to assess the causal relationship between the virus and development of heart inflammation. The monitoring the PRV-3 load in heart and spleen by RT-qPCR shows a progressive increase of viral RNA to a peak, followed by clearance without a measurable change in haematocrit. The development of characteristic cardiac histopathological findings occurred in the late phase of the trial and was associated with increased expression of CD8+, indicating cytotoxic T cell proliferation. The findings indicate that, under these experimental conditions, PRV-3 infection in rainbow trout act similarly to PRV-1 infection in Atlantic salmon with regards to immunological responses and development of heart pathology, but not in the ability to establish a persistent infection.","['Animals', 'Fish Diseases', 'Heart Diseases', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Inflammation', 'Oncorhynchus mykiss', 'Orthoreovirus', 'Reoviridae Infections']",30777130,"[['B01.050'], ['C22.362'], ['C14.280'], ['G12.450.564'], ['C23.550.470'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.817.750.825.580.600'], ['B04.820.223.719.590'], ['C01.925.782.791']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1318,Academic health centers and care of undocumented immigrants in the United States: servant leaders or uncourageous followers?,"Public dialogue and debate about the health care overhaul in the United States is centered on one contentious question: Is there a moral obligation to ensure that all people (including undocumented immigrants) within its borders have access to affordable health care? For academic health centers (AHCs), which often provide safety-net care to the uninsured, this question has moral and social implications. An estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States (80% of whom are Latino) are uninsured and currently prohibited from purchasing exchange coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, even at full cost. The authors attempt to dispel the many misconceptions and distorted assumptions surrounding the use of health services by this vulnerable population. The authors also suggest that AHCs need to recalibrate their mission to focus on social accountability as well as the ethical and humanistic practice of medicine for all people, recognizing the significance of inclusion over exclusion in making progress on population health and health care. AHCs play a crucial role, both in educational policy and as a safety-net provider, in reducing health disparities that negatively impact vulnerable populations. Better health for all is possible through better alignment, collaboration, and partnering with other AHCs and safety-net providers. Through servant leadership, AHCs can be the leaders that this change imperative demands.","['Academic Medical Centers', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Emigrants and Immigrants', 'Female', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Leadership', 'Male', 'Medically Uninsured', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act', 'Social Responsibility', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations']",24556781,"[['N02.278.020'], ['N04.590.374', 'N05.300'], ['M01.189'], ['I01.655.500.608.400.285', 'I01.880.604.825.608.400.285', 'N03.349.285', 'N03.623.500.608.428.285', 'N04.590.374.285', 'N05.300.380'], ['N03.349.380.420', 'N05.300.450'], ['N04.590.374.380', 'N05.300.493'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.609'], ['M01.385'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['N03.219.521.576.343.918', 'N03.706.615.806'], ['F01.829.500.760', 'K01.752.566.869'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['M01.965']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
3822,IL-6 increases muscle insulin sensitivity only at superphysiological levels.,"Exercise induces an increase in glucose transport in muscle. As the acute increase in glucose transport reverses, it is replaced by an increase in insulin sensitivity. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases with exercise and has been reported to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Based on this information, we hypothesized that IL-6 would result in an increase in muscle insulin sensitivity. Rat epitrochlearis and soleus muscles were incubated with 120 ng/ml IL-6. Exposure to IL-6 induced a modest acute increase in glucose transport and was followed 3.5 h later by an increase in insulin sensitivity in epitrochlearis but not soleus muscles. IL-6 also brought about an increase in AMPK phosphorylation in epitrochlearis muscles. We conclude that exposure of fast-twitch muscle to 120 ng/ml IL-6 increases insulin sensitivity by activating AMPK. However, exposure of epitrochlearis muscles to 10 ng/ml IL-6, a concentration >100-fold higher than that attained in plasma during exercise, had no effect on glucose transport or insulin sensitivity. These findings provide evidence that the increases in glucose transport and insulin sensitivity induced by IL-6 are pharmacological rather than physiological effects. We interpret our results as evidence that the increase in IL-6 during exercise does not play a role in the exercise-induced increases in muscle glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity.","['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Forelimb', 'Glucose', 'Hindlimb', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Male', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Time Factors']",17327367,"[['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.085', 'D12.644.360.062', 'D12.776.476.062'], ['B01.050'], ['G03.143'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['A13.395'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['A13.473'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.224', 'D12.776.467.374.465.202', 'D23.529.374.465.224'], ['D05.500.562', 'D08.811.600'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
26290,Pilot electromyographic studies of resting oral activity in obese and normal subjects.,"Subjects were placed alone in a room where purposeful oral activity such as eating, talking and smoking was not permitted, while activity such as pursing the lips sucking on cheeks, grimaces etc was measured by a specially designed electromyometer. This was done via electrodes attached to the peri-oral area and was recorded in a standardized fashion. In contrast to expectations, total resting activity in the obese did not differ significantly from that of normals. However, the two groups differ in that the time lapse prior to major peaking is significantly shorter in normals than in the obese. Analysis of patterns of both obese and normals suggests cyclic activity of approximately 120 min duration, and this was confirmed with a small group of ten obese subjects. The implications of these findings, in terms of previous work on oral cycles in the obese as well as implications for future research, are discussed.","['Adult', 'Cues', 'Electromyography', 'Facial Muscles', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth', 'Obesity', 'Periodicity', 'Reading', 'Stress, Psychological']",528132,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24713,Minimizing 18O/16O back-exchange in the relative quantification of ribonucleic acids.,"The use of isotopically labeled endonuclease digestion products allows for the relative quantification of ribonucleic acids (RNAs). This approach utilizes ribonucleases such as RNase T1 to mediate the incorporation of 18O onto the 3'-terminus of the endonuclease digestion product from a solution containing heavy water (H2 18O). The accuracy and precision of relative quantification are dependent on the efficiency of isotope incorporation and minimizing any possible 18O to 16O back-exchange before or during mass spectral analysis. Here, we have investigated the stability of 18O-labeled endonuclease digestion products to back-exchange. In particular, the effects of pH, temperature and presence of RNase on the back-exchange process were examined using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). We have found that back-exchange depends on the presence of the RNase--back-exchange was not observed once the enzyme was removed from the sample. With RNase present, at all pH values examined (from acidic to basic pH), back-exchange was detected at incubation above room temperature. The rates and extent of back-exchange were similar at all pH values. In contrast, back-exchange in the presence of RNase was found to be especially sensitive to incubation temperature--at temperatures below room temperature, minimal back-exchange was detected. However, back-exchange increased as the incubation temperature increased. Based on these findings, appropriate sample-handling and sample storage conditions for isotopically labeled endonuclease digestion products have been identified, and these conditions should improve the accuracy and precision of results from the relative quantification of RNAs obtained by this approach.","['Biocatalysis', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolases', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Oligoribonucleotides', 'Oxygen Isotopes', 'RNA, Bacterial', 'RNA, Transfer, Glu', 'Ribonuclease T1', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Water']",19484804,"[['G02.111.086', 'G02.130.500', 'G03.105'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G02.300'], ['D08.811.277'], ['E05.522'], ['D13.695.578.424.500'], ['D01.268.185.550.500', 'D01.362.670.300', 'D01.496.625'], ['D13.444.735.473'], ['D13.444.735.757.700.410'], ['D08.811.277.352.355.350.725', 'D08.811.277.352.700.350.725'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
5686,Pituitary and adrenal control of pancreatic endocrine function in the duck.,"Recent clinical and immunological data suggest that the classical concept of ""idiopathic autoimmune diseases"" is to be revised. In a normal population, autoimmunity reactions against thyroid gland, gastric mucosa and adrenals develop slowly with increasing age and are found more frequently in women than in men (at least so far as thyroid antibodies are concerned) as is lowering of the functional activity of T lymphocytes. Diabetes takes its place among a series of factors diminishing immunocyte reactivity, and thus enhancing the development of the autoimmunity process. This may perhaps be promoted in some way by genetic factors, perhaps those which also play a definite though as yet ill-defined role in determining the emergence of diabetes. For the present, diabetes mellitus itself must only rarely be considered a consequence of an autoimmune process and then only in certain insulin-dependent cases. By contrast, diabetes appears frequently to be an activator of autoimmune phenomena against tissues other than pancreas, namely thyroid gland, adrenals and gastric mucosa. Awareness of these associations should encourage physicians to seek latent humoral or cellular evidence of autoimmune phenomena in diabetics; this would favour the early recognition of clinically important abnormalities which may accompany the diabetes.","['Animals', 'Blood Glucose', 'Corticosterone', 'Ducks', 'Fasting', 'Glucagon', 'Glucose', 'Growth Hormone', 'Hypophysectomy', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System']",789141,"[['B01.050'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.237', 'D06.472.040.585.353.237'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.050.200', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.345'], ['F01.145.407.400', 'G07.203.650.240.587', 'G07.203.650.353.400'], ['D06.472.699.587.730.500', 'D12.644.548.586.730.500'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D06.472.699.631.525.425', 'D12.644.548.691.525.425'], ['E04.270.532', 'E04.525.400'], ['A03.734.414', 'A06.300.414'], ['A06.300.747', 'A06.688.357.750', 'A08.186.211.180.497.352.435.500', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.352.435.500', 'A08.713.357.750'], ['A06.300.747.500', 'A06.688.357.750.500', 'A08.186.211.180.497.352.435.500.500', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.352.435.500.500', 'A08.713.357.750.500'], ['A06.300.691']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24206,mDia-interacting protein acts downstream of Rho-mDia and modifies Src activation and stress fiber formation.,"The formin homology protein mDia is a Rho GTPase effector protein that participates in stress fiber formation, cytokinesis, and transcriptional activation of the serum response factor. Although the function of another effector of Rho, Rho-associated kinase, is well established, relatively little is known about the functional mechanism and the downstream targets of mDia. Our recent report of a Rho-mDia-Src-tyrosine kinase pathway suggested an important role for mDia in cell adhesion turnover. We identified a new mDia-interacting protein which is expressed ubiquitously. The new protein mainly binds to the proline-rich region of mDia through its Src homology 3 domain and also binds to Grb2 through its proline-rich domain. The protein is localized at the cell periphery and membrane ruffles and co-localizes with mDia. Co-expression of vSrc and the mDia-interacting protein induces significant morphological changes at focal contacts and activation of vSrc. Furthermore, we found that the mDia-interacting protein plays an important role in stress fiber formation induced by active mDia1. Our results suggest that this new protein regulates actin polymerization and cell adhesion turnover in the downstream portion of the Rho-mDia pathway by interacting with Grb2 and Src.","['3T3 Cells', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Formins', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proline', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Stress Fibers', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'src-Family Kinases']",11509578,"[['A11.251.210.100', 'A11.329.228.100'], ['D12.644.360.024', 'D12.776.157.057', 'D12.776.476.024'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210.172.500', 'A11.329.228.220'], ['D12.776.157'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['D05.750.078.730.333', 'D12.776.220.525.333'], ['D12.644.360.024.290', 'D12.776.157.057.041', 'D12.776.476.024.377'], ['D08.811.913.225.500'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.320', 'E05.601.470.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.360.600'], ['E01.370.225.812.735.645', 'E05.196.150.639.500', 'E05.200.812.735.645', 'E05.478.594.760.645', 'E05.478.605.492'], ['D12.125.072.401.623'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.776'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750.050.830'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['E05.393.220.870', 'E05.601.690.650', 'E05.601.870'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.800']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
7459,Self-paced saccades and saccades to oddball targets in Parkinson's disease.,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) manifest difficulty in initiation and execution of movements, particularly when movements are sequential, simultaneous or repetitive. Eye movements are particularly effective in evaluating motor impairments. We utilized a series of saccadic eye movement paradigms to explore the ability of 13 patients with mild-moderate PD and 13 age-matched healthy controls to self-pace saccades between two continuously illuminated targets, before and after an externally cued tracking period, and respond to unexpected changes in task demand. The latter was explored by measuring saccadic responses to unexpected ""oddball"" targets that appeared during a well-learned reciprocating sequence of saccades, in either the opposite direction to that expected or at twice the anticipated extent. Results indicated that all participants demonstrated a marked increase in saccade amplitudes from the externally cued saccade tracking to the self-paced saccades. Unexpectedly, this difference was magnified in PD patients. Self-paced saccades before externally cueing were also more frequent than requested in the PD group, but timing improved following external cueing. The second key finding was that while patients were able to respond to unexpected changes in target amplitude, performance was more variable (in terms of latency and accuracy) when responding to unexpected changes in target direction. Hence, beneficial effects of external cueing on the timing of self-paced saccades may be mediated through cortical regions, placing less emphasis on striatal regions known to be compromised in PD. Additionally, responding to changes in saccade direction (but not amplitude) may rely on basal ganglia circuitry.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Cues', 'Female', 'Fixation, Ocular', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neural Pathways', 'Ocular Motility Disorders', 'Orientation', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Reaction Time', 'Saccades']",16822490,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249'], ['F02.463.425.234'], ['G14.350.253'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A08.612'], ['C10.228.758', 'C10.292.562', 'C11.590'], ['F01.058.577', 'F02.830.606'], ['C10.228.140.079.862.500', 'C10.228.662.600.400', 'C10.574.928.750'], ['E05.723.729'], ['F02.808', 'G11.427.700', 'G11.561.660'], ['E05.796.817', 'F02.830.650', 'F04.669.817', 'G11.561.677'], ['G14.350.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
44174,Effects of specific fatty acid acylation of phospholipase A2 on its interfacial binding and catalysis.,"Monomeric phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from the venom of Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus (App-D49) was treated with 3-acyloxy-4-nitrobenzoic acids to acylate the epsilon-amino groups of two lysines (Lys-7 and Lys-10) in the amino terminal region. Resulting 7,10-diacylated-App-D49s, with acyl groups ranging from lauroyl to palmitoyl, spontaneously aggregated in solution. By contrast, 7,10-dioctanoyl-App-D49 existed as a monomer under the same condition. Kinetic and interfacial binding properties of diacylated enzymes indicated that they catalyzed the hydrolysis at the interface as a monomer. When compared to nonacylated App-D49, diacylated enzymes showed slightly increased activity or decreased activity toward monodispersed 1,2-dibutyryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, Triton X-100/1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine mixed micelles, and small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC). Toward densely-packed liquid-crystalline phospholipid bilayers, such as large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of POPC, however, diacylated enzymes exhibited a large increase in activity, which reacted up to 250-fold for 7,10-dilauroyl-App-D49 ((kcat/Km)app = (1.0 +/- 0.02) x 10(6) M-1 s-1). Measurements of the penetration of individual diacylated enzymes into 2-oleoyl-3-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphocholine (i.e., D-POPC) monolayers indicated that the acyl groups enhanced the interfacial binding of protein by interacting with hydrocarbon moieties of phospholipids and that these hydrophobic interactions remained effective even when the phospholipid packing density was high. Furthermore, fluorometric measurements of the binding of diacylated enzymes to polymerized vesicles of 1,2-bis[12-(lipoyloxy)dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine showed that the hydrophobic interactions increased the enzymatic activity toward LUV by accelerating the migration of enzyme molecules to vesicle surfaces. The analysis of the kinetic course of POPC LUV hydrolysis showed that diacylated enzymes as a catalyst were superior to nonacylated App-D49 in that they were not only more catalytically efficient but also able to catalyze more turnovers without being trapped in product-containing vesicles. In summary, the acylation of App-D49 by 3-acyloxy-4-nitrobenzoic acids provides a simple and convenient way of converting the enzyme into a highly active form toward densely-packed liquid-crystalline phospholipid bilayers, which might have potential industrial and biomedical applications.","['Acylation', 'Agkistrodon', 'Animals', 'Catalysis', 'Crotalid Venoms', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fatty Acids', 'Liposomes', 'Phospholipases A', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Surface Properties', 'Thermodynamics']",7918373,"[['G02.111.012', 'G02.607.063', 'G03.040'], ['B01.050.150.900.833.672.125.937.240.250'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.130'], ['D20.888.850.960.200', 'D23.946.833.850.960.200'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D10.251'], ['D25.479.517', 'D26.255.260.517', 'J01.637.051.479.517', 'J01.637.087.500.517'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.680.750'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.680.750.937'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600', 'G02.111.691.600', 'G03.734.871.790.600', 'G05.308.670.600'], ['G02.111.835'], ['G02.860'], ['G01.906']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Analogues of GM3 and GM2 ganglioside saccharidic portions where the acetyl group of NeuNAc has been replaced by a phenylacetyl (PhAc) or a propanoyl (Prop) moiety have been efficiently prepared with metabolically engineered E. coli bacteria. GM3 analogues were either obtained by chemoselective modification of biosynthetic N-acetyl-sialyllactoside (GM3 NAc) or by direct bacterial synthesis using C5-modified neuraminic acid precursors. The latter strategy proved to be very versatile as it led to an efficient synthesis of GM2 analogues. These glycomimetics were assessed against hemagglutinins and sialidases. In particular, the GM3 NPhAc displayed a binding affinity for Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) similar to that of GM3 NAc, while being resistant to hydrolysis by Vibrio cholerae (VC) neuraminidase. A preliminary study with influenza viruses also confirmed a selective inhibition of N1 neuraminidase by GM3 NPhAc, suggesting potential developments for the detection of flu viruses and for fighting them.","['Agglutinins', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hemagglutinins', 'Hydrolysis', 'Maackia', 'Metabolic Engineering', 'Neuraminic Acids', 'Neuraminidase', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Sialic Acids', 'Vibrio cholerae']",26088695,"[['D27.505.696.477.136', 'D27.505.954.502.270.232'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D27.505.696.477.136.377'], ['G02.380'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.401.581'], ['E05.393.420.526', 'E05.481.500.311.249', 'J01.293.069.249.249'], ['D02.241.081.844.562', 'D02.241.511.902.562', 'D09.067.687', 'D09.811.589'], ['D08.811.277.450.692'], ['D09.698.629'], ['D02.241.081.844.562.668', 'D02.241.511.902.562.668', 'D09.067.687.668', 'D09.811.589.668'], ['B03.440.450.900.859.225', 'B03.660.250.830.830.100']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
39158,Genetic basis of antimicrobial drug resistance in clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Hadar from a Spanish region.,"The genetic bases of antimicrobial drug resistance (R) of 79 Salmonella enterica serotype Hadar clinical isolates (recovered during 1995-2001 in a Spanish region) was investigated. The isolates showed a limited genomic variation, as demonstrated by PFGE analysis using XbaI (three profiles, S>or=0.77) and BlnI (seven profiles, S>or=0.49; with 95% of the isolates falling into two clusters, S>or=0.75). Thirteen R-profiles, ranging from susceptible to multidrug resistant, were recognized. All susceptible isolates (14%) were recovered before or during 1998, when multidrug resistance (MDR) was still uncommon (20% from 1995-1998). In later years, the percentage of MDR increased considerably (92% in 2001). Resistance to nalidixic acid, tetracycline, streptomycin and ampicillin-cefalotin, encoded by gyrA-Asp87/Asn, tet(A), strA/B, and bla (TEM) genes, respectively, were the most common, appearing together in 38% of the isolates. In all tetracycline- and streptomycin-resistant isolates, strA/B and tet(A) were chromosomally located, whereas bla (TEM) was plasmid-born. Five different bla (TEM) plasmids (pUO-ShR1 to pUO-ShR5, of about 9.4, 23, 30, 45, and 95 kb, respectively) were identified. pUO-ShR3 and pUO-ShR5 harbored additional R-genes: [dfrA1] and [acc(3)IV-strA/B], respectively. pUO-Sh2, pUO-Sh3, pUO-ShR4, and pUO-Sh5 were self-transferable, and the latter could also mobilize pUOShR1. The reported data constitute a useful background for further epidemiological studies of MDR in S. Hadar.","['Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Integrons', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Plasmids', 'Salmonella enterica']",15910235,"[['G06.099.225.812', 'G06.225.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.300.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.330.200.500'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['G05.360.600'], ['B03.440.450.425.800.200', 'B03.660.250.150.710.160']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9619,Influence of proximal side mutations on the molecular and electronic structure of cyanomet myoglobin: an 1H NMR study.,"A series of proximal side mutants of sperm whale metmyoglobin (metMb) that involves residues which provide hydrogen bonds to the axial His and heme have been prepared, and the CO binding and solution molecular and electronic structure has been investigated by 1H NMR. These include Ser92(F7), whose O gamma serves as a hydrogen-bond acceptor to the axial His ring NdeltaH and whose O gamma H serves as hydrogen-bond donor to the 7-propionate carboxylate, and His97(FG3) whose ring provides the other hydrogen-bond donor to the 7-propionate carboxylate. 2D NMR data on the S92A-metMbCN, S92P-metMbCN and H97F-metMbCN show that the distal structure is completely conserved and that proximal side structural changes are highly localized. For the S92A-metMbCN, altered dipolar contacts to the F-helix backbone show that the axial His imidazole has rotated clockwise by approximately 10 degrees relative to a stationary heme, while in H97F-metMbCN, the altered heme-E helix backbone contacts reveal that the heme has rotated counterclockwise by approximately 3 degrees relative to a conserved axial His. The pattern of axial His rotation was qualitatively predicted by energy minimization calculations. The assignments and conserved structural elements allow the determination of a set of magnetic axes whose major magnetic axis is unchanged with respect to WT and confirms that local distal, and not proximal, interactions control the orientation of the major magnetic axis and, by inference, the degree and direction of tilt of the Fe-CN from the heme normal. The rhombic magnetic axes in S92A-metMbCN are rotated approximately 10 degrees in the opposite direction from the established approximately 10 degrees rotation for the axial His ring as expected. It is shown, moreover, that the pairwise alpha-, gamma-meso vs beta-, delta-meso-H hyperfine shift differences are well predicted by the change in the location of the rhombic magnetic axes. Carbon monoxide ligation rates experience minor but systematic perturbation for the S92A substitutions which confirms an influence (albeit very small) for axial His orientation on ligand affinity.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Energy Transfer', 'Heme', 'Histidine', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Metmyoglobin', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protons', 'Spermatozoa', 'Whales']",9578585,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['D01.200.250', 'D01.362.200', 'D01.650.550.250'], ['G01.154.240', 'G02.111.255', 'G02.216'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.500.640.587', 'D03.633.400.909.500.640.587', 'D04.345.783.500.640.587', 'D23.767.727.640.587'], ['D12.125.072.329', 'D12.125.142.308'], ['G02.300'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['D12.776.422.316.940.500'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['E05.196.867.519.550'], ['D01.248.497.300.459.700', 'D01.268.406.750', 'D01.362.340.750', 'G01.249.660.500'], ['A05.360.490.890', 'A11.497.760'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.875.865']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2982,Prediction of recurrent venous thrombosis in all patients with a first venous thrombotic event: The Leiden Thrombosis Recurrence Risk Prediction model (L-TRRiP).,"BACKGROUND: Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common. Current guidelines suggest that patients with unprovoked VTE should continue anticoagulants unless they have a high bleeding risk, whereas all others can stop. Prediction models may refine this dichotomous distinction, but existing models apply only to patients with unprovoked first thrombosis. We aimed to develop a prediction model for all patients with first VTE, either provoked or unprovoked.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were used from two population-based cohorts of patients with first VTE from the Netherlands (Multiple Environment and Genetic Assessment of Risk Factors for Venous Thrombosis [MEGA] follow-up study, performed from 1994 to 2009; model derivation; n = 3,750) and from Norway (Troms? study, performed from 1999 to 2016; model validation; n = 663). Four versions of a VTE prediction model were developed: model A (clinical, laboratory, and genetic variables), model B (clinical variables and fewer laboratory markers), model C (clinical and genetic factors), and model D (clinical variables only). The outcome measure was recurrent VTE. To determine the discriminatory power, Harrell's C-statistic was calculated. A prognostic score was assessed for each patient. Kaplan-Meier plots for the observed recurrence risks were created in quintiles of the prognostic scores. For each patient, the 2-year predicted recurrence risk was calculated. Models C and D were validated in the Troms? study. During 19,201 person-years of follow-up (median duration 5.7 years) in the MEGA study, 507 recurrences occurred. Model A had the highest predictive capability, with a C-statistic of 0.73 (95% CI 0.71-0.76). The discriminative performance was somewhat lower in the other models, with C-statistics of 0.72 for model B, 0.70 for model C, and 0.69 for model D. Internal validation showed a minimal degree of optimism bias. Models C and D were externally validated, with C-statistics of 0.64 (95% CI 0.62-0.66) and 0.65 (95% CI 0.63-0.66), respectively. According to model C, in 2,592 patients with provoked first events, 367 (15%) patients had a predicted 2-year risk of >10%, whereas in 1,082 patients whose first event was unprovoked, 484 (45%) had a predicted 2-year risk of <10%. A limitation of both cohorts is that laboratory measurements were missing in a substantial proportion of patients, which therefore were imputed.CONCLUSIONS: The prediction model we propose applies to patients with provoked or unprovoked first VTE-except for patients with (a history of) cancer-allows refined risk stratification, and is easily usable. For optimal individualized treatment, a management study in which bleeding risks are also taken into account is necessary.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulants', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Norway', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Venous Thrombosis', 'Young Adult']",31603898,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['D27.505.954.502.119'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C23.550.414'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['Z01.542.816.374'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E01.789'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C14.907.355.830.925'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
37723,COSTS OF DEPRESSION FROM CLAIMS DATA FOR MEDICARE RECIPIENTS IN A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE.,"BACKGROUND: Many persons with depressive disorder are not treated and associated costs are not recorded.AIMS OF THE STUDY: To determine whether major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with higher medical cost among Medicare recipients.METHODS: Four waves of the Baltimore-Epidemiologic Catchment Area (Baltimore ECA) Study conducted between 1981 and 2004 were linked to Medicare claims data for the years 1999 to 2004 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Generalized linear models specified with a gamma distribution and log link function were used to examine direct medical care costs associated with MDD.RESULTS: Medicare recipients with no history of MDD in either the ECA or CMS data had mean six-year medical costs of US $40,670, compared to $87,445 for Medicare recipients with MDD as recorded in CMS data and $43,583 for those with MDD as recorded in Baltimore-ECA data. Multivariable regressions found that compared to Medicare recipients with no history of depression, those with depression identified in the CMS data had significantly higher medical costs; about 1.87 times (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 2.67) higher. Medicare recipients with a history of depression identified in the ECA data were no more likely to have higher costs than were Medicare recipients with no history of depression (relative ratio 1.33, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.02).DISCUSSION: Medicare recipients with a history of depression identified in claims data had significantly higher medical costs than recipients with no history of depression. However, no significant differences were found between Medicare recipients with depression in the community-based Baltimore ECA data and those with no history of depression. The results show that the source of diagnosis, in treatment versus survey data, produces differences in results as regards costs.LIMITATIONS: This study involved only Medicare recipients with claims data over the six years 1999 to 2004. Many of the ECA respondents were too young to qualify for Medicare.IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY: Depressive disorder involves substantial medical care costs. The findings provide information on the economic burden of depression, an important but often omitted dimension and perspective of the burden of mental illnesses.","['Aged', 'Baltimore', 'Catchment Area, Health', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'United States']",27483975,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['Z01.107.567.875.500.500.100', 'Z01.433.100'], ['N01.224.791.200', 'N03.349.650.095', 'N06.850.505.400.800.200'], ['F03.600.300.375'], ['N03.219.151.400', 'N05.300.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N03.219.521.576.215'], ['N03.219.521.346.506.564.663', 'N03.219.521.576.343.840', 'N03.706.615.696'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

16965,Hepatocellular carcinoma complicating autoimmune hepatitis: role of hepatitis C virus.,"The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in autoimmune hepatitis is low, even in patients with long-standing cirrhosis. Because of the increasing recognition of an association of hepatitis C virus (HCV) with autoimmune hepatitis, at least in some geographical areas, and with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (hepatoma), we have examined eight cases (4 male, 4 female) who presented between 1985 and 1993 with hepatoma complicating autoimmune hepatitis. All had steroid-responsive autoimmune hepatitis with serum anti-smooth muscle and anti-nuclear autoantibodies. Median duration of disease was 17.1 years, and all patients had biopsy-proven cirrhosis. One patient had a history of intravenous drug abuse, and four had previously received blood transfusions. Serum samples (stored at -20 degrees C from up to 9 years before diagnosis of hepatoma) were tested for anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies by a second-third-generation assay and for HCV RNA by the polymerase chain reaction method using primers from the 5'noncoding region. Tissue from liver adjacent to tumor areas was subjected to polymerase chain reaction along with tissue from previous liver biopsy specimens (taken up to 19 years before diagnosis of hepatoma) in all patients. Six patients had evidence of HCV infection: four seropositive for HCV RNA (two of whom were also anti-HCV positive) and two seronegative for HCV RNA and anti-HCV but with HCV RNA in liver tissue at presentation with hepatoma. Retrospective testing showed probable acquisition of HCV through blood transfusion in the four transfused patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis Antibodies', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Probes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Viral']",7657274,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C20.111'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['A12.207.152', 'A15.145'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['C06.552.380'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254.450', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254.450', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.620'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D27.505.259.750', 'D27.720.470.530'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D13.444.735.828']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
46778,A model for computer simulation of P-glycoprotein and transmembrane delta pH-mediated anthracycline transport in multidrug-resistant tumor cells.,"Anthracycline resistance in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells is due in part to a reduced cellular drug accumulation. Using a simple kinetic model and numerical computer simulations, we have analyzed mathematically the following possible mechanisms controlling fluxes of the membrane permeable anthracyclines in MDR cells: (1) active outward transport via a specific drug transporter (P-glycoprotein), (2) exocytotic drug export via the endosomal vesicle system, and (3) pH-gradients across the plasma membrane. Model calculations were based on morphometric and kinetic data previously presented in the literature for daunorubicin transport in wild-type Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (EHR2) and the corresponding daunorubicin (DNR)-resistant cell line EHR2/DNR+. The results confirm the possible importance of the cell-surface pH in controlling DNR accumulation in the cells. With P-glycoprotein as the main efflux pump, a catalytic constant of the protein greater than 40 mol DNR transported/mol protein per min is predicted by the model calculations. Changes in the drug binding affinity of P-glycoprotein (Km = 10(-9)-10(-6) M) is of little importance in influencing its effectiveness to reduce DNR accumulation, which could explain the broad substrate specificity of the MDR efflux pump system. The conditions to evaluate unidirectional fluxes of DNR across the plasma membrane in cells with active P-glycoprotein are defined. An efflux mechanism which relies solely on pH-dependent drug trapping in a pH 5 endosomal compartment by a simple diffusion process followed by exocytosis, appears inadequate to account for the high rate of DNR efflux in EHR2/DNR+ cells.","['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Biological Transport', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane', 'Computer Simulation', 'Daunorubicin', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins']",2242381,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248.106'], ['G03.143'], ['C04.557.470.200.200', 'C04.619.169'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A11.284.149'], ['L01.224.160'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200', 'D04.615.562.050.200', 'D09.408.051.059.200'], ['G07.690.773.984'], ['G02.300'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['H01.548'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['D12.776.624']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
3288,Cytoskeleton of human mononuclear cells as a possible peripheral marker for phenylalanine neurotoxicity in PKU.,"In this work we tested human mononuclear cells as a peripheral marker to study neurotoxicity of phenylalanine (Phe). Slices of cerebral cortex of rats or human mononuclear cells were incubated with different concentrations of Phe and/or Ala in the presence of 32P-orthophosphate, the cytoskeletal fraction was extracted, and the radioactivity incorporated into intermediate filament proteins was measured. Our results show that 2 mM Phe as well as 1 mM Ala are effective in increasing the 32P in vitro incorporation into IFs in both tissues. When cerebral cortex slices or mononuclear cells were incubated with different concentrations of Phe and/or Ala, the effects on the 32P in vitro incorporation into IF proteins was compatible with an antagonistic mechanism of action of the two amino acids on the enzymes of the phosphorylating system. In addition, these blood cells may be a possible peripheral marker to study neurotoxicity of Phe in patients with PKU.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Monocytes', 'Phenylalanine', 'Phenylketonurias', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",12515306,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.101'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['A11.118.637.555.652', 'A11.148.580', 'A11.627.624', 'A11.733.547', 'A15.145.229.637.555.652', 'A15.378.316.580', 'A15.382.490.555.652', 'A15.382.670.547', 'A15.382.680.547'], ['D12.125.072.050.685', 'D12.125.142.666'], ['C10.228.140.163.100.687', 'C16.320.565.100.766', 'C16.320.565.189.687', 'C18.452.132.100.687', 'C18.452.648.100.766', 'C18.452.648.189.687'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
46073,Assessing risk of falling in older adults.,"Falls by older people present serious problems in every society. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of a checklist in estimation and reduction of the risk for falls for older adults in Taiwan. Following literature review, a purposive sample was used in a cross-sectional design to assess risk factors using a checklist. Older adults (N = 103) were recruited from three sheltered housing projects (elderly apartments in Taipei County); 52 individuals had fallen within the past year.

11129,Organization and evolution of a gene cluster for human immunoglobulin variable regions of the kappa type.,"An 80,000 base-pair region from the gene locus encoding the variable regions of the human immunoglobulins of the kappa type (V kappa genes) was cloned and analysed. The region comprises five V kappa sequences of subgroup I and one interspersed V kappa pseudogene of subgroup II. The six genes and pseudogenes are arranged at different distances but in the same orientation. The organization of the cluster can be explained by a series of amplification steps; the existence of a V kappa II pseudogene in a V kappa I gene cluster may have been the result of a transposition event; a final duplication step led to a second closely related copy of the cluster. From sequence data for altogether 16,000 base-pairs it appears that gene conversion-like events and subsequent selection contribute to both homogeneity and diversity of the V kappa repertoire.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibody Diversity', 'Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains']",6086934,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G05.365.036', 'G12.500.199'], ['G02.111.080'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.045', 'G16.075'], ['E05.393.183'], ['D08.811.150.280', 'D08.811.277.352.335.350.300', 'D08.811.277.352.355.325.300'], ['G05.308.250', 'G05.365.590.310', 'G05.558.315'], ['G05.360.340.024.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.705.750', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.750', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.750'], ['D12.644.541.500.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.797', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.790.651.797', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650.500', 'D12.776.377.715.548.797', 'G02.111.570.060.425'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.705.750.530', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.750.530', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.750.530']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

11270,United States Travelers' Concern about Zika Infection and Willingness to Receive a Hypothetical Zika Vaccine.,"The ongoing Zika pandemic has affected many countries that are common travel destinations. We assessed the willingness to receive a prophylactic Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccine, currently under development, among travelers to areas with reported autochthonous ZIKV transmission. We surveyed United States (U.S.) residents aged 18-44 years who had ever heard of ZIKV and planned to travel to Florida and/or Texas (N = 420) or a U.S. territory or foreign country (N = 415) in 2017, using a nationally representative internet panel. Travelers to Florida and/or Texas reported less concern about ZIKV infection than travelers to other destinations (27% versus 36%, P = 0.01). Female sex, Hispanic ethnicity, discussing ZIKV with medical professionals, ZIKV risk perception, and self-efficacy for ZIKV prevention predicted concern about ZIKV infection in both groups. Travelers to Florida and/or Texas (43%) and other destinations (44%) were equally willing to receive a ZIKV vaccine. Hispanic ethnicity, discussing ZIKV with medical professionals, and concern about ZIKV infection predicted vaccine willingness in both groups. Likelihood of using existing ZIKV prevention methods, confidence in the U.S. government to prevent ZIKV spread, self-efficacy for ZIKV prevention, and knowledge about ZIKV symptoms further predicted vaccine willingness in travelers to other destinations. In multivariable analyses, only concern about ZIKV infection was associated with vaccine willingness in both groups (prevalence ratio [95% confidence interval]: Florida and/or Texas: 1.34 [1.06, 1.69]; other: 1.82 [1.44, 2.29]). Targeted communications can educate travelers, particularly travelers who are pregnant or may become pregnant, about ZIKV risk to generate ZIKV vaccine demand.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Florida', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Pregnancy', 'Texas', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Young Adult', 'Zika Virus', 'Zika Virus Infection']",29692314,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['Z01.107.567.875.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['E01.370.500', 'E05.318.308.980.438.580', 'N02.421.726.233.443', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.580', 'N06.850.780.500'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['Z01.107.567.875.760.750'], ['I03.883'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.530.890', 'E05.478.550.600.890', 'N02.421.726.758.310.890', 'N06.850.780.200.425.900', 'N06.850.780.680.310.890'], ['D20.215.894.899'], ['M01.060.116.815'], ['B04.820.578.344.350.995'], ['C01.920.500.990', 'C01.925.081.990', 'C01.925.782.350.250.990']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6174,Bezafibrate induces acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA levels and fatty acid peroxisomal beta-oxidation in rat white adipose tissue.,"Rats treated with bezafibrate, a PPAR activator, gain less body weight and increase daily food intake. Previously, we have related these changes to a shift of thermogenesis from brown adipose tissue to white adipose tissue attributable to bezafibrate, which induces uncoupling proteins (UCP), UCP-1 and UCP-3, in rat white adipocytes. Nevertheless, UCP induction was weak, implying additional mechanisms in the change of energy homeostasis produced by bezafibrate. Here we show that bezafibrate, in addition to inducing UCPs, modifies energy homeostasis by directly inducing aco gene expression and peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation in white adipose tissue. Further, bezafibrate significantly reduced plasma triglyceride and leptin concentrations, without modifying the levels of PPARgamma or ob gene in white adipose tissue. These results indicate that bezafibrate reduces the amount of fatty acids available for triglyceride synthesis in white adipose tissue.","['Acyl-CoA Oxidase', 'Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Bezafibrate', 'Body Weight', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol', 'Fatty Acids', 'Hypolipidemic Agents', 'Leptin', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Oxidoreductases', 'Oxygen', 'Peroxisomes', 'RNA', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors', 'Triglycerides']",11216866,"[['D08.811.682.660.150.200', 'D12.776.331.149'], ['A10.165.114'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.065.277.067', 'D02.241.081.114.968.500.249', 'D02.241.223.100.100.120', 'D02.241.223.100.200.249', 'D02.355.726.305.249', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.085.101', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.250.249', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.654.305.249'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['A11.251'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197', 'D10.570.938.208'], ['D10.251'], ['D27.505.519.186.071', 'D27.505.954.557.500'], ['D06.472.699.042.500', 'D12.644.276.024.500', 'D12.644.548.011.500', 'D12.776.467.024.500', 'D23.529.024.500'], ['A03.620'], ['D08.811.682'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.500.585.600', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.190.755.600'], ['D13.444.735'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.826'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D12.776.930'], ['D10.351.801']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
42074,The objective evaluation of the severity of psoriatic scales with desquamation collecting tapes and image analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Assessment of psoriatic scales is important to determine the severity of psoriasis. However, there are very limited numbers of objective, quantitative and observer-independent tools for measuring the severity of psoriasis.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the bioengineering parameters of the psoriatic scale can be used to assess the severity of psoriasis instead of the psoriatic severity index of scales (PSIs) score.METHODS: Thirty-four patients with psoriasis were included. A representative lesion from each patient was selected and bioengineering parameters were measured using the Corneofix(®). Simultaneously, the severity of the scales was assessed by the PSIs score using clinical photographs of the lesions. In addition, skin color and elasticity parameters were also measured using the Colorimeter(®), the Mexameter(®) and the Cutometer(®).RESULTS: Statistical differences in the scale parameters were observed between the PSIs 2 and 3 scores. Among the scale parameters, the percent area and area in ìm(2) were negatively correlated with the PSIs score. In addition, the Colorimeter(®) a, b parameters and the Cutometer(®) R9 parameters were significantly correlated with the PSIs score.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that the severity of psoriatic scales could be measured objectively using the Corneofix(®).","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bioengineering', 'Child', 'Colorimetry', 'Dermoscopy', 'Elasticity Imaging Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Photography', 'Psoriasis', 'Reference Standards', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Surgical Tape', 'Young Adult']",21507073,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['J01.293.069'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E05.196.922.250'], ['E01.370.350.515.277.250', 'E05.595.185.250'], ['E01.370.350.850.270'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.600', 'E05.712'], ['C17.800.859.675'], ['E05.978.808'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E07.858.690.800'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
13602,Microbial Disruption Indices to Detect Colonization With Multidrug-Resistant Organisms.,"OBJECTIVE To characterize the microbial disruption indices of hospitalized patients to predict colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). DESIGN A cross-sectional survey of the fecal microbiome was conducted in a tertiary referral, acute-care hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS The study population consisted of adult patients hospitalized in general medical/surgical wards. METHODS Rectal swabs were obtained from patients within 48 hours of hospital admission and screened for MDRO colonization using conventional culture techniques. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to assess the fecal microbiome. Microbial diversity and composition, as well as the functional potential of the microbial communities present in fecal samples, were compared between patients with and without MDRO colonization. RESULTS A total of 44 patients were included in the study, of whom 11 (25%) were colonized with at least 1 MDRO. Reduced microbial diversity and high abundance of metabolic pathways associated with multidrug-resistance mechanisms characterized the fecal microbiome of patients colonized with MDRO at hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that microbial disruption indices may be key to predicting MDRO colonization and could provide novel infection control approaches.

For strains efficiently degrading cellulose, a highest enzyme activity was confirmed using filter paper test, and it resulted in a range from 1.01 to 7.15 FPU/ml. Based on morphological and molecular analysis, the isolates were identified as Trichoderma. The most frequently identified strains belonged to Trichoderma harzianum species. Among all strains, the most effective in degradation of cellulose and xylose was T. harzianum and T. virens, especially those isolated from forest wood, forest soil or garden and mushroom compost. The results of this work confirmed that numerous strains from the Trichoderma species have high cellulose and xylan degradation potential and could be useful for lignocellulose biomass conversion e.g. for biofuel production.","['Biomass', 'Cellulase', 'Cellulose', 'Ecosystem', 'Lignin', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Temperature', 'Trichoderma', 'Wood', 'Xylans']",30015456,"[['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['D08.811.277.450.420.200.200'], ['D05.750.078.562.180', 'D09.698.365.180', 'D25.720.099.500', 'J01.637.051.720.099.500'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['D05.750.078.562.180.515', 'D05.750.078.687', 'D20.538', 'D25.720.099.687', 'J01.637.051.720.099.687'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.555', 'N06.850.425.300'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['B01.300.381.910'], ['A18.450.500.500', 'J01.637.241.900'], ['D09.698.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0
34230,Comparison of the prognostic value of tumour- and patient-related factors in patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for colon cancer.,"AIM: To comprehensively compare the prognostic value of tumour- and patient-related factors in patients undergoing curative surgery for colon cancer.METHOD: From a database of 287 patients who underwent elective resection between 1997 and 2005, tumour factors including stage and host factors including systemic inflammatory response [modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS)] were identified.RESULTS: Median follow-up was 65 months. Over this period, 125 patients died, 80 from cancer. On multivariate analysis of all significant patient and tumour related factors, Dukes stage (P < 0.01), vascular invasion (P < 0.01) and the mGPS (P < 0.01) were independently associated with cancer-survival. Of the patient-related factors, age (P < 0.01), haemoglobin (P < 0.01), white-cell (P < 0.01), neutrophil (P < 0.01) and platelet (P < 0.01) counts, and alkaline phosphatase (P < 0.01) were most significantly associated with the mGPS.CONCLUSION: In addition to tumour-related factors such as Dukes stage and vascular invasion, the preoperative mGPS should be included to guide prognosis in patients undergoing curative resection for colon cancer.","['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cause of Death', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemoglobins', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",19555389,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['D23.101'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107', 'E01.370.225.625.107', 'E05.200.500.195.107', 'E05.200.625.107', 'E05.242.195.107', 'G04.140.107', 'G09.188.105'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.250', 'N01.224.935.698.100', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.250', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.250'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['D12.776.124.400', 'D12.776.422.316.762'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

24868,Mapping by synthetic peptides of the binding sites for acetylcholine receptor on alpha-bungarotoxin.,"A set of seven peptides constituting the various loops and most of the surface areas of alpha-bungarotoxin (BgTX) was synthesized. In appropriate peptides, the cyclical (by a disulfide bond) monomers were prepared. In all cases, the peptides were purified and characterized. The ability of these peptides to bind Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor (AChR) was studied by radiometric adsorbent titrations. Three regions, represented by peptides 1-16, 26-41, and 45-59, were able to bind 125I-labeled AChR and, conversely, 125I-labeled peptides were bound by AChR. In these regions, residues Ile-1, Val-2, Trp-28, Lys-26 and/or Lys-38, and one or all of the three residues Ala-45, Ala-46, and Thr-47, are essential contact residues in the binding of BgTX to receptor. Other synthetic regions of BgTX showed little or no AChR-binding activity. The specificity of AChR binding to peptides 1-16, 26-41, and 45-59 was confirmed by inhibition with unlabeled BgTX. It is concluded that BgTX has three main AChR-binding regions (loop I with N-terminal extension and loops II and III extended toward the N-terminal by residues 45-47).","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Bungarotoxins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Receptors, Cholinergic']",3255383,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D12.125'], ['D20.888.850.325.139', 'D23.946.833.850.325.139'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E05.196.181.400.454.720', 'E05.196.401.319.720', 'E05.196.700', 'E05.393.760.705.685'], ['D12.644'], ['D12.776.543.750.720.360']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
34427,Hepatitis C virus core protein blocks interferon signaling by interaction with the STAT1 SH2 domain.,"Emerging data have indicated that hepatitis C virus (HCV) subverts the host antiviral response to ensure its persistence. We previously demonstrated that HCV protein expression suppresses type I interferon (IFN) signaling by leading to the reduction of phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1). We also demonstrated that HCV core protein directly bound to STAT1. However, the detailed mechanisms by which HCV core protein impacts IFN signaling components have not been fully clarified. In this report, we show that the STAT1 interaction domain resides in the N-terminal portion of HCV core (amino acids [aa] 1 to 23). This domain is also required to produce P-STAT1 reduction and inhibit IFN signaling transduction. Conversely, the C-terminal region of STAT1, specifically the SH2 domain (aa 577 to 684), is required for the interaction of HCV core with STAT1. The STAT1 SH2 domain is critical for STAT1 hetero- or homodimerization. We propose a model by which the binding of HCV core to STAT1 results in decreased P-STAT, blocked STAT1 heterodimerization to STAT2, and, therefore, reduced IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 binding to DNA and disrupted IFN-stimulated gene transcription.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hepacivirus', 'Humans', 'Interferons', 'Models, Genetic', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Core Proteins', 'src Homology Domains']",16940534,"[['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.440', 'D12.776.467.374.440', 'D23.529.374.440'], ['E05.599.395.397'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.644.360.024.303.500.500', 'D12.644.360.024.342.100', 'D12.776.157.057.061.500.500', 'D12.776.157.057.186.100', 'D12.776.260.513.249.500', 'D12.776.476.024.386.500.500', 'D12.776.476.024.430.100', 'D12.776.930.354.249.500', 'D12.776.930.840.100'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D12.776.964.970.600.850'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.750.500.750']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
20040,A Highly Active Form of XCL1/Lymphotactin Functions as an Effective Adjuvant to Recruit Cross-Presenting Dendritic Cells for Induction of Effector and Memory CD8+,"The chemokine receptor XCR1 is known to be selectively expressed by cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs), while its ligand XCL1/lymphotactin is mainly produced by activated CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. Recent studies have shown that XCL1-antigen fusion proteins efficiently induce CD8+ T cell responses by preferentially delivering antigens to XCR1+ DCs. However, XCL1 per se was found to be a poor adjuvant for induction of CD8+ T cell responses. XCL1 is unique because of its lack of one of the two disulfide bonds commonly conserved in all other chemokines and thus has an unstable structure with a relatively weak chemokine activity. In the present study, we generated a variant form of murine XCL1 termed mXCL1-V21C/A59C that contained a second disulfide bond to stabilize its chemokine structure. We confirmed that mXCL1-V21C/A59C had much more potent chemotactic and calcium mobilization activities than the wild type XCL1 (mXCL1-WT). Intradermal injection of mXCL1-V21C/A59C, but not that of mXCL1-WT, significantly increased the accumulation of XCR1+CD103+ DCs in the injection site, and most of the accumulated XCR1+CD103+ DCs were found to take up co-injected ovalbumin (OVA). Furthermore, recruited XCR1+CD103+ DCs efficiently migrated to the draining lymph nodes and stayed for a prolonged period of time. Consequently, mXCL1-V21C/A59C strongly induced OVA-specific CD8+ T cells. The combination of OVA and mXCL1-V21C/A59C well protected mice from E.G7-OVA tumor growth in both prophylactic and therapeutic protocols. Finally, memory CTL responses were efficiently induced in mice immunized with OVA and mXCL1-V21C/A59C. Although intradermal injection of OVA and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) as an adjuvant also induced CD8+ T cell responses to OVA, poly (I:C) poorly recruited XCR1+CD103+ DCs in the injection site and failed to induce significant memory CTL responses to OVA. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that a highly active form of XCL1 is a promising vaccine adjuvant for cross-presenting DCs to induce antigen-specific effector and memory CD8+ T cells.","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antigens, CD', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Calcium', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokines, C', 'Cross-Priming', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Integrin alpha Chains', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Lymphokines', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Ovalbumin', 'Sialoglycoproteins']",30542351,"[['D27.505.696.477.067'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.050'], ['D23.050.301.264.035', 'D23.101.100.110'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.220', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.220', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.220'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.100', 'D12.776.467.374.200.100', 'D23.125.300.100', 'D23.469.200.100', 'D23.529.374.200.100'], ['G12.450.050.400.545.150', 'G12.565.150'], ['A11.066.270', 'A11.436.270', 'A15.382.066.270', 'A15.382.670.260'], ['G12.450.050.500'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.408.100'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.537', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.537', 'A15.382.490.555.567.537'], ['D12.644.276.374.480', 'D12.776.467.374.480', 'D23.529.374.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['D12.644.861.557', 'D12.776.034.614', 'D12.776.256.159.157.663', 'D12.776.290.663', 'D12.776.872.557'], ['D12.644.233.800', 'D12.776.395.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
21961,"Constipation in the elderly from Northern Sardinia is positively associated with depression, malnutrition and female gender.","OBJECTIVES: Constipation is a common complaint in older adults. The rise in life expectancy may amplify the problem and increase social expenditure. We investigated the major risk factors associated with constipation in a large sample of elderly.METHODS: Outpatients from Northern Sardinia attending a Geriatric Unit between 2001 and 2014 were enrolled. Demographic and anthropometric data, income, education and self-reported bowel function were collected. The presence of constipation was adjusted for cognitive status, assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test; single and cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS); current or past symptomatic depression and anxiety measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS); nutritional status, evaluated using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA); type and number of different medications used.RESULTS: 1328 elderly patients (mean age 77.7 ± 7.2 years) were enrolled. Constipation was present in 32.1%, more commonly in women (35.4% vs 28.3%) and increased with age. The multivariate analysis showed a significantly greater risk of constipation in patients with a risk of malnutrition (OR = 1.745, 95% CI: 1.043-2.022; p = .034), female gender (OR = 1.735, 95% CI: 1.068-2.820; p = .026) and depression (OR = 1.079, 95% CI: 1.022-1.140; p = .006). Other potential predisposing factors assessed such as MMSE, CIRS, body mass index, marital status, smoking habit, education, income and number of taken drugs did not show a statistically significant association. Aging was a risk for constipation also in patients free of medications.CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of risk factors associated with bowel alterations in elderly individuals may provide important clues for caregivers to prevent or reduce constipation.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Body Mass Index', 'Constipation', 'Depression', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Malnutrition', 'Mental Status Schedule', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional Status', 'Outpatients', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",29779417,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G07.345.124'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['C23.888.821.150'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['E05.318.308.225', 'I01.240.425.350', 'N01.224.425.350', 'N05.715.360.300.360', 'N06.850.505.400.425.350', 'N06.850.520.308.225'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.542.489'], ['C18.654.521'], ['F04.711.513.603.500', 'F04.711.513.653.574'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['E05.318.308.585', 'N05.715.360.300.560', 'N06.850.505.557', 'N06.850.520.308.585'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['M01.643.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
34987,Delay of early B-lymphocyte development by gamma 2b immunoglobulin transgene: effect on differentiation-specific molecules.,"Mice transgenic for gamma 2b Ig heavy chain were examined for alterations in B-cell differentiation and endogenous Ig gene rearrangement and expression. Fresh bone marrow from these mice was markedly reduced in BP-1+ cells and there were small reductions in B220+ and sIg+ cells. A-MuLV (Abelson murine leukemia virus) transformants from these bone marrow cells showed little alteration in Ig gene rearrangement and expression when compared to controls, however. Isolation of the B-lymphoid compartment from these mice in vitro using LBMC (lymphoid bone marrow cultures) enabled more detailed characterization of the effects of the transgene. LBMC derived from gamma 2b transgenic mice had similar growth kinetics, but a 4-5-week delay in the expression of endogenous mu Ig in comparison to control cultures. Nucleic acids derived from these early cultures prior to endogenous mu Ig expression showed reduced Ig JH rearrangements, some sterile mu transcription, low levels of BP-1 expression, and virtually undetectable TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) expression. Thus, this gamma 2b transgene appears able to affect early B-lymphocyte development.","['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Culture Techniques', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1967016,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['A15.382.216'], ['A11.148', 'A15.378.316'], ['G04.152'], ['E05.481.500'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.344.801.311', 'G12.500.287.311'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.335', 'G12.500.299'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393.522', 'D12.776.124.486.485.705.500.380', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393.522', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.500.380', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393.522', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.500.380'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.574.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.705.500.500', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.574.500', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.500.500', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.574.500', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4278,Protease activation and the signal transduction pathway regulating motility in sperm from the water strider Aquarius remigis.,"Many motile processes are regulated such that movement occurs only upon activation of a signaling cascade. Sperm from a variety of species are initially quiescent and must be activated prior to beating. The signaling events leading to the activation and regulation of sperm motility are not well characterized. Mature seminal vesicle sperm from the water strider Aquarius remigis are immotile in vitro, but vigorous motility is activated by trypsin. Trypsin-activated motility was blocked by pretreatment of the sperm with BAPTA-AM to chelate intracellular Ca(2+) and was partially rescued by subsequent addition of A23187 and Ca(2+). Thapsigargin stimulated motility in the absence of trypsin, suggesting that intracellular Ca(2+) stores are available. In addition, motility could be fully activated by the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A, suggesting that the immotile state is maintained by an endogenous phosphatase and that kinase activity is required for motility. The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly reduced trypsin activated motility, and MPM-2, an antibody which recognizes proline-directed phosphorylation by kinases such as MAPK, recognized components of the water strider sperm flagellum. Antibodies specific for the mouse protease activated receptor PAR2 recognized an antigen on the sperm flagellum. These results suggest that trypsin stimulates a Ca(2+) and MAPK mediated signaling pathway and potentially implicate a PAR2-like protein in regulating motility.","['Animals', 'Calcium', 'Egtazic Acid', 'Heteroptera', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Marine Toxins', 'Oxazoles', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases', 'Receptor, PAR-2', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sperm Motility', 'Spermatozoa', 'Staurosporine', 'Thapsigargin', 'Trypsin']",22278949,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D02.092.782.258.368.257', 'D02.241.081.018.269'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.412.420'], ['G02.111.820.560', 'G03.493.560', 'G04.835.560'], ['D23.946.580'], ['D03.383.129.462'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D27.505.519.389.755'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.035', 'D12.776.543.750.792.249'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['E01.370.225.992.812', 'E05.200.992.812', 'G04.198.750'], ['A05.360.490.890', 'A11.497.760'], ['D03.132.436.750', 'D03.633.100.473.144.750', 'D03.633.100.473.402.750', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.750', 'D03.633.300.148.750'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.284.500.888', 'D02.455.849.765.674.500.750.888', 'D04.663.500.750.888'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.895', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.895']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27735,Pulmonary function in aluminium smelter and surrounding community--a case study.,"The increase of industrial activities in the Angul-Talcher area, Orissa resulted in indiscriminate disposal of waste into the environment leading to the deterioration of the quality of the environment, which affects the health of the workers as well as the community people. Considering the magnitude of the problem, the pulmonary function study had been carried out in one of the largest aluminium producing plant of the country as well as surrounding community people. Aluminium is produced from oxides of alumina by Hall-Heroult smelting process. The electrolysis called as aluminium smelting is carried out in an electrolytic cell (pot) having anode, cathode and electrolyte. The aluminium is deposited in the cathode and the oxygen moves towards anode is released. The workers working at the captive power plant (CPP), which is necessary to meet the power demand of the smelter plant were also investigated. 180 smelter plants workers (non-smoker 129, smoker-51) of different sections and 37 captive power plant workers (non-smoker 29, smoker-8) had undergone pulmonary function tests. Besides these, 85 persons from the surrounding community (non-smoker-66, smoker-19) were also investigated. The workers were all male. Spirometric assessments of Vital Capacity (VC), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) were done by Spirovit-sp-10 (Schiller Health Care Ltd, Switzerland) and Wrights Peak flow meter (Clement and Clarke, UK). Different lung volumes like FEV1, FEV1%, and flow rates like FEF200-1200ml, FEF25-75% and FEF75-85% were calculated from the same tracings pulmonary function test (PFT) results of the workers according to different age groups, duration of exposures and smoking habits. The mean values of SVC, FVC and FEV1 of smelter plant workers were found higher compared to the community people but the values of captive power plant workers were very much close to the values of the community people. A gradual decrement of the PFT values was found as duration of exposure increased. Lung volumes and the flow rates were decreased as age increases but in some age groups that trend was not followed. It has been found that in each category of subjects, smokers have the higher mean pulmonary function values compared to the non-smokers. Except the community people in all other cases the different flow rates were found higher in nonsmokers compared to smokers. The restrictive, obstructive and combined restrictive and obstructive types of impairments among the subjects were noticed. The respiratory impairment among the workers as a whole was found higher in smelter plant workers (9.44%) followed by the captive power plant workers (5.40%) and the community people (2.35%). In smelter plant workers both the restrictive and obstructive impairments were found higher compared to captive power plant and the community people.","['Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational', 'Aluminum', 'Forced Expiratory Volume', 'Humans', 'Industrial Waste', 'Lung', 'Lung Diseases, Obstructive', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Vital Capacity']",18476380,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.888.284.101.268'], ['D01.268.557.050', 'D01.552.547.050'], ['E01.370.386.700.660.230', 'G09.772.650.430'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D20.944.420', 'N06.850.460.710.420'], ['A04.411'], ['C08.381.495'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C24'], ['N06.850.460.350.600'], ['F01.145.805'], ['E01.370.386.700.750'], ['E01.370.386.700.485.750.900', 'G09.772.850.970']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
13540,Behavioral and neurochemical studies on brain aging in galanin overexpressing mice.,"To study possible involvement of galanin in brain aging quality, we have investigated behavioral, neurochemical and morphological parameters in aged mice overexpressing galanin under the platelet-derived growth factor B promoter (GalOE mice) compared to wild-type littermates (WT mice). The behavioral analysis in the forced swim test showed that old GalOE animals spent more time in immobility compared to WT. In the activity cage test, galanin overexpression counteracted the age-induced decrease in exploratory behavior. The neurochemical analysis showed a 30% decrease in noradrenaline overflow in the cerebral cortex of WT old mice that was not present in age-matched GalOE mice. Our results indicate that overexpression of galanin can influence several behavioral and neurochemical parameters in old mice.","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain', 'Depression', 'Dopamine', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Galanin', 'Gene Expression', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Norepinephrine', 'Tritium']",15944027,"[['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050'], ['F01.470.132'], ['F01.145.113'], ['A08.186.211'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['F01.145.387', 'F01.658.370'], ['D12.644.400.250', 'D12.776.631.650.250'], ['G05.297'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['D02.033.100.291.502', 'D02.092.063.480', 'D02.092.211.215.746', 'D02.092.311.830', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.830'], ['D01.268.406.875', 'D01.362.340.875', 'D01.496.749.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
30739,"Anthocyanin-rich extracts from blackberry, wild blueberry, strawberry, and chokeberry: antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect on oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis in vitro.","BACKGROUND: Limited information is available regarding the relationship between the chemical structures and inhibitory effects of anthocyanin (ACN) on triglyceride (TG) overaccumulation. Thus this study investigated the antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect of blackberry, wild blueberry, strawberry, and chokeberry ACN-rich extracts, with different structural characteristics, on oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis in vitro. Four major ACNs from these berries, with different aglycones, namely cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glu), delphinidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside, were also investigated.RESULTS: Blackberry ACN-rich extract exhibited the most significant inhibitory effect on TG clearance (30.5% ± 3.4%) and reactive oxygen species generation. TG clearance was significantly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.991, P < 0.05) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity value (r = 0.961, P < 0.05). Furthermore, Cy-3-glu showed the highest inhibitory effect on intracellular TG overaccumulation, with a maximum TG clearance of 61.3% at 40 µg mL(-1) .CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of different ACNs on oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis significantly vary. Cy-3-glu, which contains the ortho hydroxyl group in its B ring, possibly confers the protective effects of antioxidants and inhibits TG accumulation in HepG2 cells. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.","['Animals', 'Anthocyanins', 'Antioxidants', 'Blueberry Plants', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fragaria', 'Fruit', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Oleic Acid', 'Plant Extracts', 'Prunus', 'Rubus']",26250597,"[['B01.050'], ['D03.383.663.283.266.450.087', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.087', 'D09.408.084', 'D23.767.124'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.341.937.774.249'], ['C06.552.241'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.266'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['A11.251.860.180.432', 'A11.436.348.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G03.458'], ['D10.251.355.325.600.525'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.625'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.764']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
4934,Leukemia-derived exosomes induced IL-8 production in bone marrow stromal cells to protect the leukemia cells against chemotherapy.,"AIMS: The interplay between bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells plays a critical role in AML drug resistance by secreting growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles. As kind of extracellular vesicles, exosomes consist of proteins and RNAs and regulate communication among cells.MAIN METHODS: The BMSCs, HS5 cells, and AML cells were co-cultivated with transwell membranes, and treated with different doses of AML chemotherapy drug, etoposide.KEY FINDINGS: Findings of our research proved that co-cultivation of BMSCs with AML cells defended AML against cell death triggered via etoposide, without having an impact on cell growth. An increase in the expression of the 70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) as well as lysosomal associated membrane protein 3 (CD63) was observed in the exosomes from BMSC and AML, co-cultivated in conditioned media. Exosome repression in BMSC and AML co-cultivating system rebuilt the sensitivity of the KG1A cells to apoptosis triggered via etoposide, indicating that exosome modulated drug resistance in AML. Our study proved that exosomes arising from KG1A cells could propel BMSCs to generate IL-8, which could regulate the effect of etoposide treatment. Furthermore, IL-8 inhibition by its antibody increased the sensitivity of AML cells to cell death triggered via etoposide.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggested that exosomes secreted by AML cells is an essential communicator for the interaction of BMSCs and AML, which can protect AML cells from chemotherapy drug induced apoptosis.","['Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide', 'Exosomes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protective Agents', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",30716336,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['G07.690.773.984.395'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.638.960.675.250', 'D04.615.638.960.675.250', 'D09.408.348.275'], ['A11.284.295.588.750', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.880.495'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.120.800', 'D12.644.276.374.465.312', 'D12.776.467.374.200.120.800', 'D12.776.467.374.465.246', 'D23.125.300.120.800', 'D23.469.200.120.800', 'D23.529.374.200.120.800', 'D23.529.374.465.312'], ['C04.557.337.539.275'], ['A11.329.830.500', 'A11.872.590.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.223.500', 'E05.200.500.265.500', 'E05.242.223.500', 'E05.481.500.249.500'], ['D27.505.696.706', 'D27.720.799'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
32296,Systemic blood pressure after stent management for arch coarctation implications for clinical care.,"OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to prospectively assess blood pressure (BP) and echocardiographic parameters to delineate the incidence and nature of the hypertension burden in this cohort.BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the long-term outcomes of aortic stenting.METHODS: Thirty-one patients with successfully stented coarctation during childhood (mean age 12.4 years) underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), exercise BP measurement, and echocardiographic assessment.RESULTS: Mean time after stent implantation was 5.3 ± 4 years. Hypertension was noted on one-off right-arm BP assessment in 3 patients (10%), but on the basis of the 24-h ABPM assessment in 14 patients (45%). Twenty-four of 31 patients (80%) had an abnormally elevated exercise BP response. Peak exercise BP correlated with left ventricular mass index (r = 0.51; p < 0.05), which was also significantly increased in the entire cohort (mean = 91.3 g/m(2); p < 0.05). In patients with significant somatic growth since implantation, the indexed diameter of the stent (to aortic diameter) had significantly decreased from the 48th percentile at the implantation to the 4th percentile during the study (p < 0.05). There was no difference in any parameter between patients with native or those with recurrent coarctation.CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension is endemic in patients with stented coarctation, irrespective of the absence of residual obstruction. Due to abnormal BP homeostasis, hypertension should be aggressively pursued by ABPM assessment and exercise stress testing in this population.

42026,Laboratory testing of whole cell pertussis vaccine: a WHO proficiency study using the Kendrick test.,"Whole cell pertussis vaccine (WCV), commonly in combination with vaccines for diphtheria and tetanus, has an important role in reducing morbidity and mortality among children in most parts of the world. Testing to assure the efficacy of such vaccines is essential. We have, therefore, carried out, under the Global Training Network (GTN) of the Department of Vaccines and Biologicals at the World Health Organization (WHO), a proficiency study involving 13 laboratories in 12 countries that routinely test WCV. Two vaccine samples were tested in this study and represented samples which were expected clearly either to pass (sample B, a full strength vaccine) or to fail (sample A, 1/8 strength of vaccine B). Data from this study showed good performance by the majority of participants. Most assays were statistically valid and were carried out to the level of precision achieved for these assays in previous studies. This study also indicated that, relative to the assay precision, the in-house reference (IHR) preparations are in general accurately calibrated. Statistically valid assays of the sub-potent vaccine, A, showed it to fail in all except one laboratory. Statistically valid assays of the potent vaccine, B, showed it to pass in all laboratories. Nevertheless, the between laboratory variability of estimates for vaccine B, and for comparisons of the two vaccine samples suggested that there are some differences in results in different laboratories. The introduction of a common working standard may assist in reducing inter-laboratory variation. This study has shown clearly satisfactory performance by most laboratories. However, a serious problem was detected in one laboratory where the sub-potent vaccine A could have been passed and was not distinguished from the eight-fold more potent vaccine B. There were also indications of possible problems in several other laboratories, where IHR preparation may not be accurately calibrated or where vaccine samples A and B may not be completely distinguished. Although this study provides reassurance that most laboratories perform well, it demonstrates the essential role of ongoing proficiency studies in high-lighting problems.","['Animals', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Mice', 'Pertussis Vaccine', 'World Health Organization']",11672896,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.940.402', 'G07.225.500', 'G07.690.773.875.750', 'G07.690.936.500.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D20.215.894.135.535'], ['N03.540.514.718.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In this study, we attempt to analyze the independent and joint effect of variants from these loci on type 2 diabetes and clinical phenotypes related to glucose metabolism.METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from fourteen loci were successfully genotyped in 1,849 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 1,785 subjects with normal glucose regulation. We analyzed the allele and genotype distribution between the cases and controls of these SNPs as well as the joint effects of the susceptible loci on type 2 diabetes risk. The associations between SNPs and type 2 diabetes were examined by logistic regression. The associations between SNPs and quantitative traits were examined by linear regression. The discriminative accuracy of the prediction models was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. We confirmed the effects of SNPs from PPARG, KCNJ11, CDKAL1, CDKN2A-CDKN2B, IDE-KIF11-HHEX, IGF2BP2 and SLC30A8 on risk for type 2 diabetes, with odds ratios ranging from 1.114 to 1.406 (P value range from 0.0335 to 1.37E-12). But no significant association was detected between SNPs from WFS1, FTO, JAZF1, TSPAN8-LGR5, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2-ADAM30 and type 2 diabetes. Analyses on the quantitative traits in the control subjects showed that THADA SNP rs7578597 was association with 2-h insulin during oral glucose tolerance tests (P = 0.0005, empirical P = 0.0090). The joint effect analysis of SNPs from eleven loci showed the individual carrying more risk alleles had a significantly higher risk for type 2 diabetes. And the type 2 diabetes patients with more risk allele tended to have earlier diagnostic ages (P = 0.0006).CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The current study confirmed the association between PPARG, KCNJ11, CDKAL1, CDKN2A-CDKN2B, IDE-KIF11-HHEX, IGF2BP2 and SLC30A8 and type 2 diabetes.

21245,"Kinetic and mechanistic studies of the electrocatalytic reduction of O2 TO H2O with mononuclear Cu complexes of substituted 1,10-phenanthrolines.","Mononuclear Cu complexes with a 1,10-phenanthroline-based ligand adsorbed onto an edge-plane graphite electrode act as electrocatalysts for the 4-electron reduction of O2 to H2O. A mechanism is proposed for the electrocatalytic O2 reduction that accounts for the observed redox and kinetic dependences on coordinating anions and proton donors in the buffer. Systematic increases of ligand electron-withdrawing properties and/or the steric demands near the Cu center increase the E0 of the Cu catalysts but decrease the rate of O2 reduction. The kinetic rate of O2 reduction at E0, reported as kinetic current divided by catalyst redox charge, decreases as E0 increases: from 16 s(-1) measured at E0 in air-saturated solutions for adsorbed Cu(phen) to 0.4 s(-1) for Cu(2,9-Et2-phen). The maximum value of E for which catalytic activity can be attained is estimated to be +350 mV vs NHE. Near E0, the kinetic current deviates from that expected if O2 binding were the sole rate-limiting step. This indicates that one or more of the electrochemical reduction steps are rate limiting at potentials near E0.","['Catalysis', 'Copper', 'Kinetics', 'Oxygen', 'Phenanthrolines', 'Water']",18076134,"[['G02.130'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['D03.633.300.669'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

47424,Tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA) acquired in Southwestern Germany.,"BACKGROUND: Tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA) was first described in 1997 in a patient in France. The causative agent, Rickettsia slovaca, is transmitted by Dermacentor ticks.CASE PRESENTATION: In southwestern Germany we encountered a patient with a tick bite at the dorsal scalp that resulted in an eschar and nuchal lymphadenopathy. Additionally, fever, malaise as well as elevated inflammatory markers and transaminases occurred. The characteristic clinical picture along with positive antibody testing for rickettsiae of the tick-borne spotted fever group strongly suggest the diagnosis TIBOLA.CONCLUSION: Human rickettsioses are emerging infections. Clinicians should be aware of TIBOLA as a newly described rickettsial disease. As in our case, TIBOLA may be encountered in regions/countries where R. slovaca and Dermacentor ticks are prevalent but autochthonous acquisition was not described before.","['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial', 'Arachnid Vectors', 'Dermacentor', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Diseases', 'Rickettsia', 'Rickettsia Infections']",21663601,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.107', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.125', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.125'], ['N06.850.335.188.100.100', 'N06.850.520.203.375.100.100'], ['B01.050.500.131.166.132.832.400.200'], ['Z01.542.315'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C15.604'], ['B03.660.050.783.875.650.650'], ['C01.150.252.400.789.725', 'C01.920.914.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
12188,Primary stent angioplasty of the inferior vena cava after liver transplantation and liver resection.,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated technical efficacy and safety of stent angioplasty of the inferior vena cava (IVC) after liver transplantation or liver resection and analysis of changes in creatinine levels and patients' weight.METHODS: Between October 2004 and February 2011, 16 patients (mean age, 52.6 years) with symptomatic IVC stenoses after liver transplantation (n = 10) or liver resection (n = 6) were subjected to stent angioplasty. Enrollment criteria included edema and/or ascites. The smallest diameter of the IVC, serum creatinine values, and patients' weight were assessed before and after stent placement and respective values were compared. Technical and clinical success, patency rates, related complications, and patients' survival were analyzed.RESULTS: Stent placement was technically successful in 16 patients (100 %). Clinical success was achieved in 13 patients (81.25 %), reflecting two patients with early restenosis and one patient suffering from thrombosis distal to the stent. Mean follow-up was 372 days. Primary patencies were 75 % (n = 12). Primary assisted patencies were 93.75 % (n = 15). Serum creatinine levels decreased significantly (p = 0.01) from 1.68 mg/dl before to 1.08 mg/dl after stent placement. Patients' weight decreased (mean 2.1 %). No angioplasty-related complications occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Stent angioplasty of the IVC is an effective and safe treatment of stenoses after liver transplantation and resection and has a positive effect on creatinine levels.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Angioplasty', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Constriction, Pathologic', 'Creatinine', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Female', 'Hepatectomy', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stents', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Patency', 'Vena Cava, Inferior']",24091757,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E02.148.050', 'E04.100.814.529.124', 'E04.502.382.124', 'E05.157.016'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['M01.060.406'], ['C23.300.287'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['E01.370.350'], ['E04.210.556'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.552'], ['E02.095.147.725.490', 'E04.210.650', 'E04.936.450.490', 'E04.936.580.490'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E07.695.750'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['G09.330.920'], ['A07.015.908.949.648']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
12389,Results of chemotherapy for cats with alimentary malignant lymphoma: 21 cases (1993-1997),"OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and pathologic findings in cats with alimentary malignant lymphoma and results of treatment with a combination of prednisone, L-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and methotrexate.DESIGN: Retrospective study.ANIMALS: 21 cats with alimentary malignant lymphoma.PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed, and information on signalment, clinical history and signs, previous treatments, and results of laboratory tests, thoracic radiography, and abdominal ultrasonography were obtained.RESULTS: Test results in all cats were negative for FeLV; 3 of 19 were positive for feline immunodeficiency virus. Thirteen tumors were stage III, 7 were stage IV, and 1 was stage V. Diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of microscopic examination of histologic (n = 13) or cytologic (8) specimens. Immunophenotyping was performed on 13 tumors; 10 were T-cell and 3 were B-cell lymphomas. Overall median duration of first remission was 20 weeks. Overall median survival time was 40 weeks. The only factor significantly associated with duration of first remission was whether cats had a complete response following induction chemotherapy; duration of first remission was significantly associated with survival time. Cats tolerated treatment well; only 1 cat had a delay in the treatment schedule because of neutropenia.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Use of a multidrug chemotherapeutic protocol that includes L-asparaginase and doxorubicin results in minimal adverse effects and prolonged survival times in cats with alimentary malignant lymphoma.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Asparaginase', 'Cat Diseases', 'Cats', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Digestive System Neoplasms', 'Doxorubicin', 'Female', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma', 'Male', 'Methotrexate', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine']",9787382,"[['B01.050'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D08.811.277.087.116'], ['C22.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.377.750.250.125'], ['D02.455.526.728.650.730.243', 'D02.705.672.500.243'], ['C04.588.274', 'C06.301'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['E01.370.225.812.447', 'E05.200.812.447', 'E05.478.594.450'], ['C04.557.386', 'C15.604.515.569', 'C20.683.515.761'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.192.500'], ['E01.789.625'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.719.702'], ['E02.860'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D03.132.436.681.827.817', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.827.817', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.827.817']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
38662,Glucocorticoid receptor isoforms alpha and beta in in vitro cytokine-induced glucocorticoid insensitivity.,"We stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 14 healthy subjects, 14 patients with stable asthma, and 13 patients with unstable asthma with interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 to induce glucocorticoid insensitivity and we examined the relationship between insensitivity and the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) isoforms. Results are expressed as IC(50) (nanomolar) values (means +/- SD) in proliferation assays and as 10(3) cDNA molecules per microgram of total RNA (means +/- SD) in real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cells from patients with unstable asthma were less sensitive (316 +/- 7 nM) to dexamethasone antiproliferative effects than those from healthy control subjects (102 +/- 4 nM, p < 0.05) and patients with stable asthma (107 +/- 2 nM, p < 0.05). Coincubation with IL-2 and IL-4 repressed the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on proliferation in all groups (unstable: 851 +/- 47 nM, p < 0.01; stable: 912 +/- 52 nM, p = 0.001; control subjects: 537 +/- 45 nM, p = 0.001). GR-alpha mRNA baseline expression was higher in patients with unstable asthma [(1.95 +/- 0.40) x 10(3) cDNA molecules/microg total RNA, p < 0.05] than in patients with stable asthma [(1.46 +/- 0.35) x 10(3) cDNA molecules/microg total RNA] and healthy subjects [(1.35 +/- 0.25) x 10(3) cDNA molecules/microg total RNA]. GR-beta mRNA was 600 times lower than GR-alpha in the three groups. Coincubation with IL-2 and IL-4 significantly increased GR-alpha mRNA expression in the three groups (p < 0.01), but caused no significant change in GR-beta mRNA. GR-alpha, but not GR-beta, protein was detected at baseline and after cytokine exposure. Our data do not support the hypothesis that increased GR-beta expression can contribute to cytokine-induced glucocorticoid insensitivity.","['Adult', 'Asthma', 'Cytokines', 'Dexamethasone', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2', 'Interleukin-4', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Monocytes', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",15184204,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.769.344', 'D04.210.500.908.238'], ['D06.472.040.543', 'D27.505.696.399.472.488'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.021', 'D12.644.276.374.480.372', 'D12.776.467.374.465.021', 'D12.776.467.374.480.372', 'D23.529.374.465.155', 'D23.529.374.480.372'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.186', 'D12.776.467.374.465.178', 'D23.529.374.465.186'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['A11.118.637.555.652', 'A11.148.580', 'A11.627.624', 'A11.733.547', 'A15.145.229.637.555.652', 'A15.378.316.580', 'A15.382.490.555.652', 'A15.382.670.547', 'A15.382.680.547'], ['D12.776.800'], ['D12.776.826.750.430'], ['E05.393.620.500.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
212,Endovascular repair of complex aortic aneurysms: intravascular ultrasound guidance with an intracardiac probe.,"To assess the accuracy and efficacy of intravascular ultrasound guidance obtained by an intracardiac ultrasound probe during complex aortic endografting. Between November 1999 and July 2002, 19 patients (5 female, 14 male; mean age 73.5 +/- 2.1 years) underwent endovascular repair of thoracic (n = 10), complex abdominal (n = 6) and concomitant thoraco-abdominal (n = 3) aortic aneurysm. The most suitable size and configuration of the stent-graft were chosen on the basis of preoperative computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Intraoperative intravascular ultrasound imaging was obtained using a 9 Fr, 9 MHz intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) probe, 110 cm in length, inserted through a 10 Fr precurved long sheath. The endografts were deployed as planned by CTA or MRA. Before stent-graft deployment, the ICE probe allowed us to view the posterior aortic arch and descending thoraco-abdominal aorta without position-related artifacts, and to identify both sites of stent-graft positioning. After stent-graft deployment, the ICE probe allowed us to detect the need for additional modular components to internally reline the aorta in 11 patients, and to discover 2 incomplete graft expansions subsequently treated with adjunctive balloon angioplasty. In 1 patient, the ICE probe supported the decision that the patient was ineligible for the endovascular exclusion procedure. The ICE probe provides accurate information on the anatomy of the posterior aortic arch and thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms and a rapid identification of attachment sites and stent-graft pathology, allowing refinement and improvement of the endovascular strategy.","['Aged', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional']",14753303,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C14.907.055.239.075', 'C14.907.109.139.075'], ['C14.907.055.239.125', 'C14.907.109.139.125'], ['E01.370.350.130.750', 'E01.370.350.850.220', 'E01.370.370.380.220'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E01.370.350.850.855', 'E04.502.890']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
1398,Trauma-induced alterations in cognition and Arc expression are reduced by previous exposure to 56Fe irradiation.,"Exposure to ionizing irradiation may affect brain functions directly, but may also change tissue sensitivity to a secondary insult such as trauma, stroke, or degenerative disease. To determine if a low dose of particulate irradiation sensitizes the brain to a subsequent injury, C56BL6 mice were exposed to brain only irradiation with 0.5 Gy of (56) Fe ions. Two months later, unilateral traumatic brain injury was induced using a controlled cortical impact system. Three weeks after trauma, animals received multiple BrdU injections and 30 days later were tested for cognitive performance in the Morris water maze. All animals were able to locate the visible and hidden platform during training; however, treatment effects were seen when spatial memory retention was assessed in the probe trial (no platform). Although sham and irradiated animals showed spatial memory retention, mice that received trauma alone did not. When trauma was preceded by irradiation, performance in the water maze was not different from sham-treated animals, suggesting that low-dose irradiation had a protective effect in the context of a subsequent traumatic injury. Measures of hippocampal neurogenesis showed that combined injury did not induce any changes greater that those seen after trauma or radiation alone. After trauma, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of neurons expressing the behaviorally induced immediate early gene Arc in both hemispheres, without associated neuronal loss. After combined injury there were no differences relative to sham-treated mice. Our results suggest that combined injury resulted in decreased alterations of our endpoints compared to trauma alone. Although the underlying mechanisms are not yet known, these results resemble a preconditioning, adaptive, or inducible-like protective response, where a sublethal or potentially injurious stimulus (i.e., irradiation) induces tolerance to a subsequent and potentially more damaging insult (trauma).","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cognition', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Male', 'Maze Learning', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons']",21192069,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C10.228.140.199', 'C10.900.300.087', 'C26.915.300.200'], ['F02.463.188'], ['D12.776.220'], ['F02.463.425.874.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.776.631'], ['G04.152.912', 'G07.345.500.325.377.687', 'G08.686.784.170.450.500', 'G11.561.620'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
16638,"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders and associated factors among bank workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are dramatically increased in the world due to the advancement of technology and competitiveness of markets. There were limited studies carried out regarding WMSDs among bank workers in Africa particularly in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of work-related musculoskeletal disorders and associated factors among bank workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed in the study. Multi-stage sampling techniques were used to select 838 bank workers from 62 banks in Addis Ababa. Self-administered standard Nordic questionnaires were used as well. Multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were employed to identify factors associated with WMSDs. Moreover adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and p value < 0.05 was used to show the strength of association between explanatory variables and dependent variable.RESULTS: Out of 838 total numbers of participants, 755 bank workers returned their questionnaires responding with a rate of 90%. Of these, 77.6% (N = 586) suffered WMSDs with a 95% CI [75-81%]. Based on the final multivariate logistic regression analysis being female [AOR = 2.98, 95% CI 1.91-4.65], sitting back in a twisted position [AOR = 3.59, 95% CI 2.13-6.08], sitting back bent [AOR = 4.06, 95% CI 2.48-6.66], work on fixed position [AOR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.17-2.71], no work time break [AOR = 3.33, 95% CI 1.44-7.71], type of chairs [AOR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.19-5.75] and job stress [AOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.19-4.54] were factors significantly associated with WMSDs.CONCLUSION: From the study's findings, the magnitude of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among bank workers was high. Being female, awkward posture, no work time break, fixed position, type of chairs, and job stress are the factors significantly associated with WMSDs. So bank workers should use proper types of chairs, practice proper work posture, increase healthy working conditions, and create awareness programs on how to maintain beneficial health conditions which may lead to increased leisure time.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Banking, Personal', 'Cities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ethiopia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Occupational Diseases', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",32718332,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['N03.219.463.030.100'], ['G16.500.275.069', 'N06.230.069', 'Z01.433'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['Z01.058.290.120.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05'], ['C24'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Considerable debate has focused on how PVI should be defined, and the techniques used to detect them have differed considerably from one study to another.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our study, 167 cases of N- breast cancers were reviewed, with a view to determining whether or not PVI, as defined in the recently published European recommendations, were present.RESULTS: Based on the results of the subsequent statistical study, the presence of PVI was not found to constitute a reliable prognostic index to the outcome of N- breast cancer.CONCLUSION: Referring each case to the data available in the literature, the difficulties encountered when searching for PVI of this kind are described, the results of various studies on the topic are reviewed and whether it is worth pursuing studies along these lines is discussed.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Rate', 'Vascular Neoplasms']",10216503,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['C04.588.180.260', 'C17.800.090.500.260'], ['E02.186.170', 'E02.319.170'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['A11.642', 'C04.697.650.900', 'C23.550.727.650.900'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['C04.588.839.750', 'C14.907.936']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
11048,Carborane-derived local anesthetics are isomer dependent.,"Clinically there is a need for local anesthetics with a greater specificity of action on target cells and longer duration. We have synthesized a series of local anesthetic derivatives we call boronicaines in which the aromatic phenyl ring of lidocaine was replaced with ortho-, meta-, C,C'-dimethyl meta- and para-carborane clusters. The boronicaine derivatives were tested for their analgesic activity and compared with lidocaine using standard procedures in mice following a plantar injection. The compounds differed in their analgesic activity in the following order: ortho-carborane = C,C'-dimethyl meta-carborane > para-carborane > lidocaine > meta-carborane derivative. Both ortho-boronicaine and C,C'-dimethyl meta-boronicaine had longer durations of analgesia than lidocaine. Differences in analgesic efficacies are rationalized by variations in chemical structure and protein binding characteristics.","['Anesthetics, Local', 'Animals', 'Area Under Curve', 'Binding Sites', 'Boranes', 'Catalysis', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Lidocaine', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Pain', 'Palladium', 'ROC Curve', 'Serum Albumin']",25420874,"[['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.318.740.200', 'G03.787.101', 'G07.690.725.064', 'N06.850.520.830.200'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['D01.132.105', 'D02.203.087'], ['G02.130'], ['G02.111.570.120.704', 'G02.111.570.820.709.275.750.188'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.570.685', 'G02.607.445'], ['D02.065.199.092.500', 'D02.092.146.113.092.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E05.599.595.249', 'L01.224.160.249'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['D01.268.556.680', 'D01.268.956.718', 'D01.552.544.680'], ['E05.318.370.800.750', 'E05.318.740.872.750', 'N05.715.360.325.700.680', 'N06.850.520.445.800.750'], ['D12.776.034.841', 'D12.776.124.727']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
2338,"Common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is active neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (""enkephalinase""): direct evidence by cDNA transfection analysis.","The common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is a 749-amino acid type II integral membrane protein expressed by most acute lymphoblastic leukemias, certain other lymphoid malignancies with an immature phenotype, and normal lymphoid progenitors. A computer search against the most recent GenBank release (no. 56) indicates that human CALLA cDNA encodes a protein nearly identical to the rat and rabbit neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (""enkephalinase;"" EC 3.4.24.11). This zinc metalloendopeptidase, which has been shown to inactivate a variety of peptide hormones including enkephalin, chemotactic peptide, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, bradykinin, and angiotensins I and II, had not been identified in lymphoid cells. To determine whether CALLA cDNA derived from human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Nalm-6 cell line) encodes functional neutral endopeptidase activity, we generated CALLA+ stable transfectants in the CALLA- murine myeloma cell line J558 and analyzed them for enzymatic activity in a fluorometric assay based upon cleavage of the substrate glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide at the Ala-Phe bond. Total lysates as well as whole-cell suspensions of the Nalm-6 line and of the CALLA+ transfectants, but not of the CALLA- J558 cells, possessed neutral endopeptidase activity. This enzymatic activity was associated with the cellular membrane fraction and was abrogated by the specific neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon. The unequivocal identification of CALLA as a functional neutral endopeptidase provides insight into its potential role in both normal and malignant lymphoid function.","['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Glycopeptides', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neprilysin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transfection']",2521388,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.050.301.264', 'D23.101.100'], ['D23.050.285'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D13.444.308.425'], ['D09.400.420', 'D12.644.233'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.600', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.600', 'D23.050.285.550', 'D23.101.140.500'], ['C04.557.337.428.600', 'C15.604.515.560.600', 'C20.683.515.528.600'], ['E05.393.183.620.650', 'E05.393.712'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

6244,Ambulatory blood pressure variations relative to sitting or standing position in renal transplant patients.,"OBJECTIVE: High blood pressure is almost constant in renal transplant patients for whom dysautonomia is frequently described. The main objective of this study was to analyse the variations in blood pressure and heart rate recorded by ambulatory measurement during changes in position in renal transplant patients.METHODS: Thirty-nine non-diabetic renal transplant patients with a renal transplant functioning for more than a year, were selected at random. Blood pressure was measured using the validated monitor Diasys Integra with a position sensor to discriminate between standing and sitting/lying.RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly higher when the patient was standing than when sitting/lying (+2.9 mmHg, P<0.05 and +9 beats/min, P<0.001 respectively) and diastolic blood pressure tends to be higher (+1.7 mmHg, NS) when standing. One minute after standing up, the heart rate rises by about 9 beats/min (P<0.001) while systolic and diastolic blood pressures do not vary significantly. Variations in systolic blood pressure and heart rate on changing position are therefore in the same direction as those recorded in elderly normotensive or hypertensive untreated subjects, but with a lower amplitude.CONCLUSIONS: In most of non-diabetic functional renal transplant patients, there is an absence of an orthostatic decline in blood pressure. Thus, it could be considered that there is no real dysautonomia in this specific population.","['Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Renal', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Posture', 'Shy-Drager Syndrome']",15812257,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.370.140.100', 'E01.370.520.500.100'], ['G07.180.562.190'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.777.419.331', 'C13.351.968.419.331', 'C14.907.489.631'], ['E02.870.500', 'E04.936.450.485', 'E04.950.774.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G11.427.695'], ['C10.177.575.550.750', 'C10.228.140.079.612.700', 'C10.228.662.550.700', 'C14.907.514.741']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

14072,18F-FDG uptake for prediction EGFR mutation status in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are a response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, a lack of sufficient tumor tissue has been a limitation for determining EGFR mutation status in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to predict EGFR mutation status in NSCLC patients based on a model including maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and clinical features.We retrospectively reviewed NSCLC patients undergoing EGFR mutation testing and pretreatment positron emission tomography/computed tomography between March 2009 and December 2013. The relationships of EGFR mutations with both SUVmax and patient characteristics were evaluated, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. The model was assessed by area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and was prospectively validated during January to June 2014.Three hundred and sixteen patients meeting the criteria were enrolled for model construction. The SUVmax values were significantly lower for EGFR mutations (mean, 9.5 ± 5.74) than for EGFR wild-type (mean, 12.7 ± 6.43; P < 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that the SUVmax cutoff point was 8.1, for which the AUC was 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.72). In addition, multivariate analysis also showed that low SUVmax (?8.1) was a predictor of EGFR mutations, for which the AUC was 0.77, combining nonsmoking history and primary tumor size (?5 cm). Eighty-five patients were enrolled to validate the predictive model, and the overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 77.6%, 64.6% (95% CI 40.7-82.8), and 82.5% (95% CI 70.9-91.0), respectively.The specific FDG uptake value could be considered to effectively predict EGFR mutation status of NSCLC patients by considering smoking history and primary tumor size when genetic tests are not available.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies']",27472739,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.894.797.520.109.220.249', 'C08.381.540.140.500', 'C08.785.520.100.220.500'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074'], ['D09.254.229.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.370.350.350.800.700.500', 'E01.370.350.350.810.645', 'E01.370.350.567.500', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810.490', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800.399.500', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810.645', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810.723', 'E01.370.350.710.800.399.500', 'E01.370.350.825.800.399.500', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810.700', 'E01.370.384.730.800.399.500'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
655,Executive function impairment in early-treated PKU subjects with normal mental development.,"Executive functions were studied in 14 early and continuously treated PKU subjects (age 10.8 years, range 8-13) in comparison with controls matched for IQ, sex, age and socioeconomic status. Brain MRI examination was normal in all PKU patients. Neuropsychological evaluation included Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure Test, Elithorn's Perceptual Maze Test, Weigl's Sorting Test, Tower of London, Visual Search and Motor Motor Learning Test. Whatever the IQ, PKU subjects performed worse than controls in tests exploring executive functions. Subgrouping the PKU subjects according to the quality of dietary control for the entire follow-up period (using 400 micromol/L as cut-off value for blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration) showed that patients with worse dietary control performed more poorly than both the PKU group with the best dietary control and the control group. However, a mild impairment of executive functions was still found in PKU patients with a good dietary control (Phe <400 micromol/L) compared to controls. Concerning the PKU group as a whole, no linear correlation was found between neuropsychological performance and historical and concurrent biochemical parameters. We conclude that (a) PKU patients, even when treated early, rigorously and continuously, show an impairment of frontal lobe functions; (b) a protracted exposure to moderately high levels of Phe can affect frontal lobe functions independently of the possible effect of the same exposure on IQ; (c) in order to reduce the risk of frontal lobe dysfunction, the target of dietary therapy should be to maintain blood Phe concentration below 400 micromol/L.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Humans', 'Intelligence', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Phenylketonurias', 'Prognosis', 'Social Class']",15159642,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F03.615.250'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.543'], ['F04.711.513'], ['C10.228.140.163.100.687', 'C16.320.565.100.766', 'C16.320.565.189.687', 'C18.452.132.100.687', 'C18.452.648.100.766', 'C18.452.648.189.687'], ['E01.789'], ['I01.880.853.996.755', 'N01.824.782']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
32702,Impact of traumatic and violent victimization experiences in individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.,"Individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ) experience more violent victimization and noninterpersonal traumatic experiences than the general population. Earlier studies, however, have generally excluded one or grouped together victimization and trauma experiences into single outcome variables, which may obscure their contributory role to SZ symptoms. This issue is important because there is some evidence that intentionally induced violence produces higher rates of psychopathology than nonintentional traumatic experiences. We examined the independent contribution of both types of victimization experiences on SZ patients' symptomatology. We were also interested in determining whether SZ patients' pattern of acute symptom presentation could discriminate between SZ patients with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) comorbidity. SZ inpatients (n = 70) were assessed for the presence of comorbid PTSD diagnosis, violent victimization, and noninterpersonal traumatic experiences. Patients were also rated on SZ symptom severity and general psychopathology measures. Past violent victimization experiences predicted severity of dysphoria and anxiety in SZ. Past traumatic experiences, however, predicted severity of psychosis. Victimization predicted severity of patients' autistic/cognitive symptoms. SZ patients with comorbid PTSD presented with significantly more anxiety and dysphoria symptoms and SZ illness chronicity than their non-PTSD counterparts. Discriminant function analysis revealed that the severity of positive, dysphoric, autistic/cognitive, and anxiety symptoms differentiated comorbid PTSD patients from their non-PTSD counterparts, with an overall 72.9% classification rate. Past traumatic and victimization experiences are significantly associated with SZ patients' symptom severity and illness course in partially overlapping domains. Use of common assessment strategies may be employed to increase detection of PTSD in SZ patients presenting for acute treatment.","['Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Comorbidity', 'Crime Victims', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Violence']",20921860,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F03.080'], ['F03.625.164.113.500'], ['F03.615.250'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['M01.135'], ['L01.453.245.945.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.458.410'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['F03.700.675'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F03.700.750'], ['F04.824'], ['F03.950.750.500'], ['I01.198.240.856', 'I01.880.735.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0

23052,Direct Tracking of Particles and Quantification of Margination in Blood Flow.,"Margination refers to the migration of particles toward blood vessel walls during blood flow. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to margination will aid in tailoring the attributes of drug-carrying particles for effective drug delivery. Most previous studies evaluated the margination propensity of these particles via an adhesion mechanism, i.e., by measuring the number of particles that adhered to the channel wall. Although particle adhesion and margination are related, adhesion also depends on other factors. In this study, we quantified the margination propensity of particles of varying diameters (0.53, 0.84, and 2.11 ìm) and apparent wall shear rates (30, 61, and 121 s-1) by directly tracking fluorescent particles flowing through a microfluidic channel. The margination parameter, M, is defined as the total number of particles found within the cell-free layers normalized by the total number of particles that passed through the channel. In this study, an M-value of 0.2 indicated no margination, which was observed for all particle sizes in water. In the case of blood, larger particles were found to have higher M-values and thus marginated more effectively than smaller particles. The corresponding M-values at the device outlet were 0.203, 0.223, and 0.285 for 0.53-, 0.84-, and 2.11-ìm particles, respectively. At the inlet, the M-values for all particle sizes in blood were <0.2, suggesting that non-fully-developed flow and constriction may lead to demargination. For particle velocities transverse to the flow direction (vy), all particle sizes showed a larger standard deviation of vy as well as a higher effective diffusivity when the particles were suspended in blood relative to water. These higher values are attributed to collisions between the blood cells and particles, further supporting recent simulation results. In terms of flow rates, for a given particle size, the higher the flow rate, the higher the M-value.","['Animals', 'Blood', 'Cattle', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hemorheology', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Microfluidics', 'Models, Biological', 'Particle Size', 'Water']",27705771,"[['B01.050'], ['A12.207.152', 'A15.145'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['E05.830.250', 'G09.188.370', 'G09.330.380.630'], ['E07.305.343.500'], ['E05.830.666', 'H01.671.808.500', 'J01.897.520.500.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['G02.712'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
1639,Determination of 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) in human urine by liquid chromatography: direct injection with column switching.,"3TC (GR109714X) is a cytidine dideoxynucleoside analogue which has been shown to have in vitro activity against a variety of strains of HIV-1 and is currently being investigated in clinical trials as a treatment for HIV infection. An HPLC method for the determination of 3TC in human urine has been developed and validated. The method allows direct injection of urine (10 microliters) using HPLC column switching followed by UV detection. On-line extraction is performed using a Spherisorb-SCX (5 microns, 20 x 4.0 mm) eluted with deionized water at 1 ml min-1. 3TC is retained while the bulk of urine constituents are eluted to waste. The SCX column is then backflushed to a BDS-Hypersil-C18 (5 microns, 250 x 4.6 mm) and eluted with 100 mM acetate pH 4.5-methanol (95:5, v/v) for final separation. 3TC is detected by UV absorbance at lambda = 285. The quantitation range of the assay was 0.5-500 micrograms ml-1. The method has demonstrated sufficient ruggedness to be used in support of 3TC clinical trials. Application to other cytidine analogues including DDC has been demonstrated.","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Lamivudine', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Zalcitabine']",8003552,"[['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500.950.500', 'D13.570.230.329.950.500', 'D13.570.230.500.925.500', 'D13.570.685.245.500.950.500'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500.950', 'D13.570.230.329.950', 'D13.570.230.500.925', 'D13.570.685.245.500.950']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
38007,Subarachnoid morphine versus TAP blocks for enhanced recovery after caesarean section delivery: A randomized controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Subarachnoid morphine is widely used for pain relief in enhanced recovery program after cesarean section in spite of its side effects. However, the role of TAP block is still controversial. The aim of our study was to compare the impact of these analgesic techniques (subarachnoid morphine and TAP block) on enhanced recovery after cesarean section.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, we included patients scheduled for cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomized in two groups. Group I: received spinal anesthesia with 100ìg of subarachnoid morphine. Group II: received spinal anesthesia without subarachnoid morphine followed by an ultrasound-guided TAP block. We assessed the time required for mobilization, for re-establishment of gastrointestinal transit and for breast-feeding.RESULTS: TAP block allowed earlier postoperative mobilization. Time required for getting up was significantly lower in group II (9.4h versus 6.9h; P=0.024) as well as time required for walking (12.4h versus 7.4h; P=0.001). TAP block allowed earlier re-establishment of gastrointestinal transit (11.2h in group I versus 8.1h in group II; P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: TAP block seems to be suitable with enhanced recovery programs.","['Abdominal Muscles', 'Adult', 'Analgesics, Opioid', 'Anesthesia Recovery Period', 'Anesthesia, Obstetrical', 'Anesthesia, Spinal', 'Cesarean Section', 'Early Ambulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Morphine', 'Nerve Block', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain, Postoperative', 'Pregnancy', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional', 'Walking']",27080379,"[['A02.633.567.050'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.696.277.600.500', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.760.500', 'D27.505.954.427.040.550.500', 'D27.505.954.427.210.600.500'], ['E03.160', 'E04.614.750.055', 'N02.421.585.753.750.055'], ['E03.155.364'], ['E03.155.086.331'], ['E04.520.252.500'], ['E02.760.169.063.500.335', 'E02.831.335'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.132.577.249.562.571', 'D03.605.497.607.587', 'D03.633.400.686.607.587', 'D04.615.723.795.576.571'], ['E03.155.086.711', 'E04.525.210.550'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['C23.550.767.700', 'C23.888.592.612.832'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E01.370.350.850.855', 'E04.502.890'], ['G11.427.410.568.900', 'G11.427.410.698.277.937', 'I03.350.937', 'I03.450.642.845.940']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

41503,Lower Frequency of HLA-DRB1*01 in Southwestern Iranian Patients with Atherosclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a gene family involved in antigen presentation associated with protection or susceptibility to inflammatory, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which HLA molecules play a role in the initiation and development of the disease through presentation of self or foreign antigens to T cells.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of HLA-DRB1 alleles with atherosclerosis in a sample of southwestern Iranians.METHODS: We performed an analytical cross-sectional study involving 96 patients with atherosclerosis and 72 controls. HLA-DRB1 genotyping was performed by PCR-SSP method.RESULTS: We observed a significantly lower frequency of DRB1*01 in patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis than in controls (4.68% vs. 13.1, P=0.0052, OR=3.09, CI 95%: 1.35-7.05). However, this allele showed a positive association with high blood pressure (P=0.009) in patients. Furthermore, DRB1*16 allele was associated with hyperlipidemia (P=0.008) in patients.CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that DRB1*01 may be a protective allele against atherosclerosis in individuals who live in southwest of Iran. The mechanism of this protection needs further investigation.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Iran', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",30246695,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G12.119', 'G12.450.050.400.070'], ['C14.907.137.126.307'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['G05.330'], ['E05.393.385'], ['G05.380'], ['D12.776.395.550.509.400.440.200.010', 'D12.776.543.550.440.400.440.200.010', 'D23.050.301.500.400.400.440.200.010', 'D23.050.301.500.450.400.440.333.500', 'D23.050.705.552.410.400.440.200.010', 'D23.050.705.552.450.400.440.333.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['Z01.252.245.500.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G05.365.795']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
19772,The role of embolization for hemangiomas.,"We retrospectively studied 31 patients with painful bone (15 patients) and soft-tissue (16 patients) hemangiomas treated with 39 embolizations using N-2-butyl cyanoacrylate from 2003 to 2010. The mean tumor size before embolization was 6 cm for bone and 7 cm for soft-tissue hemangiomas. The technique of embolization was the same for bone and soft-tissue lesions. Preoperative embolization was done in six patients, while the remaining patients had embolization as only treatment. The mean follow-up was 47 months (11-89 months). The clinical and imaging effect of treatment was evaluated at follow-up with a pain score scale, tumor size, and ossification. In four patients, embolization was not feasible because of the inability to catheterize and low blood flow of the feeding vessels. Nine patients with bone and 10 with soft-tissue hemangiomas experienced complete pain relief. Four patients with bone and four with soft-tissue hemangiomas experienced recurrence of pain and were treated with repeat embolization. Re-recurrences were not observed in any of the patients with soft-tissue hemangiomas until the period of this study. Ossification and tumor size reduction were higher for bone hemangiomas. Embolization-related complications were more common for soft-tissue hemangiomas.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Enbucrilate', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fractures, Compression', 'Fractures, Spontaneous', 'Hemangioma', 'Humans', 'Humeral Fractures', 'Laminectomy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain Management', 'Preoperative Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Spinal Fractures', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Tissue Adhesives', 'Tumor Burden', 'Young Adult']",22684541,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.149', 'C05.116.231'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E02.186'], ['E02.520.360', 'E02.926.500'], ['D02.241.081.069.366.350', 'D02.626.290.350', 'D05.750.259.341', 'D25.720.259.341', 'D25.919.367.341', 'J01.637.051.720.259.341', 'J01.637.051.919.367.341'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C26.404.195'], ['C26.404.374'], ['C04.557.645.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C26.088.390', 'C26.404.500'], ['E02.718.563', 'E04.188.400', 'E04.525.450', 'E04.555.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.745', 'N04.590.607.500'], ['E02.760.795', 'E04.604.750', 'N02.421.585.795'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C04.588.839'], ['C26.117.500.500', 'C26.404.812'], ['E04.555.100.700'], ['D25.919', 'D27.720.102.919', 'E07.858.690.860', 'J01.637.051.919'], ['E05.041.124.892'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
44927,Wogonin modulates hydroperoxide-induced apoptosis via PI3K/Akt pathway in retinal pigment epithelium cells.,"BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress causes the defects of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that contribute to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study was conducted to determine whether wogonin could prevent H2O2-induced oxidative stress in RPE cells.METHODS: A RPE cell line, ARPE-19, was obtained for the cell model. ARPE-19 cells were pre-treated with various concentrations of wogonin for 24 h before being exposed to H2O2 for 2 h to induce oxidative stress. Cell metabolic activity was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cellular apoptosis was quantified by the flow cytometry. Protein level was assed by western blot.RESULTS: The RPE cells exposed to to 200 mM H2O2 demonstrated a significant depression in the cell viability; whereas pre-treatment with 50 and 100 mmol/l wogonin could significantly improve the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The proportion of PI-positive cells was increased significantly in RPE cells treated with H2O2 alone; whereas pretreatment with 100 mM wogonin significantly reduced H2O2 -induced RPE cell death rate. In protein level, the wogonin use could reduce the level of p-Akt significantly and this is the possible mechanism of the antioxidant effect of wogonin.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that wogonin pre-treatment can protect RPE cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis. This suggests potential effect of wogonin in the prevention of retinal diseases associated with H2O2-induced oxidative stress such as AMD.VIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/13000_2014_154.","['Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytoprotection', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Flavanones', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium', 'Signal Transduction']",25432585,"[['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G04.346'], ['G07.690.773.500'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['A11.436'], ['D03.383.663.283.266.450.252', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.252'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.424', 'D01.339.431.374.424', 'D01.650.550.750.400', 'D02.389.338.253'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.500.100'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.755', 'D12.776.476.565', 'D12.776.624.664.700.168'], ['A09.371.670.500', 'A09.371.729.887'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18065,Efficient Synthesis of a Wide-Range Absorbing Azaphthalocyanine Dark Quencher and Its Application to Dual-Labeled Oligonucleotide Probes for Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reactions.,"Unsymmetrical dialkylamino-substituted zinc azaphthalocyanine (AzaPc) exhibits unique spectral and photophysical properties for dark quenchers of fluorescence in DNA hybridization probes. The panchromatic light absorption of AzaPc from 300 nm up to at least 700 nm and its lack of fluorescence make it an ideal candidate for a universal dark quencher. To prove this experimentally, oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes were labeled at the 3'-end by this AzaPc and at the 5'-end by a fluorophore used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-that is, fluorescein, CAL Fluor Red 610, and Cy5. AzaPc showed a significantly higher quenching efficiency compared to the commercially available dark quenchers (BHQ-1, BHQ-2, BBQ-650) in a developed model of TaqMan PCR assay. The AzaPc-labeled probe proved to also be useful in a practical PCR assay for the quantification of the SLCO2B1 transporter gene expression. The constructed calibration curves indicated linearity in the range from 102 to 107 of target copies.","['DNA Probes', 'Fluorescein', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",29683215,"[['D13.444.600.223', 'D27.505.259.750.600.223', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223'], ['D02.455.426.779.347.390', 'D03.633.300.953.275.390', 'D04.711.347.390'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['D13.695.578.424.450'], ['D13.444.600.601', 'D27.505.259.750.600.650', 'D27.720.470.530.600.650'], ['E05.393.620.500.706']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25467,Effects of PTEN inhibition on regulation of tau phosphorylation in an okadaic acid-induced neurodegeneration model.,"One of pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of tau hyperphosphorylation remain largely unclear. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, however, potential functions and role of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in AD pathogenesis have not been fully explored. Here, we report that okadaic acid (OA)-induced tau phosphorylation is accompanied by PTEN induction, knockdown of PTEN reduces the tau hyperphosphorylation by OA in SH-SY5Y cells and increases cell proliferation and survival. The effect of PTEN suppression on tau dephosphorylation appeared to be mediated by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 while enhancing the Akt activity. Reduction of tau phosphorylation was also observed in the OA-induced parental SH-SY5Y cells co-treated with bisperoxovanadate (bpv), a potent PTEN inhibitor. Our studies provide evidence for an effect of PTEN on the phosphorylation of tau in AD pathogenesis and give some insight into the mechanisms through which suppression of PTEN expression may contribute towards the amelioration of tauopathy, implying that pharmacological intervention of PTEN may be a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Okadaic Acid', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'tau Proteins']",22906543,"[['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.346'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['G05.308.370'], ['D05.500.117.875', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.429.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.625', 'D12.644.360.300.500', 'D12.776.476.081.875', 'D12.776.476.300.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.543'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.590.650.550', 'C04.557.470.670.590.650.550', 'C04.557.580.625.600.590.650.550'], ['D02.355.291.705', 'D23.946.580.710'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.850', 'D12.776.476.590', 'D12.776.624.776.695'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['D12.776.220.600.450.510', 'D12.776.631.560.510']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3695,A 23-year review of the management of acute retention of urine: progressing or regressing?,"A retrospective review of all patients in Oxford under the care of one consultant urologist (GJF) who presented on alternate years over a 23-year period with acute retention of urine was undertaken. Data were collected on the: (i) number of patients discharged from hospital with an in-dwelling catheter; (ii) duration of catheter drainage prior to surgery; and (iii) duration of postoperative stay. In all, 244 patients underwent prostatectomy. Over the 23-year period, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients discharged prior to surgery (P < 0.001) as well as their median duration of catheterisation (P < 0.001): more than 50% were catheterised for more than 3 months in 1997. Conversely, post-operative hospital stay has decreased. Prolonged catheter drainage carries considerable morbidity, with 72% experiencing some complication. Most patients feel they lose dignity, 69% consider it uncomfortable and more than 50% complain of burning sensations, bladder spasms and a persistent desire to micturate. We recommend that patients should not be placed on routine waiting lists where they are liable to remain for an unacceptably long time. Targets should be set to admit them within a set period and theatre lists made available. We feel that six weeks is a realistic target.","['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Catheters, Indwelling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medical Audit', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary Retention', 'Waiting Lists']",11041033,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E07.132.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.761.700.250.500', 'N05.700.175.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.950.774.860.625'], ['C12.294.565.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.370.390.820', 'E02.148.947', 'E05.157.500'], ['C12.777.934.880', 'C13.351.968.934.880'], ['N04.452.095.738']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
5001,Mechanism of hypertensive nephropathy in the Dahl/Rapp rat: a primary disorder of vascular smooth muscle.,"The Dahl/Rapp salt-sensitive (S) rat is a model of salt-sensitive hypertension and hypertensive renal disease. This study explored the role of vascular remodeling in the development of renal failure in S rats. Groups of S and Sprague-Dawley rats were given 0.3 and 8.0% NaCl diets for up to 21 days and evidence of smooth muscle proliferation identified using immunohistochemistry that showed nuclear accumulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine. Compared with the other three groups, S rats on 8.0% NaCl diet showed increased nuclear labeling of cells of the aorta and arteries and arterioles of the kidney by the end of the first week of study. Progressive luminal narrowing of the interlobular arteries and preglomerular arterioles occurred in S rats over the 3 wk on the 8.0% NaCl diet. Accumulation of pimonidazole adducts and nuclear accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) were used as markers of tissue hypoxia. By the end of the second week of study, pimonidazole levels increased in S rats on 8.0% NaCl diet and deposition was apparent in tubular cells in the cortex and medulla. At the completion of the experiment, HIF-1alpha levels were increased in nuclear extracts from the cortex and medulla of S rats on this diet, compared with the other three groups of rats. The data demonstrated a disorder of the vascular remodeling process with proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells temporally followed by development of tissue hypoxia in the hypertensive nephropathy of S rats on 8.0% NaCl diet.","['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', 'Kidney', 'Male', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular', 'Nitroimidazoles', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Dahl', 'Renal Insufficiency', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Sucrose', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors']",15583217,"[['B01.050'], ['D03.383.742.680.852.300.150', 'D13.570.230.430.196', 'D13.570.685.852.300.150'], ['G03.197.300', 'G04.270.300'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['C14.907.489'], ['D12.776.260.103.625.750', 'D12.776.930.125.625.750'], ['A05.810.453'], ['A02.633.570.491', 'A07.015.733.500', 'A10.690.467.491'], ['D02.640.672', 'D03.383.129.308.658'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.165', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.165'], ['C12.777.419.780', 'C13.351.968.419.780'], ['D01.210.450.150.875', 'D01.857.650'], ['D09.698.629.305.770', 'D09.947.750.770'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15279,Corticopontine projection in the guinea pig. Electron microscopic study.,"Guinea pigs were subjected to unilateral thermocoagulation of the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortex, and were allowed to survive 4 and 7 days. Routine electron microscopic technique was employed to examine orthograde degenerative changes in the ipsilateral pontine nuclei. Following four days survival the degenerating corticofugal synaptic boutons (d.s.b.) exhibited features attributed to all three basic degeneration types: dark, filamentous, and light. Most of the synaptic boutons arising in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortex display filamentous degenerative changes, and measure approximately 3 micrometers. The temporopontine axons terminate as dark d.s.b. Also, some d.s.b. following frontal ablation (collaterals of the corticospinal tract?), and a small number of occipitopontine d.s.b. (visual associative cortex?), develop dark degenerative changes. Most of the dark d.s.b. measure less than 2 micrometer. The light d.s.b., with mean diameter 2 micrometer, are rarely found following frontal and occipital lesions. Following 7 days survival almost exclusively dark d.s.b. are to be observed--a great part of them, apparently, representing the late stage of the evolution of the filamentous and light degeneration.

12973,"Enhancement of BALB/c 3T3 cells transformation by 1,2-dibromoethane promoting effect.","Two of the most representative halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, were tested in the two-stage cell transformation model for analysing the promoting ability. Both of these compounds had previously been found to exert genotoxic effects, probably acting as moderate initiators. BALB/c 3T3 cells were initiated with subtransforming doses of N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or 3-methylcholanthrene and then exposed to a chronic treatment with different non-transforming dosages of the two haloalkanes. 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane did not exert any promoting activity in that system. By contrast, significant promoting effects by 1,2-dibromoethane were observed both in cells treated with N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and in cells treated with 3-methylcholanthrene. Promotion of the transformation process initiated with 3-methylcholanthrene was detectable when confluent cells in the chemical-treated plates were replated in the level-II amplification test. This experimental procedure allowed cells to perform further rounds of replications and transformed foci to became detectable. Results gave evidence for a promoting role of 1,2-dibromoethane in multistep carcinogenesis, probably responsible for the higher oncogenic ability of this compound with respect to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane.","['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethane', 'Ethylene Dibromide', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine', 'Mice', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",8625443,"[['A11.251.210.100', 'A11.329.228.100'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.888.569.100'], ['C04.697.098.500', 'C23.550.727.098.500'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D02.455.326.146.379'], ['D02.455.526.368.225'], ['D02.455.526.439'], ['D02.078.370.649.400', 'D02.654.567.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D02.455.849.291.500.510.850']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
556,The Early Postoperative Effects of Cochlear Implantation on Horizontal Semicircular Canal Function.,"OBJECTIVES: To use video head impulse testing to examine the effect of cochlear implantation (CI) on horizontal SCC vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain early after surgery, and to relate outcomes to subjective imbalance.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.SETTING: Academic tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Thirty-seven (23F:14M) adult cochlear implant recipients (mean age, 55; age range, 20-80).INTERVENTION: Cochlear implantation.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The VOR of the horizontal semicircular canal of both the operated and non-operated ears was examined using video head impulse testing before surgery and at days 1, 7, and 28 following surgery. VOR gain, VOR gain asymmetry, and the change in VOR gain from preoperative baseline where the primary outcome measures. Subjective imbalance was assessed using a structured questionnaire.RESULTS: VOR gain value for the operated ear was 0.88 ± 0.21. Mean VOR gain on day 1 postoperatively was 0.86 ± 0.19; on day 7, 0.87 ± 0.17, and on day 30, 0.91 ± 0.21. Before surgery median asymmery was -5.50%, on day 1 it was -5.30%, at day 7, -6.44%, and at day 30 it was -2.61%. There was no significant difference between these measures for the cohort across the four time points. Thirteen of 37 (35%) of patients experienced imbalance in the follow-up period, but this was not correlated to changes in VOR gain.CONCLUSION: Horizontal semicircular canal function is preserved in the immediate and early postoperative period. This suggests that horizontal semicircular canal impairment is not likely to be responsible for postoperative imbalance.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Female', 'Head Impulse Test', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Postural Balance', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reflex, Vestibulo-Ocular', 'Semicircular Canals', 'Sensation Disorders', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",29995005,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E04.580.450.220', 'E04.650.220'], ['E07.305.250.319.381.500.500', 'E07.695.150', 'E07.695.202.381.500.500', 'E07.814.458.150'], ['E01.370.382.900.640'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E04.614.750', 'N02.421.585.753.750'], ['F02.830.816.541.752', 'G07.888.750.500', 'G11.427.690', 'G11.561.790.541.595'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['G07.888.937', 'G11.561.731.795'], ['A09.246.300.663'], ['C10.597.751', 'C23.888.592.763'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
18583,Validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire for the Spondyloarthropathies.,"The Health Assessment Questionnaire for Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) was built by adding five new questions related with cervical and lumbar spine functions to HAQ by Daltroy et al. (in J Rheumatol 17(7):946-945, 1990). The aim of this study was to adapt the added five items into Turkish and then to test its reliability and validity. New questions were adapted to Turkish according to 'translation-back translation' method. Seventy-nine patients with ankylosing spondylitis were asked with the Turkish version of HAQ-S (HAQ-S TV). To assess, construct validity patients were evaluated by HAQ, Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI), Maastricht AS Enthesitis Score (MASES), Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL), and laboratory variables (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein). Construct validity was investigated with Spearmann's rank correlation coefficient. Reliability of HAQ-S TV was assessed by internal consistency. Inter- and intra-observer reliability were tested with Cronbach's alpha score. HAQ-S TV met set criteria of reliability and validity. Reliability of adapted version was found good with high internal consistency value. (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89). In addition to this intra-observer and inter-observer reliability were found adequate for total score of HAQ-S (Cronbach's alphas: 0.999 and 0.998 in order) and also for each added five questions (Cronbach's alphas >0.7). Positive correlations were found between HAQ-S TV and HAQ, BASFI, BASDAI, BASMI, MASES, ASQoL, ESR, and CRP (P < 0.05). The results of this study showed that HAQ-S TV was reliable and valid in patients with AS.","['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Sedimentation', 'C-Reactive Protein', 'Cervical Vertebrae', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Spondylarthropathies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Translating', 'Turkey', 'Young Adult']",21327435,"[['E02.760.169.063.500.067', 'E02.831.067', 'I03.050', 'N02.421.784.110'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D23.101'], ['E01.370.225.625.125', 'E05.200.625.125'], ['D12.776.034.145', 'D12.776.124.050.120', 'D12.776.124.486.157'], ['A02.835.232.834.151'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['C05.116.900.853.625.800', 'C05.550.114.865.800'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['L01.559.423.796'], ['Z01.252.245.500.850'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
23765,Fenofibrate increases serum creatinine in a patient with familial nephropathy associated to hyperuricemia.,"BACKGROUND: Kidney function progressively deteriorates in patients with familial juvenile hyperuricemiac nephropathy (FJHN, OMIN 162000) and chronic renal disease is commonly associated to dyslipidemia. We report for the first time abrupt renal insufficiency in a patient with FJHN and hypertrygliceridemia following fenofibrate administration.CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old man was diagnosed clinically with FJHN at age 24 years which was subsequently confirmed by genotypic analysis of the UMOD gene at age 40 years. His mother and two brothers suffered the disease. At that time, renal size and function were normal, as was his blood pressure and serum lipids. At age 34 years, serum urate was 8.5 mg/dL and creatinine 1.7 mg/dL (GFR, 58 mL/min/1.73 m2). He was treated with allopurinol, losartan, and lovastatin. Serum TG levels ranged between 150 and 250 mg/dL. At age 52 years, serum urate was 4.1 mg/dL, creatinine 3.2 mg/dL, LDLc 99 mg/dL (atorvastatin 40 mg/d), and TG 275 mg/dL. Fenofibrate (160 mg/d) was added. One month later, serum creatinine increased to 4.2 mg/dL and TG decreased to 125 mg/dL. He did not complain of muscle pain, weakness, or changes in urinary frequency or color and rabdomyolysis was discarded. Fenofibrate was withheld and three months later serum creatinine decreased to baseline levels (3.2 mg/dL) and TG increased to 197 mg/dL.CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first patient with FJHN in whom fenofibrate administration was associated to a further impairment in renal function not attributable to rabdomyolysis.","['Adult', 'Creatinine', 'Female', 'Fenofibrate', 'Gout', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Young Adult']",24940667,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['D02.241.081.114.968.500.625', 'D02.355.726.305.625', 'D02.455.426.559.389.134.750', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.654.305.625', 'D02.522.223.750'], ['C05.550.114.423', 'C05.550.354.500', 'C05.799.414', 'C16.320.565.798.368', 'C18.452.648.798.368'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452.584.500.500.851'], ['C23.550.449'], ['A05.810.453'], ['C12.777.419', 'C13.351.968.419'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.760.952', 'N02.421.585.952'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
26687,"HY5, Circadian Clock-Associated 1, and a cis-element, DET1 dark response element, mediate DET1 regulation of chlorophyll a/b-binding protein 2 expression.","DET1 is a pleiotropic regulator of Arabidopsis development and controls the expression of many light-regulated genes. To gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which DET1 controls transcription from light-regulated promoters, we identified elements in the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein 2 (CAB2) promoter that are required for DET1-mediated expression. Using a series of reporter constructs in which the luciferase gene is controlled by CAB2 promoter fragments, we defined two DET1-responsive elements in the CAB2 promoter that are essential for proper CAB2 transcription. A 40-bp DET1 dark-response element (DtRE) is required for both dark and root-specific repression of CAB2, whereas the known CAB upstream factor-1 element is required for DET1 activation-associated effects in the light and repression in the roots. HY5, a factor that binds CAB upstream factor-1, is also required for DET1 effects in the light. DtRE binds two distinct activities in Arabidopsis seedling extracts: a novel activity with binding site CAAAACGC that we have named CAB2 DET1-associated factor 1 plus an activity that is likely to be the myb transcription factor Circadian Clock-Associated 1. Both activities are altered in dark-grown det1 extracts as compared with wild type, correlating a change in extractable DNA binding activity with a major change in CAB2 expression. We conclude that DET1 represses the CAB2 promoter in the dark by regulating the binding of two factors, CAB2 DET1-associated factor 1 and Circadian Clock-Associated 1, to the DtRE.","['Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Coleoptera', 'Darkness', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Light', 'Luciferases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors']",14563928,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.157.100'], ['D12.776.765.149'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D12.776.260.108', 'D12.776.930.127'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['G07.180.562.190'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.375'], ['G01.590.540.233'], ['G05.308.375'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.435'], ['D12.644.360', 'D12.776.476'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['D08.811.682.517', 'D12.776.532.510'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.776.660'], ['B01.650.520', 'B05.620.600'], ['E05.393.751'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Prostates from a group of younger individuals only showed a patchy distribution of the MCAR at the epithelium of the acini.

41507,A study of goat SRY protein expression suggests putative new roles for this gene in the developing testis of a species with long-lasting SRY expression.,"The testis-determining gene SRY is not well-conserved among mammals, and particularly between mouse and other mammals. To evaluate SRY function in a nonrodent species, we produced an antibody against goat SRY and used it to investigate the expression pattern of SRY throughout goat testicular development. By contrast with the mouse, SRY is primarily expressed in most cells of XY genital-ridges and not solely in pre-Sertoli cells. Between cord formation and prepuberty, SRY remains expressed in both Sertoli and germinal cells. During adulthood, SRY expression declines and then disappears from meiotic germ cells, only remaining present at low levels in some spermatogonia. Unlike the germinal lineage, SRY continues to be highly expressed in adult Sertoli cells with a typical nuclear staining. Our data indicate that in goat, the role of SRY may not be limited to testis determination and could have other functions in testicular maintenance and hence male fertility.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Goats', 'Male', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sertoli Cells', 'Sex Differentiation', 'Sex-Determining Region Y Protein', 'Spermatogonia', 'Testis']",20941779,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A11.251.210.172.500', 'A11.329.228.220'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.126.110'], ['G05.308.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.513'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['A05.360.444.849.789', 'A11.382.952', 'A11.436.837'], ['G07.345.500.325.377.843', 'G07.345.750.500', 'G08.686.841.500'], ['D12.776.260.719.049', 'D12.776.660.235.400.750.049', 'D12.776.664.235.400.750.049', 'D12.776.930.823.049'], ['A05.360.490.890.900', 'A11.497.760.800'], ['A05.360.444.849', 'A05.360.576.782', 'A06.300.312.782']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
17788,Influence of streaming potential on the transport and separation of charged spherical solutes in nanochannels subjected to particle-wall interactions.,"In this work, we theoretically investigate the implications of streaming potential on the transport and size-based separation of charged solutes in nanoscale confinements. By employing a regular perturbation analysis, we demonstrate that the consideration of streaming potential establishes a new paradigm of size-based separation of charged solutes in nanochannels. Depending on the sizes of the particles being handled, we establish two distinctive separation regimes. For smaller particles with significantly large electrophoretic mobilities, electrophoretic transport mechanisms predominantly influence the solutal transport characteristics, whereas for larger particles the combined pressure-driven and back electroosmotic transport mechanisms essentially dictate the resultant separation characteristics. The extent of improvement in separation characteristics, on account of the consideration of streaming effect, largely depends on the consideration of particle-wall interactions. For cases without wall effects, the streaming potential may induce dramatic enhancements in the resolution of separation for small particles by exploiting optimal combinations of zeta potential values and relative thicknesses of the electrical double layers. However, with wall effect considerations, similar combinations of zeta potential and electrical double-layer thicknesses may give rise to dramatic improvements in the separation characteristics over a much wider range of particle sizes by interacting nontrivially with the streaming potential effects. Such confluences may be exploited in practice for designing efficient nanofluidic separation systems.","['Adsorption', 'Electrochemistry', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Statistical', 'Nanoparticles', 'Nanotechnology', 'Osmosis', 'Particle Size', 'Pressure', 'Solutions', 'Surface Properties', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",19618905,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['H01.181.529.307'], ['E05.830.666', 'H01.671.808.500', 'J01.897.520.500.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.666.400', 'E05.595.666.400'], ['E05.599.495'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['H01.603', 'J01.897.520.600'], ['G01.154.090.750', 'G02.111.655', 'G02.691', 'G02.723.495'], ['G02.712'], ['G01.374.715'], ['D26.776'], ['G02.860'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0

14514,Recombinant interleukin-2-activated intracavitary lymphocytes: phenotypic characteristics and effector function.,"A preclinical study of intracavitary lymphocytes (ICL) from malignant effusions of cancer patients is described. The object of this study was to evaluate the antitumor potential of ICL as a baseline for developing adoptive immunotherapy trial for ovarian carcinoma patients. The main parameters studied were functional cytolytic activity of fresh and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-activated ICL and their phenotypic characteristics. Spontaneous cytolytic activity of ICL was detected in all samples tested against natural killer (NK)-sensitive targets (K562), while very low activity was shown against NK-resistant targets (Daudi) and fresh tumor cells. Activation in culture with rIL-2 generated cytolytic activity against NK-resistant targets and significantly augmented NK activity. The pattern of antitumor lytic activity of ICL resembles lymphokine-activated killer cell activity and is non-major histocompatibility complex restricted against a variety of tumor targets. Phenotypic characterization of fresh ICL showed the predominance of CD3+ cells with the CD4/CD8 ratio resembling that of peripheral blood lymphocytes. During culture with rIL-2, changes in phenotypic expression of activated ICL were detected: enrichment in NKH1+ cells (up to 65%), of CD8+ (up to 70%), and very late antigen (VLA)-1+ cells (up to 54%), concomitantly with a decrease in CD4+ population. The NKH1, CD8, and VLA-1 expression peaked at 2 weeks in culture and coincided with peak cytolytic activity of cultured ICL. Depletion of CD8+ cells from activated ICL resulted in a decreased proportion of cells expressing the NKH1 and VLA-1 phenotype, whereas depletion CD4+ cells led to enrichment in CD8, NKH1, and VLA-1 antigens. Cytolytic activity was significantly increased in CD4 depleted population against NK-resistant and NK-sensitive targets. In this study we found that rIL-2 activation and culture of ICL generates killer activity against NK-resistant and fresh tumor targets and that enrichment in expression of NKH1, CD8, and VLA-1 antigens is associated with effector function.","['Antigens, Surface', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Exudates and Transudates', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2787838,"[['D23.050.301'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['A11.251'], ['G12.287'], ['A12.383'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.021', 'D12.644.276.374.480.372', 'D12.776.467.374.465.021', 'D12.776.467.374.480.372', 'D23.529.374.465.155', 'D23.529.374.480.372'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['G05.695'], ['D12.776.828']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4312,The Parental Schoolwork Support Measure-Youth: development and psychometric evaluation.,"Parental involvement in school-related tasks is associated with a number of positive outcomes across ethnic groups. However, a growing literature suggests that unique forms of involvement and barriers exist among linguistic minority Latino families. The Parental Schoolwork Support Measure-Youth (PSSM-Y) is introduced in this study along with the psychometric properties found with a sample of 133 Latino youth in Grades 5 through 7 from a public school in a low-income urban neighborhood. Exploratory factor analyses indicated the presence of three factors called direct support, language and support, and indirect support, which together accounted for 66.3% of the common variance in the 16-item version. Strong internal consistency and test-retest coefficients were found for the PSSM-Y in this sample. In addition, schoolwork support was correlated with youth depression, economic pressure, loneliness, and familism in the expected directions. The findings are discussed in terms of the potential utility of this measure for future school-based studies of Latino students and youth of immigrant backgrounds in the United States.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Poverty Areas', 'Psychometrics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Schools', 'Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Students', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States', 'Urban Population']",22686144,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E05.318.740.400', 'N05.715.360.750.350', 'N06.850.520.830.400'], ['M01.686.754.441'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.263.370.290'], ['F01.829.263.500.320', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340', 'M01.620'], ['I01.880.853.996.535.550', 'N01.824.600.550'], ['F04.711.780'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['N01.224.791', 'N06.850.505.400.800'], ['I02.783', 'J03.832'], ['I01.880.853.500.600'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['M01.848'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['N01.600.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

We present the Mars-500 experiment, which took place in Moscow, Russia, over 520 d from June 5, 2010, to November 4, 2011. It was designed to simulate a 250-d interplanetary mission from Earth to Mars, a 30-d orbital stay with a Mars landing, and a 240-d interplanetary mission from Mars back to Earth. The six-person crew was composed of three Russians, two Europeans, and one Chinese.METHODS: We applied the ethological method based on observation, description, and quantification of nonverbal behavior expressed by actions and interactions, as well as verbal behavior expressed through positions and communications. These events were scored with The Observer XT software from video recordings made every 2 wk during a daily life activity at breakfast time and every month during a group discussion task.RESULTS: We show that the frequency of occurrences of personal actions, visual interactions, facial expressions and collateral acts are linked to certain phases, periods, and temporal points of the mission. Verbal communications in English and in Russian involve prevalent language associated with place preferences and preferential relationships among the crewmembers.DISCUSSION: We found evidence that the Mars-500 crew behavior was dependent on time, culture, and the individual.","['Adult', 'Communication', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Culture', 'Ecological Systems, Closed', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Russia', 'Space Flight']",24261062,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.145.209', 'L01.143'], ['I01.076.201.450.281', 'I01.880.853.100.257'], ['I01.076.201.450', 'I01.880.853.100'], ['G16.500.275.157.240', 'N06.230.124.240', 'N06.230.150.225'], ['E05.318.740.400', 'N05.715.360.750.350', 'N06.850.520.830.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.122.500', 'Z01.542.248.775'], ['J01.937.285.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
1284,A case-management program of medium intensity does not improve cardiovascular risk factor control in coronary artery disease patients: the Heartcare I trial.,"BACKGROUND: Case-management programs for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease that utilize extensive resources can reduce cardiovascular risk factors, but less intensive approaches have failed to show benefits. This randomized trial evaluated whether a medium intensity case-management program improves risk factor control in patients with coronary artery disease.METHODS: We assigned 201 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute coronary events in the intensive care unit of University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, to either a risk factor case-management program (n = 99) or care as usual (n = 102) using the patients' primary care physicians as the unit of randomization (cluster randomization). The case-management program consisted of an hour of counseling by a clinician during hospitalization and two short reminders by phone and mail 3 and 6 months later. Treatment decisions were left to patients and their primary care physicians.RESULTS: After 9 and 18 months of follow-up, there were no significant differences in lipid values, blood pressure control, fasting blood glucose, body-mass index, or number of smokers between the two groups. However, significantly more patients in the intervention group than in the care as usual group achieved target cholesterol values after 18 months (48% versus 27%, P = 0.002 and remained significant after Bonferroni-Holms correction) but not after 9 months of follow-up (31% versus 27%, P >0.2).CONCLUSION: This hospital-based case-management and outreach program, limited to counseling by a clinician, did not substantially improve cardiovascular risk factor control among patients hospitalized for coronary events.","['Blood Pressure', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case Management', 'Cholesterol', 'Coronary Disease', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Risk Factors']",11343668,"[['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['N04.590.233.624.250'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197', 'D10.570.938.208'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.458'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
27242,Isolated tibial polyethylene insert exchange outcomes after total knee arthroplasty.,"UNLABELLED: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a modular design allows isolated tibial polyethylene insert exchange (ITPIE) as a treatment option for isolated polyethylene failure. We asked whether ITPIE in selected patients would provide high survivorship and identified factors predicting success or failure. We retrospectively reviewed 42 patients (42 knees) who underwent ITPIE for instability, stiffness, or aseptic effusions after TKA. All patients had well-aligned and well-fixed components documented by radiographs and intraoperative evaluation. We determined whether patients had been revised and evaluated unrevised patients using the Knee Society rating system. The minimum followup was 2 years (average, 5.6 years; range, 2-11 years). Twelve patients (29%) underwent subsequent revision of their ITPIE (58% survivorship at 11 years). Average time to revision was 3 years. Although mean Knee Society scores improved, nine of the 30 unrevised patients (30%) had persistent pain at followup. Time from index TKA to ITPIE was associated with outcome; ITPIE less than 3 years from index TKA was 3.8 times more likely to undergo rerevision than ITPIE more than 3 years from index TKA. ITPIE for failed TKA is associated with unpredictable outcomes. ITPIE, even with well-defined and narrow indications, should be undertaken with caution. The longer the initial components performed successfully before ITPIE, the greater the likelihood of success after ITPIE.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

19364,Utilization of fermented barley extract obtained from a by-product of barley shochu for nisin production.,"Fermented barley extract (FBE) obtained from a barley shochu by-product (shochu kasu) and its ethanol fractions were evaluated as a medium and supplement, respectively, for nisin A production by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454. A Brix 2.5 FBE medium supplemented with glucose provided a high level of nisin A production with a nisin yield comparable to that from a nutritionally rich laboratory medium (basal medium). By adding the ethanol-insoluble (EI) fraction of FBE to the basal medium, nisin A production was enhanced concomitant with an increase in bacterial cell growth, while the ethanol-soluble (ES) fraction had a negative effect on nisin A production. These findings indicate that FBE obtained from shochu kasu can be utilized as a preferable medium for nisin A production and could be converted into a value-added food product having preservative functions. The procedure developed in this study would promote recycling of shochu kasu.","['Bioreactors', 'Culture Media', 'Ethanol', 'Fermentation', 'Glucose', 'Hordeum', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactates', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lactococcus lactis', 'Nisin', 'Solubility', 'Temperature']",19000617,"[['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['D02.033.375'], ['G02.111.158.249', 'G03.191.249'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.481'], ['G02.300'], ['D02.241.511.459'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['B03.353.750.737.500.400', 'B03.510.400.800.500.400', 'B03.510.550.737.500.400'], ['D04.345.566.582', 'D12.644.641.582', 'D12.776.097.151.700', 'D12.776.543.695.110.700'], ['G02.805'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
7651,Risk indicators for tooth wear in Sri Lankan adolescents.,"The aim of the study was to determine the risk indicators for tooth wear in Sri Lankan adolescents. A total of 1,200 17-year-olds were selected using a two-stage cluster sampling technique from schools in the Colombo district. The data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire and a clinical examination. A modified version of Smith and Knight's index of tooth wear was used to record tooth wear on occlusal/incisal, buccal and lingual/palatal surfaces of teeth excluding the third molars. Tooth wear was present in 22% of the adolescents, while nearly 9% had at least 1 wear lesion extending up to the dentine. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the consumption of Coca Cola(R) (OR: 2.60; 95% CI: 1.41-4.78), apples (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.04-2.58), the father's occupation (OR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.29-3.74) and chewing vitamin C tablets (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.03-2.75) were significantly associated with dentinal wear, while tooth wear was associated with the consumption of oranges (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.09-2.37) and apples (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.06-1.80), the father's occupation (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.22-2.68) and chewing vitamin C tablets (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.04-2.00). As the father's occupation could be considered as a proxy measure of socioeconomic status, the findings suggest that tooth wear in Sri Lankan adolescents is a disorder of affluence.","['Adolescent', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Carbonated Beverages', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Dentin', 'Fathers', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Malus', 'Occupations', 'Oral Hygiene', 'Physical Examination', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Class', 'Sri Lanka', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tooth Wear', 'Toothbrushing', 'Vitamins']",20068303,"[['M01.060.057'], ['D02.241.081.844.107', 'D02.241.511.902.107', 'D09.811.100'], ['G07.203.100.300', 'J02.200.300'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.875.177.769'], ['A14.549.167.900.280'], ['F01.829.263.500.320.100', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340.210', 'M01.620.390'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.444'], ['N01.824.547'], ['E02.547.600', 'E06.761.726'], ['E01.370.600'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['I01.880.853.996.755', 'N01.824.782'], ['Z01.252.245.840', 'Z01.639.520.875'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['C07.793.818'], ['E06.761.726.794'], ['D27.505.696.494.600', 'G07.203.300.681.500.600', 'J02.500.681.500.600']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
39917,Multiple-center study of reduced-concentration triamcinolone topical solution for the treatment of dogs with known or suspected allergic pruritus.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of triamcinolone acetonide topical solution (TTS) in dogs for use in reduction of clinical signs of pruritic inflammatory skin diseases of a known or suspected allergic basis and to evaluate adverse effects associated with TTS administration.ANIMALS: 103 pruritic adult dogs with known or suspected allergic skin disease.PROCEDURE: Dogs were treated for 4 weeks with TTS or with vehicle solution (control dogs) in a multiple-center study. Clinical signs were scored by owners and by examining veterinarians before and after treatment. Blood samples obtained before and after treatment were subjected to routine hematologic and serum biochemical analyses.RESULTS: Treatment success, as defined by an improvement of at least 2 of 6 grades in overall clinical score, was evident in 35 of 52 (67%) TTS-treated dogs (mean improvement, 1.98) and 12 of 51 (24%) control dogs (mean improvement, 0.29). For several criteria, TTS was significantly more effective than vehicle in reducing clinical signs. Minor alterations in hematologic determinations in TTS-treated dogs were limited to slightly lower total leukocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts after treatment. Minor adverse effects were reported by owners in 6 of 52 (12%) TTS-treated and 9 of 51 (18%) control dogs.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Triamcinolone used as a spray solution at a concentration approximately one-sixth the concentration of triamcinolone topical preparations currently available for veterinary use is effective for short-term alleviation of allergic pruritus in dogs. Adverse effects are few and mild and, thus, do not preclude prolonged treatment with the solution.","['Administration, Topical', 'Animals', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Pruritus', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide']",11911576,"[['E02.319.267.120'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.124.100', 'E05.200.124.100'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['D06.472.040.543', 'D27.505.696.399.472.488'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595', 'E05.200.625.107.595', 'E05.242.195.107.595', 'G04.140.107.595', 'G09.188.105.595'], ['C17.800.685', 'C23.888.885.625'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.915.715', 'D04.210.500.908.891.927']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
