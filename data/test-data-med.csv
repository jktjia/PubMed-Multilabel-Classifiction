30811,Computational analysis of glycoside hydrolase family 1 specificities.,"Glycoside hydrolase family 1 consists of beta-glucosidases, beta-galactosidases, 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases, myrosinases, and other enzymes having similar primary and tertiary structures but diverse specificities. Among these enzymes, beta-glucosidases hydrolyze cellobiose to glucose, and therefore they are key players in any cellulose to glucose process. All family members attack beta-glycosidic bonds between a pyranosyl glycon and an aglycon, but most have little specificity for the aglycon or for the bond configuration. Furthermore, glycon specificity is not absolute. Sixteen family members (six beta-glucosidases, two cyanogenic beta-glucosidases, one 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase, two myrosinases, and five beta-glycosidases) have known tertiary structures. We have used automated docking to computationally bind disaccharides with allopyranosyl, galactopyranosyl, glucopyranosyl, mannopyranosyl, 6-phosphogalactopyranosyl, and 6-phosphoglucopyranosyl glycons, all linked by beta-(1,2), beta-(1,3), beta-(1,4), and beta-(1,6)-glycosidic bonds to beta-glucopyranoside aglycons, along with beta-(1,1-thio)-allopyranosyl, -galactopyranosyl, -glucopyranosyl, and -mannopyranosyl) beta-glucopyranosides, into all of these structures to investigate the structural determinants of their enzyme specificities. The following are the eight active-site residues: Glu191, Thr194, Phe205, Asn285, Arg336, Asn376, Trp378, and Trp465 (Zea mays beta-glucosidase numbering), that control a significant amount of glycon specificity.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Disaccharides', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Substrate Specificity']",18615662,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.820.235'], ['D09.698.629.305', 'D09.947.750'], ['D08.811.277.450'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['G02.111.835']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
23155,Induction of smoking urge through imaginal and in vivo procedures: physiological and self-report manifestations.,"This experiment assessed reactivity to imaginal and in vivo smoking and control cues. One hundred current smokers were assessed during 2 sessions separated by a 6-hr interval, and half of the participants were abstinent from smoking over this interval. Verbal and physiological reactivity measures were selected based on their relevance for several models of urge. Results indicated that imaginal and in vivo smoking cues were equally effective at eliciting high levels of self-reported urges. Smoking deprivation led to a general enhancement in urge report, rather than a specific increase to smoking cues. Physiological responding differed somewhat as a function of urge induction method, although autonomic responses to smoking cues were uniformly consistent with the direct effects of nicotine. There was no relationship between verbal and physiological urge indices. Implications of the findings for several contemporary models of drug urges are discussed.","['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Cues', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imagery, Psychotherapy', 'Male', 'Motivation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Smoking', 'Social Facilitation', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome']",9103714,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['F02.463.425.234'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.190.525.249', 'F04.754.462'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['F01.145.805'], ['F01.145.813.655'], ['C25.775.835', 'F03.900.825']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
8601,"Owners' view of their pets' emotions, intellect, and mutual relationship: Cats and dogs compared.","Companion animals have established special relationships with humans, as demonstrated by many studies describing their abilities and bonds to communicate with humans. In this questionnaire-based study, we explored owners' views of pets in terms of their emotional and intellectual functions and their relationship with owners, and compared the results between cat owners and dog owners. We found that although both types of owners most often regarded their pets as ""family members,"" this tendency was weaker in cat owners. Cat owners also scored significantly lower than dog owners for some emotions and intellect they thought their pets might have. Additionally, cat owners who regard their cats as family members tend to attribute ""compassion"" to their cats more strongly than cat owners who regard their pets as non-family. This study revealed that some aspects of cat owners' views of their pets differ from those of dog owners. These finding may help us to better understand our heterospecific companions and establish good relationships with them.","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Cats', 'Cognition', 'Dogs', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Human-Animal Bond', 'Humans', 'Intelligence', 'Male', 'Pets', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",28267573,"[['B01.050'], ['F01.145.113'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.377.750.250.125'], ['F02.463.188'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['F01.470'], ['F01.145.496.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.543'], ['B01.050.050.116.600'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
23380,Esophageal cancer as second primary tumor after breast cancer radiotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: An increased risk of esophageal cancer has been reported in survivors of breast cancer treated with radiotherapy. This study further characterizes this association.METHODS: Through hospital databases, 118 patients (109 men, 9 women) treated for esophageal cancer between 1985 and 1993 were identified, of whom 37 had 60 synchronous or metachronous cancers. 5 women had primary esophageal cancer after having breast cancer, and are the subjects of this case-control study.RESULTS: All 5 women had been treated with radical mastectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy; none received chemotherapy. Their ages at the time of breast cancer ranged from 36 to 82 years; at esophageal cancer, 61 to 95 years. Time between radiotherapy and esophageal cancer varied from 13 to 31 years. All esophageal cancers were squamous cell carcinomas. Mean survival after esophageal cancer was 14.2 months.CONCLUSIONS: Radio-induced esophageal cancer can occur as a second primary cancer in women who survive at least 1 decade after mastectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary']",11754854,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['C04.588.180.260', 'C17.800.090.500.260'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['C04.588.274.476.205', 'C04.588.443.353', 'C06.301.371.205', 'C06.405.117.430', 'C06.405.249.205'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.682', 'C26.733.476', 'G01.750.748.500.476'], ['C04.692']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
22359,Effects of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine on rat myometrium.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine on the contractility of isolated uterine muscle strips from pregnant and non-pregnant female rats.METHODS: Full-thick myometrial strips were prepared from 18- to 21-day pregnant (n=8) and non-pregnant rats (n=7). After contractions became regular, strips were exposed to cumulative concentrations of the two drugs from 10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L, amplitude and frequency of the uterine contraction was recorded.RESULTS: Two local anesthetics caused a concentration dependent inhibition on contractility of myometrial strips from pregnant and non-pregnant rats. In the myometrium from non-pregnant rats, -logIC(50) of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine were 4.85 and 4.25 respectively. In the myometrium from pregnant rats, similar concentrations of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine were observed, -logIC(50) were 2.7 and 2.9 respectively. Levobupivacaine produced an increase in amplitude of contractions, while bupivacaine showed an increased trend in frequency.CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that levobupivacaine and bupivacaine may inhibit myometrium contractility. The inhibitory effect of levobupivacaine or bupivacaine is not enhanced by gestation in rat. Levobupivacaine may have more positive influence than bupivacaine in pregnant myometrium.","['Anesthetics, Local', 'Animals', 'Bupivacaine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Levobupivacaine', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Uterine Contraction']",16909479,"[['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.065.199.239', 'D02.092.146.113.239'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.481'], ['D02.065.199.239.500', 'D02.092.146.113.239.500'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['G08.686.784.769.326.700', 'G11.427.494.890']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
31262,Down-regulation and differential restoration of cAMP responses upon transient phorbol ester treatment of primary osteoblastic cells.,"We studied cAMP responses induced by parathyroid hormone (PTH), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and forskolin in foetal rat calvariae-derived osteoblastic cells after 24 h treatment with a protein kinase C (PKC) activating phorbol ester. After this treatment, meant to down-regulate PKC activity, all tested cAMP responses were attenuated and were indeed accompanied by a decline in PKC activity. PTH receptor affinity was not altered and PTH receptor number was only slightly lowered after 24 h phorbol ester treatment. These results indicate that modulation of the cAMP responses by 24 h PMA treatment was mainly caused by a general impairment of adenylyl cyclase activity. Removal of the phorbol ester and subsequent culture for 2 days rendered the cells hyper-responsive to PTH: the PTH-induced cAMP response was 2 to 3 times higher than in control cells. Again no change in binding affinity of the PTH receptor was observed and receptor number was just 10% lower than in control cells. The PGE2- and forskolin-induced cAMP responses were not higher than normal. So, transient phorbol ester treatment leads to a differential, agonist-dependent restoration of the cAMP signalling system.","['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine', 'Adenylyl Cyclases', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Dinoprostone', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Kinetics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Phorbol Esters', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Parathyroid Hormone', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skull', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",8588978,"[['D03.633.100.759.758.824.751.500'], ['D08.811.520.650.200', 'D12.644.360.050', 'D12.776.476.050'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.251'], ['D02.455.849.291.300'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.200'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A11.329.629'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['D02.455.849.291.500.510'], ['D27.505.519.389.735'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.650', 'D12.776.543.750.750.600'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A02.835.232.781'], ['D02.455.849.291.500.510.850']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2833,Distribution of RNA editing sites in Oenothera mitochondrial mRNAs and rRNAs.,"To investigate whether RNA editing in plant mitochondria modifies structural RNAs as well as protein-coding RNAs we compared the genomic-encoded information with the respective transcripts of several genes in Oenothera. The genes analysed are the 5S, 18S and 26 S rRNAs, the alpha-subunit of ATPase (atpA), cytochrome b (cytb), orfB, which is located upstream of cytochrome oxidase subunit III, and the respective leader, trailer and spacer sequences. All open reading frames were found to be edited to some degree. The atpA coding region has the least edited mRNA in Oenothera mitochondria, with only four nucleotides altered in the 1533 nucleotide open reading frame. From this analysis we conclude that frequent RNA editing is indicative of functional protein coding regions in plant mitochondria. The extensive editing in orfB, for example, suggests that this orf codes for a mitochondrial protein. No RNA editing event was found in the 5S rRNA or in the 1824 nucleotides analysed of the 18S rRNA, but two nucleotides were found to be altered in the 1970 nucleotides compared for the 26S rRNA. One nucleotide alteration has changed C to U, the other in reverse U to C. However, only one of five cDNA clones covering this region shows the modifications, similar to many silent editing events in open reading frames. RNA editing in the structural RNAs thus does not seem to be essential for their function in the mitochondrial ribosome.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytochrome b Group', 'DNA', 'Electron Transport Complex IV', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Plants', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Mitochondrial', 'RNA, Ribosomal', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 5S']",1725505,"[['D08.811.277.040.025'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D08.244.187', 'D12.776.422.220.187'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D05.500.562.374', 'D08.811.600.250.687', 'D08.811.682.285', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.875.304', 'D12.776.543.277.687', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.875.484'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.360.335.760.640', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.650'], ['B01.650'], ['D13.444.735'], ['G02.111.760', 'G03.839', 'G05.308.700'], ['D13.444.735.580'], ['D13.444.735.686'], ['D13.444.735.686.675'], ['D13.444.735.686.650']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Sertraline strongly attenuated the rate of dissociation of [3H]nisoxetine from the noradrenaline transporter, while citalopram strongly attenuated that of [3H]citalopram from the 5-HT transporter. The effect of both drugs were stereospecific. Less potent affinity-modulating drugs were identified with regards to [3H]GBR 12935 dissociation from the dopamine transporter.

31376,Spatiotemporal Bayesian inference dipole analysis for MEG neuroimaging data.,"Recently, we described a Bayesian inference approach to the MEG/EEG inverse problem that used numerical techniques to estimate the full posterior probability distributions of likely solutions upon which all inferences were based [Schmidt, D.M., George, J.S., Wood, C.C., 1999. Bayesian inference applied to the electromagnetic inverse problem. Human Brain Mapping 7, 195; Schmidt, D.M., George, J.S., Ranken, D.M., Wood, C.C., 2001. Spatial-temporal bayesian inference for MEG/EEG. In: Nenonen, J., Ilmoniemi, R. J., Katila, T. (Eds.), Biomag 2000: 12th International Conference on Biomagnetism. Espoo, Norway, p. 671]. Schmidt et al. (1999) focused on the analysis of data at a single point in time employing an extended region source model. They subsequently extended their work to a spatiotemporal Bayesian inference analysis of the full spatiotemporal MEG/EEG data set. Here, we formulate spatiotemporal Bayesian inference analysis using a multi-dipole model of neural activity. This approach is faster than the extended region model, does not require use of the subject's anatomical information, does not require prior determination of the number of dipoles, and yields quantitative probabilistic inferences. In addition, we have incorporated the ability to handle much more complex and realistic estimates of the background noise, which may be represented as a sum of Kronecker products of temporal and spatial noise covariance components. This reduces the effects of undermodeling noise. In order to reduce the rigidity of the multi-dipole formulation which commonly causes problems due to multiple local minima, we treat the given covariance of the background as uncertain and marginalize over it in the analysis. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was used to sample the many possible likely solutions.

13575,An alpha modulation index for electroencephalographic studies using complex demodulation.,"An automated technique for measuring the relative amount of amplitude modulation of electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha activity is developed to increase the number of existing tools for differentiating the various types of alpha activity. EEG data collected from 12 normal males is used to characterize alpha modulation frequency characteristics. From these findings, a complex demodulation method is constructed to extract the amplitude modulation envelope of alpha activity from an epoch of EEG data while disregarding both continuous amplitude alpha activity and activity outside the alpha band. A threshold technique is then used to determine the relative amount of modulation contained within the data epoch. This metric is termed the alpha modulation index (AMI). Good correlation (R2 = 0.86) is found when automated scoring results are compared with manual scoring of physiologic EEG alpha modulation. The flexibility of this technique makes it easily adaptable to other EEG frequency bands and applications.","['Electroencephalography', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted']",10912347,"[['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
37203,[Patient information and obtaining informed consent in laparoscopic surgery].,"Since the advent of laparoscopic surgery, the number of suits against surgeons has risen. One of the most frequent complaints is the lack of sufficient information. Physicians in France have a formal obligation to provide information in the contractual legal context established since 1936. This notion has been confirmed in several court cases. The requirement for patient informed consent has been confirmed by several decisions of the Appeals Court and is stated in the code of deontology. The value of classical oral information has been recently questioned in certain court cases. We analyse the current legal situation in France and try to define the content of information required in the case of laparoscopic surgery in addition to the way this information is provided and the means of obtaining informed consent. The information provided must be personalised. The patient must informed that laparoscopy remains a surgical operation. It is licit to warn the patient of predictable risks according to statistical probabilities, of the team's experience and of the patients own status including past history and psychological factors. A written statement may be prepared but must remain a document complementary to personalised oral information. The surgeon must obtain and assure good patient comprehension. The surgical community should publish risk rates in order for surgeons to have reliable references which can be used to define the notion of exceptional risk.","['Cognition', 'Forecasting', 'France', 'Freedom', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Laparoscopy', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Probability', 'Risk Factors', 'Writing']",9773003,"[['F02.463.188'], ['I01.320'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['I01.880.604.473.380', 'N03.706.437.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.880.604.473.650.718', 'I01.880.604.583.427', 'N03.706.437.650.312', 'N03.706.535.489'], ['E01.370.388.250.520', 'E04.502.250.520'], ['I02.233.332.500', 'N02.421.726.407.680'], ['F01.829.401.650.675', 'N05.300.660.625'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['L01.559.423.906']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1
25988,Enhanced glomerular prostaglandin formation in experimental membranous nephropathy.,"To determine whether the induction of immune-mediated glomerular injury influences the formation of cyclooxygenase products by glomerular cells, we determined prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) (as the stable metabolite of TXA2) formation in isolated glomeruli of rats with passive Heymann nephritis (PHN). PHN is a model of membranous nephropathy mediated by antibody and complement independent of inflammatory cells. Five days following induction of PHN by injection of heterologous antibody to rat proximal tubular brush border antigen (Fx1A) rats developed proteinuria 36.5 +/- 34 (controls 3.8 +/- 1 mg/day). Treatment with cobra venom factor, which depleted complement C3 levels to less than 10% of baseline, prevented the development of proteinuria (6.9 +/- 2 mg/day). The development of subepithelial, glomerular immune-complex deposits and proteinuria was associated with a significant stimulation of glomerular PGE2 (87%) and TXB2 (183%) formation. This increment in glomerular prostanoid biosynthesis was significantly inhibited (PGE2 increased 22%, TXB2 increased 75%) in animals that were complement depleted with cobra venom factor. Cobra venom factor had no effect on glomerular prostanoid formation in normal rats. In additional experiments we tested the hypothesis that TXA2 may contribute to mediation of proteinuria in PHN. We utilized a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor UK38485. UK38485 reduced glomerular TXB2 formation by 80% without influencing glomerular deposition of 125I-labeled antibody, and did not alter levels of urine protein excretion in rats with PHN (control 42 +/- 21, UK 38485, 39 +/- 24 mg/day, P greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Animals', 'Complement C3', 'Dinoprostone', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Imidazoles', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Male', 'Prostaglandins', 'Prostaglandins E', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Thromboxane B2']",3474470,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.050.140', 'D12.776.124.486.274.250'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.200'], ['C12.777.419.570.363', 'C13.351.968.419.570.363'], ['D03.383.129.308'], ['A05.810.453.324.359', 'A05.810.453.736.520'], ['D10.251.355.255.550', 'D23.469.050.175.725'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.825.810', 'D10.251.355.310.166.971.810']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27856,Increase in caudate nuclei volumes of first-episode schizophrenic patients taking antipsychotic drugs.,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the pathomorphology of the caudate nuclei in first-episode schizophrenic patients with minimal previous neuroleptic exposure.METHOD: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was used to examine longitudinally the caudate pathomorphology in 29 first-episode schizophrenic patients and 10 healthy comparison subjects. MRI scans were obtained after the subjects entered the study and at 18-month follow-up. The patients were treated with standardized neuroleptic regimens during the 18-month period. Volumetric assessments of the cerebral cortex, lateral ventricles, and caudate nuclei were performed on T1-weighted coronal brain sections. In addition, the patients were systematically evaluated for psychopathology at baseline and during treatment.RESULTS: Caudate volumes increased 5.7% in the patients during the 18-month treatment interval, whereas they decreased 1.6% in the comparison subjects over the same time period. Greater amounts of antipsychotic medication received by patients before the first scan and younger age at the time of the first scan were associated with larger increases in caudate volume.CONCLUSIONS: Caudate enlargement occurs early in the course of treatment in young first-episode schizophrenic patients. This may be a result of an interaction between neuroleptic treatment and the plasticity of dopaminergic neuronal systems in young patients.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Caudate Nucleus', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Cerebral Ventricles', 'Dopamine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology']",7916539,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['D27.505.696.277.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.210.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.700.872.331'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487.550.184'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['A08.186.211.140'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['G11.561.638'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['F03.700.750'], ['F04.824']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

29631,Renal angiomyolipoma: selective arterial embolization--effectiveness and changes in angiomyogenic components in long-term follow-up.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of selective arterial embolization in symptomatic renal angiomyolipoma (AML) and the change in angiomyogenic components during long-term follow-up after embolization.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen adult patients with symptomatic AMLs underwent 16 selective arterial embolizations. The embolic materials used were absolute alcohol with (n = 5) or without (n = 3) iodized oil, Gianturco coils (n = 4), and polyvinyl alcohol foam powder with gelatin sponge (n = 2). Follow-up ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) were performed in six and 14 patients, respectively. The effectiveness of selective arterial embolization was evaluated on the basis of the area of the angiomyogenic components in the AML on initial and follow-up images and clinical improvement.RESULTS: All patients showed devascularization of the tumor on the postembolization angiograms. In 13 patients, clinical symptoms disappeared. The follow-up period was 7-72 months (mean, 33 months). One patient underwent nephrectomy at 7 months after embolization because of a large cystic lesion found at 1 month. In long-term CT follow-up (> or =12 months) in 12 patients, nearly all angiomyogenic components disappeared, but fatty components partially shrank with liquefactive necrosis in tumors.CONCLUSION: Selective arterial embolization is an effective and safe treatment of AML. The angiomyomatous components crucial for the prevention of bleeding were very sensitive to the embolization.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiomyolipoma', 'Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gelatin Sponge, Absorbable', 'Hemostatics', 'Humans', 'Iodized Oil', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyvinyls', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",9205224,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.450.550.125', 'C04.557.450.692.249'], ['E02.520.360', 'E02.926.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['E07.858.740.300'], ['D27.505.954.502.270.463'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D10.627.700.550', 'D20.215.784.750.550'], ['C04.588.945.947.535', 'C12.758.820.750', 'C12.777.419.473', 'C13.351.937.820.535', 'C13.351.968.419.473'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.616', 'D02.455.326.271.884.533', 'D05.750.716.721', 'D25.720.716.721', 'J01.637.051.720.716.721'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

Cytochromes P-450 and P-420 were also present. The cytochrome b5 content of microsomal preparations from a number of oilseed species was found to be in the order of 200-300 pmol/mg of protein. The cytochrome b5 was reduced in the membrane preparations by NADH, demonstrating the presence of an NADH: cytochrome b5 reductase; NADPH was a less effective donor. Microsomal membranes catalysed the NAD(P)H-dependent conversion of radioactive oleate into linoleate, indicating acyl-CoA: lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase and 1-acyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine delta 12-desaturase (delta 12-desaturase) activity. Desaturation of oleate to linoleate was unaffected by CO, but inhibited by CN-. The addition of oleoyl-CoA to the NADH-reduced membranes resulted in the CN(-)-sensitive partial re-oxidation of cytochrome b5, indicating that electrons from NADH were transferred to the site of desaturation via this cytochrome. The delta 12-desaturase in safflower, therefore, is CN(-)-sensitive and appears to require cytochrome b5 and NADH: cytochrome b5 reductase for activity.","['Cytochromes b5', 'Electron Transport', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases', 'Kinetics', 'Microsomes', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plants', 'Spectrophotometry']",2264826,"[['D08.244.187.500', 'D12.776.422.220.187.500'], ['G02.111.248', 'G03.295.531.403', 'G03.493.350'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.392'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A11.284.835.540'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['B01.650'], ['E05.196.712.726', 'E05.196.867.826']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
49663,Cytology and immunocytochemistry of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.,"A study of the value of cytologic examination in the diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma showed that fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is a definitive means of making the diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. In experienced hands, FNA cytology approached a diagnostic accuracy of 100%. With exfoliative cytology, technically adequate sputum samples offered an 82% diagnostic yield; sputum cytology should thus be considered as an adjunct method in establishing the diagnosis. Several cytologic features that strongly suggest the diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and help to differentiate it from adenocarcinomas of other body sites are outlined. It is also concluded that immunocytochemical stains have limited value in differentiating bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and other types of clear cell malignant neoplasms, including mesothelioma, unless a panel of antibodies is used, and are of no value in ascertaining whether the cells are benign or malignant.","['Adenocarcinoma, Bronchiolo-Alveolar', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Body Fluids', 'Bronchi', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Sputum', 'Therapeutic Irrigation']",2827409,"[['C04.557.470.200.025.022.500', 'C04.588.894.797.520.055.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.119', 'E01.370.225.998.054.119', 'E01.370.388.100.100', 'E04.074.119', 'E04.665.100', 'E05.200.500.384.100.119', 'E05.200.998.054.119', 'E05.242.384.100.119'], ['A12.207'], ['A04.411.125'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['A12.200.808'], ['E02.779.492.500', 'E02.831.535.492.500', 'E05.927']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
34938,Motivation deficits and use of alcohol and illicit drugs among individuals with schizophrenia.,"This study examined the impact of substance use on intrinsic motivation and evaluated the association between intrinsic motivation and substance use recovery among individuals with schizophrenia. Alcohol and illicit drug use and intrinsic motivation were evaluated at baseline and 6-months for 1434 individuals with schizophrenia from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) using self-rated substance use assessments and a derived motivation measure from the Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale. Results revealed patients had moderate motivation deficits overall and a considerable number were using alcohol or illicit drugs at baseline (n=576; 40.2%). Regression models at baseline showed patients with low levels of motivation had higher odds of substance use and those who were using substances had greater motivation deficits. At 6-months, substance using patients continued to demonstrate greater motivation deficits; however, those with high levels of motivation exhibited a greater reduction in their use of substances. Findings remained significant after adjusting for clinical confounds and were consistent across any substance, alcohol, and cannabis use. Our results emphasize concerns about substance use compounding motivation deficits in schizophrenia, and suggest that disentangling the motivation-substance use relationship in schizophrenia may facilitate efforts aimed at ameliorating these challenges and improving outcomes.","['Adult', 'Alcohol-Related Disorders', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology', 'Substance-Related Disorders']",28441618,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C25.775.100', 'F03.900.100'], ['F03.615.250.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['F03.700.750'], ['F04.824'], ['C25.775', 'F03.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
40505,Percutaneous treatment of lumbar intervertebral disk hernias with radiopaque gelified ethanol: a preliminary study.,"STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of gelified ethanol in the percutaneous treatment of lumbar disk hernias.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: After the commercial withdrawal of Chymopapain, the need for new substances to treat intervertebral disk hernias was evident. Good results were obtained with pure ethanol, but this substance was difficult to handle. We decided to use a similar substance mixed with ethylcellulose to increase its viscosity and enhanced with radiopaque material.METHODS: Two hundred seventy-six consecutive patients sent to be treated of a lumbar intervertebral disk hernia percutaneously were included in this preliminary study and treated with radiopaque gelified ethanol (RGE) and intra-articular steroids. Three groups were set, group A for patients to be treated only with RGE and groups B and C for difficult cases presenting a narrow canal, foraminal hernia, or hiperalgic sleepless hernia, treated with RGE plus another intradiscal technique, automatized percutaneous diskectomy for group B and radiofrequency nucleoplasty for group C.RESULTS: Very good or good results were obtained in 202 (91.4%) of the 221 patients in group A. Of the 44 patients in group B, 37 patients (84%) presented very good or good results and in 9 (82%) of the 11 patients of group C, we obtained similar results. There was no allergic complication in any of our patients. Short-term follow-up with magnetic resonance showed little or no changes in the intervertebral disk but there was discordance with clinical signs. Long-term follow-up magnetic resonance showed a dramatic reduction in hernia volume.CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows the efficacy and inocuity of this new substance that could take over the Chymopapain therapeutic field.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cellulose', 'Contrast Media', 'Diskectomy, Percutaneous', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Intervertebral Disc Chemolysis', 'Intervertebral Disc Displacement', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sclerosing Solutions', 'Treatment Outcome']",17912130,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D05.750.078.562.180', 'D09.698.365.180', 'D25.720.099.500', 'J01.637.051.720.099.500'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['E02.718.444.200', 'E04.188.350.200', 'E04.555.200.200'], ['D02.033.375'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.718.500'], ['C05.116.900.307', 'C23.300.707.952'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D26.776.708.822', 'D27.505.954.411.700', 'D27.505.954.578.822', 'D27.720.752.822'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

22928,Effect of fluvoxamine augmentation and smoking on clozapine serum concentrations.,"BACKGROUND: Clozapine (CLZ) is metabolized via cytochrome P450 CYP1A2 to N-desmethylclozapine (NCLZ). Smoking induces CYP1A2 thereby increasing clozapine metabolism whereas fluvoxamine inhibits CYP1A2. Studies suggest that the beneficial effect of fluvoxamine augmentation in raising serum clozapine concentrations also occurs when serum concentrations are low due to smoking. Yet, little is known about the influence of fluvoxamine augmentation on clozapine serum concentrations in smoking versus non-smoking patients.METHODS: A TDM database was analyzed. Serum concentrations of CLZ, NCLZ, dose-adjusted serum concentrations (C/D) and metabolite-to-parent ratios (MPR) were compared using non-parametrical tests in four groups: clozapine-monotherapy in non-smokers (VNS, n = 28) and smokers (VS, n = 43); combined treatment with clozapine and fluvoxamine in non-smokers (VNS+F, n = 11) and smokers (VS+F, n = 43).RESULTS: The CLZ monotherapy smoking group showed lower values of C/D CLZ of -38.6% (p < 0.001), C/D NCLZ -35.6% (p < 0.001) and a higher MPR (p = 0.021) than in the non-smoking group. The combination of CLZ and fluvoxamine in non-smoking patients led to higher C/D values: C/D CLZ +117.9% (p < 0.001), C/D NCLZ +60.8% (p = 0.029) while the MPR did not differ between groups (p = 0.089). Changes were comparable to fluvoxamine augmentation in the smoking group with increased C/D CLZ of +120.1% (p < 0.001), C/D NCLZ of +85.8% (p < 0.001) and lower MPR (p = 0.006).CONCLUSIONS: Smoking in clozapine monotherapy reduced median dose-adjusted serum concentrations more than a third. Combined treatment with fluvoxamine and clozapine led to higher median C/D values in both, smokers and non-smokers. The opposing effects of CYP1A2 induction by smoking and inhibition by fluvoxamine on clozapine serum concentrations balanced out.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Cigarette Smoking', 'Clozapine', 'Comorbidity', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fluvoxamine', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Schizophrenia', 'Young Adult']",31182321,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.696.277.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.210.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.700.872.331'], ['F01.145.805.375.750', 'F01.145.958.875.750'], ['D03.633.300.240.220'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['D27.505.389.500.120', 'D27.505.519.389.335.120'], ['G07.690.773.968.477'], ['E02.319.310'], ['D02.092.570.665.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F03.700.750'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

49601,Antimicrobial activity of human á-defensin 5 and its linear analogs: N-terminal fatty acylation results in enhanced antimicrobial activity of the linear analogs.,"Human á-defensin 5 (HD5) exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and plays an important role in mucosal immunity of the small intestine. Although there have been several studies, the structural requirements for activity and mechanism of bacterial killing is yet to be established unequivocally. In this study, we have investigated the antimicrobial activity of HD5 and linear analogs. Cysteine deletions attenuated the antibacterial activity considerably. Candidacidal activity was affected to a lesser extent. Fatty acid conjugated linear analogs showed antimicrobial activity comparable activity to HD5. Effective surface charge neutralization of bacteria was observed for HD5 as compared to the non-fatty acylated linear analogs. Our results show that HD5 and non-fatty acylated linear analogs enter the bacterial cytoplasm without causing damage to the bacterial inner membrane. Although fatty acylated peptides exhibited antimicrobial activity comparable to HD5, their mechanism of action involved permeabilization of the Escherichia coli inner membrane. HD5 and analogs had the ability to bind plasmid DNA. HD5 had greater binding affinity to plasmid DNA as compared to the analogs. The three dimensional structure of HD5 favors greater interaction with the bacterial cell surface and also with DNA. Antibacterial activity of HD5 involves entry into bacterial cytoplasm and binding to DNA which would result in shut down of the bacterial metabolism leading to cell death. We show how a moderately active linear peptide derived from the á-defensin HD5 can be engineered to enhance antimicrobial activity almost comparable to the native peptide.","['Acylation', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Escherichia coli', 'Humans', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'alpha-Defensins']",26206286,"[['G02.111.012', 'G02.607.063', 'G03.040'], ['D27.505.954.122'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.600'], ['D12.644.050.200.050', 'D12.776.543.695.054.200.050']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9821,Interoceptive accuracy predicts nonplanning trait impulsivity.,"Influential theories concerning personality argue that many impulsive individuals show physiological underarousal at rest. This interoceptive state is proposed to be egodystonic, motivating impulsive maladaptive actions to enhance arousal. However, there is little empirical research on this matter. The current study tested the relationship between physiological markers of arousal, measures of interoceptive (in)sensitivity, and trait impulsivity in a nonclinical sample of young adults. Experiment 1 investigated whether individuals (N = 31) with high trait impulsivity show decreased resting measures of arousal (indexed from heart rate, heart rate variability, and sympathetic electrodermal activity). Experiment 2 assessed whether trait impulsivity is linked to interoceptive abilities (N = 60). Overall, our results do not provide any compelling support for the underarousal theory of impulsivity. However, impaired interoceptive (cardiac discrimination) accuracy predicted the degree of Barratt nonplanning impulsivity, such that individuals with a better ability to distinguish between internal (bodily) and external signals manifest lower levels of nonplanning trait impulsivity. These findings open an avenue for potential novel interventions aimed at improving planning abilities via better interoceptive discrimination.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arousal', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Interoception', 'Male', 'Personality', 'Young Adult']",30702155,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F02.830.104', 'G11.561.035'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E05.796.332', 'F02.830.702.315', 'F04.669.332', 'G07.265.563', 'G13.750.415'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.527'], ['F02.463.593.465'], ['F01.752'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

32624,Cloning and characterization of a galactitol 2-dehydrogenase from Rhizobium legumenosarum and its application in D-tagatose production.,"Galactitol 2-dehydrogenase (GDH) belongs to the protein subfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases and can be used to produce optically pure building blocks and for the bioconversion of bioactive compounds. An NAD(+)-dependent GDH from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841 (RlGDH) was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The RlGDH protein was purified as an active soluble form using His-tag affinity chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 28kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 114kDa by gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that the enzyme is a homotetramer. The enzyme has an optimal pH and temperature of 9.5 and 35°C, respectively. The purified recombinant RlGDH catalyzed the oxidation of a wide range of substrates, including polyvalent aliphatic alcohols and polyols, to the corresponding ketones and ketoses. Among various polyols, galactitol was the preferred substrate of RlGDH with a Km of 8.8mM, kcat of 835min(-1) and a kcat/Km of 94.9min(-1)mM(-1). Although GDHs have been characterized from a few other sources, RlGDH is distinguished from other GDHs by its higher specific activity for galactitol and broad substrate spectrum, making RlGDH a good choice for practical applications.","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Escherichia coli', 'Galactitol', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Rhizobium leguminosarum', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases']",24731824,"[['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500', 'G02.111.570.820.709.600.500'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D12.776.097'], ['G02.130'], ['E05.196.181.400.170'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['E05.393.220'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D02.033.800.400', 'D09.853.400'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.364.249', 'G05.360.340.358.024.249', 'G05.360.340.358.207.249'], ['G02.300'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.494'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['B03.440.400.425.700.800.450', 'B03.585.900.450', 'B03.660.050.662.670.450'], ['E05.393.751'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200'], ['G02.111.835'], ['D08.811.682.047.150.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
44251,PKD controls ávâ3 integrin recycling and tumor cell invasive migration through its substrate Rabaptin-5.,"Integrin recycling is critical for cell migration. Protein kinase D (PKD) mediates signals from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) to control ávâ3 integrin recycling. We now show that Rabaptin-5, a Rab5 effector in endosomal membrane fusion, is a PKD substrate. PKD phosphorylates Rabaptin-5 at Ser407, and this is both necessary and sufficient for PDGF-dependent short-loop recycling of ávâ3, which in turn inhibits á5â1 integrin recycling. Rab4, but not Rab5, interacts with phosphorylated Rabaptin-5 toward the front of migrating cells to promote delivery of ávâ3 to the leading edge, thereby driving persistent cell motility and invasion that is dependent on this integrin. Consistently, disruption of Rabaptin-5 Ser407 phosphorylation reduces persistent cell migration in 2D and ávâ3-dependent invasion. Conversely, invasive migration that is dependent on á5â1 integrin is promoted by disrupting Rabaptin phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that the PKD pathway couples receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to an integrin switch via Rabaptin-5 phosphorylation.","['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaVbeta3', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins']",22975325,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['A11.251'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.395.550.625.439', 'D12.776.543.550.625.439', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.460.870.500', 'D12.776.543.750.705.675.541'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A11.251.210.100.550', 'A11.329.228.100.550'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['D12.776.543.990']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1548,Insulin-like growth factor 2 and short-range stimulatory loops in control of human placental growth.,"Substructures of the first-trimester human placenta (within 3 months post-conception) display 'pseudo-malignant' properties. We show here, by in situ hybridization, that the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) gene expression is particularly active in the cytotrophoblasts, which dominate these structures. Because the majority of placental IGF-2 mRNA is polysomal in extracts of first-trimester placenta, the spatial pattern of IGF-2 transcripts generally also defines the pattern of IGF-2 production. In primary trophoblast cultures, rendered quiescent by serum starvation. IGF-2 performs as a human embryonic growth factor by activating cell cycle entry/progression. Although both type 1 and 2 IGF receptor mRNAs can be found co-distributed with IGF-2 mRNA during placental development (supporting an autocrine role for IGF-2), these occasional patterns are confined to cytotrophoblasts with low proliferative potential. The reciprocity in ligand and receptor expression patterns are discussed in terms of rate-limiting steps in the involvement of IGF-2 in the proliferative phenotype of the early human placenta.","['Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Placenta', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Somatomedin', 'Somatomedins', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2551671,"[['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251'], ['G05.308'], ['G05.360.340.024.340'], ['G07.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.937.420', 'D12.776.124.862.425', 'D12.776.467.937.420', 'D23.529.937.420'], ['E05.393.661', 'G02.111.611'], ['A16.710'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.750.400.780'], ['D12.644.276.937', 'D12.776.124.862', 'D12.776.467.937', 'D23.529.937'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The maximum relaxation response to ACh, an endothelium-dependent vasodilation, was lower in aortas from old rats. Sensitivity (mean effective concentration; EC50) of ACh in old rats was significantly less than in young rats. There were no differences in maximum NOC-18-induced relaxation, an endothelium-independent vasodilation, in aortas from young and old rats. On the other hand, the concentration-response curve for NOC-18 was shifted to the right and the sensitivity (EC50 to NOC-18) was lower in old rats.

Analysis of this model without assuming any parametric distribution for the model error is challenging, and the model complexity is enhanced in the presence of large number of covariates. We developed a nonparametric Bayesian method for regularized estimation of the regression parameters in a flexible accelerated failure time model. The novelties of our method lie in modeling the error distribution of the accelerated failure time nonparametrically, modeling the variance as a function of the mean, and adopting a variable selection technique in modeling the mean. The proposed method allowed for identifying a set of important regression parameters, estimating survival probabilities, and constructing credible intervals of the survival probabilities. We evaluated operating characteristics of the proposed method via simulation studies. Finally, we apply our new comprehensive method to analyze the motivating breast cancer data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, and estimate the five-year survival probabilities for women included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1990 and 2000.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prognosis', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",28034170,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['E05.318.740.600.200', 'N05.715.360.750.625.150', 'N06.850.520.830.600.200'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['E05.318.740.525', 'L01.906.394.422', 'N05.715.360.750.540', 'N06.850.520.830.525'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.308.970.725', 'N04.452.859.819.725', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700.725', 'N06.850.520.308.970.725'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Two workload strategies were followed: strategy 1--increments in speed at a constant slope and strategy 2--increments in slope at constant velocity. Thus, data on cardio-respiratory and propulsion technique parameters were obtained on two identical series of 16 speed and slope combinations. Between each two identical speed and slope combinations of strategies 1 and 2, a different workload history is apparent. A four-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures on the factors ""strategy"" (workload history), ""speed,"" and ""slope"" was applied (P less than 0.05). No ""strategy"" effect was seen in the cardio-respiratory parameters (gross mechanical efficiency, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and heart rate), work/cycle, and cycle time. Thus, within the experimental set-up, workload history did not affect the parameters studied and 3-min workload periods appeared sufficiently long for experienced wheelchair users to adapt to the requirements of a given speed and slope combination. Significant effects were found on ""speed,"" ""slope,"" and their interaction in all parameters tested. Moreover, a comparison of two equal levels of power output, but different speed and slope, led to a significantly higher efficiency, cycle time, and work per cycle for the ""low speed and high slope"" combination. Push time and recovery time appeared highly dependent on speed and slope, respectively. The findings indicate that propulsion technique and cardio-respiratory parameters should not merely be studied in relation to power output, but also with respect to its constituents, speed, and slope/resistance.","['Adult', 'Disabled Persons', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Exercise Test', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Physical Exertion', 'Respiration', 'Sports', 'Wheelchairs']",2963939,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.150'], ['G03.295'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G11.427.683'], ['G09.772.705'], ['I03.450.642.845'], ['E07.796.980']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
27566,Rationale and design of the DP-TRANSFERS project: diabetes prevention-transferring findings from European research to society in Catalonia.,"BACKGROUND: Compelling evidence has been accumulated to support the effectiveness of intensive lifestyle intervention in delaying progression to Type 2 diabetes even in people identified as being at high risk determined by the Finnish diabetes risk score. The DE-PLAN-CAT project (diabetes in Europe-prevention using lifestyle, physical activity and nutritional intervention-Catalonia) evidenced that intensive lifestyle intervention was feasible and cost-effective on a short scale in real-life primary care settings, at least over 4 years. However, transferring such lifestyle interventions to society remains the major challenge of research in the field of diabetes prevention.METHODS/DESIGN: The derived DP-TRANSFERS (diabetes prevention-transferring findings from European research to society) is a large scale national programme aimed at translating a tailored lifestyle intervention to the maximum of primary care centres where feasible through a core proposal agreed with all the partners. The method is built upon a 3-step (screening, intervention and follow-up) real-life, community-wide structure on the basis of a dual intensity lifestyle intervention (basic and continuity modules) and supported by a 4-channel transfer strategy (institutional relationships, facilitators' workshops, collaborative groupware and programme WEB page). Participation will initially cover nine health departments (7 million inhabitants) through nine coordinating centres located in metropolitan (3.2 million), semi-urban (2.9 million) and rural (0.9 million) areas from which it is expected accessing 25 % of all primary care settings, equivalent to 90 associated centres (1.6-1.8 million people) with an estimate of 0.32 million participants aged 45-75 years at high risk of future development of diabetes. To ascertain sustainability, effect, satisfaction and quality of the translation programme statistical analyses will be performed from both the entire population (facilitators and participants) and a stratified representative sample obtained by collecting data from at least 920 participants.DISCUSSION: The DP-TRANSFERS will use a strategy of approach to society consistent with the impact of the disease and the fast accessibility provided by primary care settings in Catalonia. Both the widespread effect of the lifestyle intervention and the translational process itself could be assessed.","['Aged', 'Biomedical Research', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Europe', 'Geography', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Research Design', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Translational Medical Research']",27118544,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['H01.770.644.145'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['Z01.542'], ['H01.277.500'], ['I02.233.332.445', 'N02.421.726.407.579'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.458'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['E05.581.500', 'H01.770.644.728'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['H01.770.644.145.675']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

Conditioned medium (CM) from hMSC spheroids inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages from secreting proinflammatory cytokines TNFá, CXCL2, IL6, IL12p40, and IL23. CM also increased the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL10 and IL1ra by the stimulated macrophages, and augmented expression of CD206, a marker of alternatively activated M2 macrophages. The principal anti-inflammatory activity in CM had a small molecular weight, and microarray data suggested that it was prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This was confirmed by the observations that PGE2 levels were markedly elevated in hMSC spheroid-CM, and that the anti-inflammatory activity was abolished by an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a silencing RNA for COX-2, and an antibody to PGE2. The anti-inflammatory effects of the PGE2 on stimulated macrophages were mediated by the EP4 receptor. Spheroids formed by human adult dermal fibroblasts produced low levels of PGE2 and displayed negligible anti-inflammatory effects on stimulated macrophages, suggesting the features as unique to hMSCs. Moreover, production of PGE2 by hMSC spheroids was dependent on the activity of caspases and NFêB activation in the hMSCs. The results indicated that hMSCs in 3D-spheroid cultures are self-activated, in part by intracellular stress responses, to produce PGE2 that can change stimulated macrophages from a primarily proinflammatory M1 phenotype to a more anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype.","['Antibodies', 'Caspases', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cytokines', 'Dinoprostone', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'NF-kappa B', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP4 Subtype', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spheroids, Cellular']",22865689,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126', 'D12.644.360.075.405', 'D12.776.476.075.405'], ['E01.370.225.500.223', 'E05.200.500.265', 'E05.242.223', 'E05.481.500.249'], ['D27.720.470.305.250', 'E07.206.250'], ['D08.811.600.720.750'], ['D27.505.519.389.310.500', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500.500.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030.500.500', 'D27.505.954.329.030.500.500'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.200'], ['A11.329.228'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.503.280'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['G12.287.500'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['D12.776.503.311'], ['A11.329.830.500', 'A11.872.590.500'], ['D05.500.672', 'D12.776.260.600', 'D12.776.660.600', 'D12.776.930.600'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.200.700.600.400'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A11.251.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
19675,The kinase inhibitor O6-cyclohexylmethylguanine (NU2058) potentiates the cytotoxicity of cisplatin by mechanisms that are independent of its effect upon CDK2.,"O(6)-Cyclohexylmethylguanine (NU2058) was developed as an inhibitor of CDK2 and was previously shown to potentiate cisplatin cytotoxicity in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of cisplatin potentiation by NU2058. SQ20b, head and neck cancer cells were treated for 2h with NU2058 (100 microM) and then for a further 2h with cisplatin and NU2058. NU2058 increased cisplatin cytotoxicity, by clonogenic assay, with a dose modification factor (DMF) of 3.1. NU2058 increased total intracellular platinum levels 1.5-fold, and platinum-DNA adduct levels twofold. Furthermore, the cisplatin-DNA adducts formed were more toxic in the presence of NU2058. To investigate whether the effects of NU2058 on cisplatin adduct levels and toxicity were dependent on CDK2 activity, additional CDK2 inhibitors were tested. NU6230 (CDK2 IC(50) 18 microM) was equipotent to NU2058 (CDK2 IC(50) 17 microM) as a CDK2 inhibitor in cell-free and cell-based assays, yet did not potentiate cisplatin cytotoxicity. Furthermore, NU6102 was >1000-fold more potent than NU2058 as a CDK2 inhibitor (CDK2 IC(50) 5 nM) yet was no more active than NU2058 in potentiating cisplatin. NU2058 also potentiated melphalan (DMF 2.3), and monohydroxymelphalan (1.7), but not temozolomide or ionising radiation. Whilst NU2058 increased melphalan cytotoxicity, it did not increase melphalan-DNA adduct formation. These studies demonstrate that NU2058 alters the transport of cisplatin, causing more Pt-DNA adducts, as well as sensitizing cells to cisplatin- and melphalan-induced DNA damage. However, the effects of NU2058 are independent of CDK2 inhibition.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cisplatin', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'DNA Adducts', 'Drug Synergism', 'Guanine', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",19426695,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.346'], ['D01.210.375', 'D01.625.125', 'D01.710.100'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.500.750', 'D12.644.360.250.323', 'D12.776.167.200.323', 'D12.776.476.250.323'], ['D13.444.308.135', 'G05.200.104'], ['G07.690.773.968.477'], ['D03.633.100.759.758.399.454'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.519.389.755'], ['E01.370.225.500.383.910', 'E01.370.225.500.388.930', 'E05.200.500.383.910', 'E05.200.500.388.930', 'E05.242.383.910', 'E05.242.417.500', 'E05.337.550.200.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

163,One-step synthesis of methylene-bridged bis-carbazole and evaluation of its antitumor activity and G-quadruplex DNA binding property.,"Most reported carbazolyl G-quadruplex DNA (G4-DNA) ligands possess a rigid structure rather than a flexible one. The conformationally flexible ligands are paid much less attention. In this study, we report a novel class of non-rigid methylene-bridged biscarbazolyl ligand and their G4-DNA binding properties. Moreover, the antitumor activities of all these oligomers have been evaluated. The results show that this family of oligomers could be facilely synthesized via solely one step. Among them, compound 2, the bis-carbazole derivative, displays the best antitumor activity and IC50 values against HT-29, HepG2, A375 and MCF-7 cells are 0.69, 5.09, 3.15 and 3.8 ì mol/L, respectively. Although conformationally flexible, 2 is still capable of binding to as well as stabilizing G4-DNA via ð-ð stacking interaction. Moreover, 2 selectively binds to G4-DNA over duplex DNA. The current study enriches the category of carbazolyl G4-DNA ligands and paves the way for the search of more efficient G4-DNA ligands and antitumor leads.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Carbazoles', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA', 'G-Quadruplexes', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasms', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",31255989,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D03.633.100.473.144', 'D03.633.300.148'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G02.111.570.820.486.550', 'G05.360.580.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['C04'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41609,"The burden of mental ill health associated with childhood maltreatment in the UK, using The Health Improvement Network database: a population-based retrospective cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Childhood maltreatment is a global public health, human rights, and moral issue that is associated with a substantial mental health burden. We aimed to assess the association between childhood maltreatment and the development of mental ill health and the initiation of new prescriptions for mental ill health.METHODS: In this population-based, retrospective, open cohort study, we used a dataset from individuals in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. THIN database comprises UK electronic medical records taken from 787 general practices throughout the UK. We used read codes in these records to identify exposed patients (those with a read code identifying officially confirmed childhood maltreatment or a maltreatment-related concern) and up to two unexposed patients (those without such read codes) from the same general practice, who were matched by age and sex. We evaluated the risk of developing depression, anxiety, or serious mental illness (a composite mental ill health outcome) or initiation of a prescription drug used to treat mental ill health, and the odds ratio of these events at baseline, in the exposed versus unexposed patients.FINDINGS: The first possible date for cohort entry (the study start date) was Jan 1, 1995, and patients could enter the cohort until the study end date, Dec 31, 2018. During the study period, 11 831 850 patients were eligible to participate. Of these patients, we identified 217 758 (1·8%) patients with any recorded childhood maltreatment. These patients were matched to 423 410 unexposed control patients with no recorded exposure to childhood maltreatment. The exposed group were followed up for a median of 1·8 years (IQR 0·6-4·3) versus 3·2 years (1·3-6·1) in the unexposed group. During the study period, 11 665 (5·9%) new diagnoses of mental ill health were made in the exposed group, giving an incidence rate of 16·8 events per 1000 person-years versus 15 301 (3·7%) new recorded diagnoses at an incidence rate of 8·3 events per 1000 person-years in the unexposed cohort, giving an adjusted IRR of 2·14 (95% CI 2·08-2·19). 30 911 (14·8%) patients in the exposed group received a new prescription for any type of mental ill health (incidence rate 46·5 events per 1000 person-years) versus 36 390 (8·9%) patients in the unexposed group (20·5 per 1000 person-years) resulting in an adjusted IRR of 2·44 (95% CI 2·40-2·48).INTERPRETATION: Childhood maltreatment is thought to affect one in three children globally; therefore, a doubled risk of developing mental ill health among these individuals represents a substantial contribution to the mental ill health burden in the UK. It is imperative that public health approaches, including those aimed at preventing and detecting childhood maltreatment and its associated negative consequences, are implemented to prevent mental ill health.FUNDING: None.","['Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost of Illness', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United Kingdom']",31564467,"[['M01.060.406'], ['I01.198.240.856.350.250', 'I01.880.735.900.350.250'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['N03.219.151.165', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.182', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.046'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400', 'L01.470.750.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F03'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1

The venom antigenicity, procoagulant activities and neutralization using Thai C. rhodostoma Monovalent Antivenom (CRMAV) were also investigated. SDS-PAGE patterns of the venoms were relatively similar with minor variations. Proteomic analysis revealed that snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs, particularly P-I class), serine proteases (SVSPs) and snaclecs dominated the venom protein composition (68.96-81.80%), followed by L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (7.37-11.08% and 5.18-13.81%, respectively), corroborating C. rhodostoma envenoming effects (hemorrhage, consumptive coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and local tissue necrosis). Other proteins of lower abundances (2.82-9.13%) identified include cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP), phospholipase B, phosphodiesterase, nerve growth factor, 5'-nucleotidase, aminopeptidase and hyaluronidase. All four venoms exhibited strong procoagulant effects which were neutralized by CRMAV to different extents. CRMAV immunoreactivity was high toward venoms of CR-M, CR-I and CR-T but relatively low for CR-V venom. Among the venom samples from different locales, CR-V venom proteome has the smallest SVMP composition while SVSP, PLA2 and phosphodiesterase were more abundant in the venom. These variations in C. rhodostoma venom protein composition could partly explain the differences seen in immunoreactivity.

189,"[Prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in a group of pre-school and school children, living in conditions of poverty].","Iron deficiency is common during the first years of life. Yet, there is a paucity of data on scholar children. Our main objective was to estimate the prevalence of ferropenic anemia in children 3 to 12 years of age living under conditions of poverty. A total of 323 children were included, 171 attended to a day care institution (group A) and 152 were from the same community but not attended in the day care institution (group B). Hemoglobin (Hb), medium corpuscular volume (MCV) and serum ferritin (SF) were measured in all children. In those with Hb < or = 11 g/dl and/or MCV < or = 73 fl and/or SF < or = 15 microg/l, transferrin saturation (TS) and soluble transferrin receptors (sTR) were also measured. Iron deficiency was defined as SF < or = 15 mg/l and ferropenic anemia was defined as Hb < or = 11 g/dl or MCV < or = 73 fl with sTR > or = 38 mmol/l and SF < or = 10 microg/l or TS < or = 10%. There were no differences between the groups regarding age, weight, height, education, gender and housing conditions. Mean hemoglobin level was 12.6 g/dl (group A: 12.4 g/dl vs. group B: 12.7 g/dl; p=0.012), and mean SF was 45 mg/l, without significant differences between groups. Prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was 2.5% (8/323) and iron deficiency was 4.4% (14/317), without significant differences between groups. These results persisted after controlling for confounding variables. In this group of children living under conditions of poverty in Argentina, iron deficiency anemia was uncommon.

23736,Oxidative treatment characteristics of biotreated textile-dyeing wastewater and chemical agents used in a textile-dyeing process by advanced oxidation process.,"The oxidative treatment characteristics of biotreated textile-dyeing wastewater and typical chemicals such as desizing, scouring, dispersing and swelling agents used in the textile-dyeing process by advanced oxidation process were experimentally studied. The refractory organic matters remained in the effluent of biological treatment process without degradation may be suitable for the improvement of biodegradability and mineralized to CO2 by combined ozonation with and without hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, the refractory chemicals contained in the scouring agent A and swelling agent may not be mineralized and their biodegradability may not be improved by ozonation. However, the BOD/DOC ratio of scouring agent B increased from 0.3 to 0.45 after ozonation. Based on the results described above, advanced treatment process involving the ozonation without and with the addition of hydrogen peroxide, followed by biological treatment was proposed for the treatment of refractory wastewater discharged from the textile-dyeing process.","['Bioreactors', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Coloring Agents', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Oxidants', 'Oxidants, Photochemical', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Ozone', 'Textile Industry', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Water Purification']",15137417,"[['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['D27.720.233'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.424', 'D01.339.431.374.424', 'D01.650.550.750.400', 'D02.389.338.253'], ['D02'], ['D27.720.642', 'D27.888.569.540'], ['D27.720.642.631', 'D27.888.569.540.631'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D01.362.670.600'], ['J01.576.655.937'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.900.900', 'N06.850.860.510.900.900']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
17207,Design of Gaussia luciferase-based bioluminescent stem-loop probe for sensitive detection of HIV-1 nucleic acids.,"Here we describe the design of a bioluminescent stem-loop probe for the sensitive detection of HIV-1 spliced RNA. In this study, we employed Gaussia luciferase (GLuc), a bioluminescent protein that has several advantages over other bioluminescent proteins, including smaller size, higher bioluminescent intensity, and chemical and thermal stability. GLuc was chemically conjugated to the DABCYL-modified stem-loop probe (SLP) and was purified with a 2-step process to remove unconjugated GLuc and SLP. The binding of the target RNA to the loop region of the SLP results in the open conformation separating the stem part of SLP. GLuc conjugated to the stem acts as a reporter that produces light by a chemical reaction upon adding its substrate, coelenterazine in the presence of the target, while DABCYL serves as a quencher of bioluminescence in the closed conformation of SLP in the absence of the target. The optimized GLuc based-SLP assay resulted in a signal-to-background ratio of 47, which is the highest reported with bioluminescent SLPs and is significantly higher compared to traditional fluorescence-based SLPs that yield low signal to background ratio. Moreover, the assay showed an excellent selectivity against a single and double mismatched nucleic acid target, low detection limit, and ability to detect spiked HIV-1 RNA in human serum matrix.","['Animals', 'Copepoda', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Luciferases', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'RNA, Viral']",29897056,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.131.365.160'], ['B04.820.650.589.650.350.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.682.517', 'D12.776.532.510'], ['D12.776.532'], ['D13.444.735.828']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

11345,"Hematologic, biochemical, hormonal, and redox status alterations during reproductive activity in adult rams of two breeds.","BACKGROUND: Reproduction is a crucial, energy-consuming physiologic activity, which can temporarily disturb the homeostatic balance of the organism. Although rams are commonly placed in intense breeding programs on contemporary sheep farms, the clinicopathologic and redox status alterations have not been adequately studied during reproductive activity.OBJECTIVES: The objective was to investigate the clinicopathologic and redox status changes in rams during reproductive activity.METHODS: Thirty-seven (19 Chios and 18 Florina breed) adult, healthy rams were individually mated with ten estrus-synchronized ewes of the same breed. Blood samples were collected prior to mating, during mating, and postmating. CBC (Advia 120), cytologic blood smear evaluation, biochemical analyses (Flexor E, AVL 9180 Electrolyte Analyzer), and thyroxine measurements (Immulite 1000) were performed. The reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) test, the biological antioxidant potential (BAP) test, and oxidative stress index were used to assess redox status. The linear mixed effects model (statistical language R) was used for statistical analyses.RESULTS: Many, mostly breed-independent, clinicopathologic changes were detected during reproductive activity. Conversely, redox status alterations were found to be breed-dependent.CONCLUSIONS: Intense reproductive activity was related to mild, acute muscle damage in both breeds and mild oxidative stress in Florina rams, whereas Chios rams exhibited oxidative stress resistance. The observed clinicopathologic and redox status alterations were generally consistent with those reported during various forms of physical activity and exercise in animals and humans. Intense reproductive activity does not seem to be physiologically innocuous; however, it appears to be a relatively mild muscle-damaging physical activity.","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Breeding', 'Male', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reproduction', 'Sheep', 'Species Specificity', 'Thyroxine']",31062434,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107', 'E01.370.225.625.107', 'E05.200.500.195.107', 'E05.200.625.107', 'E05.242.195.107', 'G04.140.107', 'G09.188.105'], ['E05.820.150', 'G05.090'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['G08.686.784'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['G16.824'], ['D06.472.931.812', 'D12.125.072.050.767']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

41168,Ly49Q defines 2 pDC subsets in mice.,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play an important primary role for antiviral innate immunity by rapidly producing large amounts of type 1 interferon (IFN) upon viral infection. To study pDC biology, we generated a monoclonal antibody, termed 2E6, that recognizes pDCs. Molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding the 2E6 antigen revealed that it is a type II C-type lectin, Ly49Q, that consists of 247 amino acids with high homology to the natural killer (NK) receptor family Ly49, with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in the cytoplasmic domain. Ly49Q is expressed on pDCs but not on NK cells or myeloid dendritic cells. B220+, CD11c+, CD11b- pDCs in bone marrow were divided into Ly49Q+ and Ly49Q- subsets. While both subsets produced IFN-alpha upon cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) and herpes simplex virus stimulation, Ly49Q- pDCs responded poorly to influenza virus. In addition, Ly49Q- pDCs produced inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) upon stimulation at lower levels than those produced by Ly49Q+ pDCs. In contrast to bone marrow, Ly49Q+ pDCs were only found in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and spleen. These results indicate that Ly49Q is a specific marker for peripheral pDCs and that expression of Ly49Q defines 2 subsets of pDCs in bone marrow.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Ly', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD11b Antigen', 'CD11c Antigen', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Female', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, NK Cell Lectin-Like', 'Spleen']",15598811,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['G12.100'], ['D23.050.301.264.920', 'D23.101.100.920'], ['D23.101'], ['A11.148', 'A15.378.316'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.074.750', 'D12.776.543.550.200.093.750', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.100.150', 'D12.776.543.750.705.833.062', 'D23.050.301.350.074.049'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.074.875', 'D12.776.395.550.200.275.500', 'D12.776.543.550.200.093.875', 'D12.776.543.550.200.275.500', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.100.200', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.600.100.500', 'D12.776.543.750.705.833.249.500', 'D23.050.301.350.074.074', 'D23.050.301.350.275.500'], ['A11.251'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['A11.066.270', 'A11.436.270', 'A15.382.066.270', 'A15.382.670.260'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.250', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.250', 'D23.529.374.440.890.250'], ['D12.776.503.280'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.775.400.100.500', 'D12.644.360.587.100.500', 'D12.776.476.592.100.500', 'D12.776.543.733.937.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.895.800.100', 'D23.050.301.264.920.500', 'D23.101.100.920.500'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.775.300.100', 'D12.644.360.585.100', 'D12.776.476.564.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.895.800'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
24530,Evaluation on treatment of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis against patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome following wasp stings.,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the treatment of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (SLED) against patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) following wasp stings.METHODS: Clinical data of 35 patients with MODS following wasp stings were retrospectively analysed. These patients were divided into three groups according to the treatment strategy used: 1) hemodialysis (HD) group, 2) continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH)/HD group, and 3) SLED/HD group. The clinical parameters, treatment outcome, and safety findings were compared among the three groups.RESULTS: The recovery rate (76.92% vs 77.78% vs 91.67%, p = 0.621) and mortality rate (15.38% vs 11.11% vs 8.33%, p = 0.999) were similar among the three groups. When compared to the HD group, patients treated with CVVH/HD or SLED/HD required a shorter period of time to enter into polyuria stage [(24.7 ± 4.3) days vs (20.2 ± 4.7) days vs (18.2 ± 3.0) days, F = 9.11, p = 0.0007], and required a shorter time for serum creatinine to return to normal [(45.7 ± 13.4) days vs (33.1 ± 9.4) days vs (31.9 ± 9.8), F = 5.83, p = 0.0069]; while such parameters had no significant differences between SLED/HD group and CVVH/HD group. The adverse events of hypotension and arrhythmia were found in the HD group, while no adverse events were reported in the SLED/HD and CVVH/HD groups. There was no significant difference in the cost of blood purification treatment between the SLED/HD group and HD group.CONCLUSION: The use of SLED, CVVH and HD provided a comparable recovery and survival rates in patients with MODS secondary to wasp stings. Compared to HD, the use of SLED is recommended as a treatment strategy because of the efficacy on recover of renal function, satisfactory safety outcome, as well as the reasonable treatment cost.","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insect Bites and Stings', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Wasps']",31269901,"[['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050'], ['E02.870.150', 'E04.292.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C25.723.127.071', 'C26.176.143'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.835.525'], ['E02.870.300', 'E02.912.800'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.875.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40342,Isolation and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies to digoxin.,"Fab preparations of sheep polyclonal anti-digoxin Abs have proven useful for reversal of the toxic effects of digoxin overdoses in patients. Unfortunately, the use of foreign species proteins in humans is limited because of the potential for immunological responses that include hypersensitivity reactions and acute anaphylaxis. Immunization of recently developed transgenic mice, whose endogenous micro heavy and kappa light chain Ig genes are inactivated and which carry human Ig gene segments, with a digoxin-protein conjugate has enabled us to generate and isolate eight hybridoma cell lines secreting human sequence anti-digoxin mAbs. Six of the mAbs have been partially characterized and shown to have high specificity and low nanomolar affinities for digoxin. In addition, detailed competition binding studies performed with three of these mAbs have shown them to have distinct differences in their digoxin binding, and that all three structural moieties of the drug, the primary digitoxose sugar, steroid, and five-member unsaturated lactone ring, contribute to Ab recognition.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Digoxin', 'Haptens', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Species Specificity']",10438974,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['G12.040', 'G12.122.125'], ['G02.111.570.060.425.079', 'G02.111.570.120.408', 'G12.122.232', 'G12.125'], ['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['D04.210.500.155.580.130.500.436', 'D04.210.500.155.580.130.688', 'D09.408.180.261.436'], ['D23.050.550.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.251.353.485', 'A11.251.600.485'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['D12.644.541.500.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.797', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.790.651.797', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650.500', 'D12.776.377.715.548.797', 'G02.111.570.060.425'], ['E02.319.267.530.490'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.440', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.440'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['G16.824']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15087,Changes in carotenoid content and biosynthetic gene expression in juice sacs of four orange varieties (Citrus sinensis) differing in flesh fruit color.,"The contribution of carotenoid composition to the color range of the fruit juice sacs of four orange varieties (Citrus sinensis) differing in flesh color, namely, Shamouti (normal orange color), Sanguinelli (""blood cultivar"" purple color), Cara Cara navel (pink-reddish), and Huang pi Chen (yellowish color), was investigated. To this end, qualitative and quantitative analyses of carotenoid contents were first performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C30 column and a photodiode array detector in February, at a late developmental fruit stage. Concomitantly, transcript levels of Dxs, the gene controlling the first step of the MEP pathway, and six genes involved in beta,beta-xanthophyll biosynthesis (Psy, Pds, Zds, Lcy-b, Hy-b, and Zep) were determined in August, November, and February. Transcript level measurement was carried out by real-time RT-PCR on total RNA from juice sacs. The four orange varieties displayed different carotenoid profiles. Shamouti and Sanguinelli oranges accumulated mainly beta,beta-xanthophylls as expected in typically colored oranges, whereas Cara Cara navel orange accumulated linear carotenes in addition to cis-violaxanthin. Huang pi Chen fruit flesh orange was characterized by a strong reduction of total carotenoid content. Whereas gene expression was relatively low and similar in August (before color break) in all four varieties, in November (during color break), Dxs, Zds, Hy-b, and Zep expression was higher in Cara Cara and Huang pi Chen oranges. The beta,beta-xanthophyll accumulation observed in February in Shamouti and Sanguinelli oranges was apparently related to the increase of transcript levels of all measured genes (i.e., Dxs, Psy, Pds, Zds, Hy-b, and Zep) except Lcy-b. At this time, however, transcript levels in Cara Cara were rather similar to those found in Sanguinelli, although both showed different carotenoid compositions. The Huang pi Chen phenotype correlated with lower expression of Dxs and Psy genes. These results revealed a general pattern of transcript change in juice sacs of citrus fruit, characterized by an apparent coordination of Dxs and Psy expression and a general increase in mRNA levels of carotenoid biosynthetic genes. These transcript changes correlated well with the beta,beta-xanthophyll accumulation, the normal carotenoid set, observed in Shamouti and Sanguinelli oranges and suggest that the preferential accumulation of linear carotenes in Cara Cara navel and the practical absence of carotenoids in Huang pi Chen oranges were not predominantly due to changes in regulation of carotenoid biosynthetic genes at the transcriptional level.","['Carotenoids', 'Citrus', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Pigmentation', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Species Specificity']",18433104,"[['D02.455.326.271.665.202', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249', 'D02.455.849.131', 'D23.767.261'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.875.177'], ['E05.393.220'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['G05.297'], ['E01.370.600.620', 'G16.690'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['G16.824']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The extent of genetic variation has been examined in patients with AIDS, but little is known regarding the appearance of HIV-1 genetic variation immediately following infection during the primary phase of HIV-1 infection prior to seroconversion.DESIGN: We examined HIV-1 genetic variation during this early phase of HIV-1 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequence analysis of the V4 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequence analysis of the V4 variable region and the CD4-binding domain.RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that extensive sequence variation is seen early after infection, although a predominant HIV-1 species is maintained.CONCLUSIONS: The type of variants that occur are dynamic, changing over time, and the mutations seen are consistent with those expected from random occurrence, unlike the pattern of variation previously reported during later stages of disease.","['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Genetic Variation', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1616650,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['G05.365'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B04.820.650.589.650.350.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G02.111.810.550', 'G05.810.550']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
48268,Classifying single-trial EEG during motor imagery by iterative spatio-spectral patterns learning (ISSPL).,"In most current motor-imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), machine learning is carried out in two consecutive stages: feature extraction and feature classification. Feature extraction has focused on automatic learning of spatial filters, with little or no attention being paid to optimization of parameters for temporal filters that still require time-consuming, ad hoc manual tuning. In this paper, we present a new algorithm termed iterative spatio-spectral patterns learning (ISSPL) that employs statistical learning theory to perform automatic learning of spatio-spectral filters. In ISSPL, spectral filters and the classifier are simultaneously parameterized for optimization to achieve good generalization performance. A detailed derivation and theoretical analysis of ISSPL are given. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed algorithm can correctly identify the discriminative frequency bands, demonstrating the algorithm's superiority over contemporary approaches in classification performance.","['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Humans', 'Imagination', 'Movement', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated']",18714838,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['G17.035.250', 'L01.224.050.375'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['G07.265.216.500.385', 'G11.561.200.500.385'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.188.634'], ['G07.568', 'G11.427.410'], ['L01.399.750']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
12541,"""Man-ing"" up and getting drunk: the role of masculine norms, alcohol intoxication and alcohol-related problems among college men.","Compared to college women, college men face elevated risks for problematic drinking and negative alcohol-related consequences. These risks highlight the critical need to investigate gender issues and risk factors contributing to intoxication and related problems among men. Theoretical models suggest that conforming to masculine norms or the beliefs and expectations of what it means to be a man, may help explain patterns of problematic drinking among men. The current study advances the literature by investigating the association between masculine norms, drinking to intoxication, and alcohol-related consequences among 776 undergraduate males after taking into account the importance of fraternity status and perceived peer norms. Results indicate that fraternity status and higher perceived peer norms regarding drinking increased the risks of getting drunk and experiencing alcohol-related consequences. Specifically, the masculine norms of being a ""playboy"", risk-taking, and winning were risk factors of drinking to intoxication; while, being a ""playboy"", risk-taking, and self-reliance increased the risks of alcohol-related problems. Primacy of work and heterosexual presentation were two masculine norms that were protective of drinking to intoxication. Our findings contribute to important future considerations for prevention, clinical interventions, and public-health implications in college settings.","['Alcohol Drinking', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'California', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Masculinity', 'Peer Group', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Conformity', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Universities', 'Young Adult']",21620570,"[['F01.145.317.269'], ['C25.775.100.175', 'F03.900.100.300'], ['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.813.376', 'F01.393.446.250.750', 'F01.752.747.385.200.750'], ['F01.829.316.483'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.813.625'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['I02.783.830', 'J03.832.830'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

5793,Prostaglandin F2 alpha isopropyl ester versus iloprost phenacyl ester in rabbit and beagle eyes.,"One and 2 micrograms of prostaglandin F2 alpha isopropyl ester (PGF2 alpha -IE) applied topically to the rabbit eye caused a biphasic response. The hypotensive phase was dose-dependent with a maximum reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) of 9.4 +/- 1.7 mmHg at a dose of 2 micrograms. In beagles, 0.4 to 2 micrograms topical PGF2 alpha-IE resulted in a sustained IOP reduction; 2 micrograms produced the maximum reduction of 7-9 mmHg. No initial hypertensive response was observed. Iloprost phenacyl ester (Iloprost-PE) caused a greater decrease in IOP when dissolved in 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (AT) than in saline. In rabbits, doses of 0.1 to 1 microgram in AT caused a biphasic response with a sustained IOP decrease fluctuating between 7 and 8 mmHg. In beagles 1 and 2 micrograms Iloprost-PE resulted in a mean IOP reduction of 5.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg and 5.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg (P less than 0.005), respectively; the decrease persisted for 5 hrs. No initial hypertensive response was observed. In beagles PGF2 alpha-IE induced a strong miosis lasting more than 6 hours; Iloprost-PE had no effect on pupil size. Both PG-esters induced a slight hyperemia in rabbit and beagle eyes. In rabbits Iloprost-PE affects the blood-aqueous barrier more than PGF2 alpha-IE, since higher protein concentrations are seen in the aqueous humor after application of Iloprost-PE. Neither PG-ester had a noticeable effect on aqueous protein in beagles. In rabbits, both PG-esters led to slightly increased aqueous humor cyclic-AMP concentrations.

39520,Variables explaining health-related quality of life in community-dwelling older adults.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although health-related quality of life (HRQL) has been linked to numerous factors in older adults, limited or conflicting studies have investigated variables explaining HRQL in healthy, community-dwelling older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine whether physical activity, gait speed, balance, strength, endurance, and flexibility were associated with HRQL in healthy, community-dwelling older adults.METHODS: Participants of this cross-sectional, correlational research design study included residents of a senior living community, aged 60 years and older who were independent in at least unlimited household ambulation. These residents participated in tests of physical activity, gait speed, balance, strength, endurance, flexibility, and HRQL (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey, SF-36). The physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores of the SF-36 were calculated.RESULTS: Data were collected on 84 participants (mean [SD] age = 78.6 (5.9) years, 54.8% women). Significant correlations were found between the PCS and fast gait speed (FGS) (r = 0.43; p < .001), the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (r = 0.44; p < .001), 8-ft up-and-go (r = -0.34; p = .002), and chair stand (r = 0.37; P = .001). Only body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.30; p = .007) was significantly correlated with MCS. Forward stepwise linear regression analyses were conducted, controlling for age, sex, and BMI, to identify factors associated with the PCS and MCS. In the model using PCS as the dependent variable, FGS accounted for 26% of the variance (R2 change) in PCS over and above age, sex, and BMI (R2 change = 0.03); for the full model, F = 5.37, p = .001. In the regression analysis using MCS as the dependent variable, only the 8-ft up-and-go was retained (R2 change = 0.06) over and above age, sex, and BMI (R2 change = 0.16); for the full model, F = 3.71, p = .01.DISCUSSION: Fast gait speed, balance, and lower body strength were associated with the PCS of the SF-36; however, FGS was the only variable that uniquely contributed to the variance in the PCS. Body mass index was associated with the MCS; however, only balance uniquely contributed to the variance in the MCS. Physical activity was not associated with the PCS or MCS.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the assessment of FGS in community-dwelling older adults to gain insight into physical health status. Interventions directed toward FGS, balance, and BMI may contribute to optimum HRQL in this population.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Strength', 'Physical Fitness', 'Quality of Life', 'Residence Characteristics']",23959246,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['E05.318.308.980.438', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.600.425', 'G11.427.560'], ['G11.427.685', 'I03.450.642.845.054.800', 'N01.400.545'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['N01.224.791', 'N06.850.505.400.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
29863,Infant feeding patterns over the first year of life: influence of family characteristics.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Early eating patterns and behaviors can determine later eating habits and food preferences and they have been related to the development of childhood overweight and obesity. We aimed to identify patterns of feeding in the first year of life and to examine their associations with family characteristics.SUBJECTS/METHODS: Our analysis included 1004 infants from the EDEN mother-child cohort. Feeding practices were assessed through maternal self-report at birth, 4, 8 and 12 months. Principal component analysis was applied to derive patterns from breastfeeding duration, age at complementary food (CF) introduction and type of food used at 1 year. Associations between patterns and family characteristics were analyzed by linear regressions.RESULTS: The main source of variability in infant feeding was characterized by a pattern labeled 'late CF introduction and use of ready-prepared baby foods'. Older, more educated, primiparous women with high monthly income ranked high on this pattern. The second pattern, labeled 'longer breastfeeding, late CF introduction and use of home-made foods' was the closest to infant feeding guidelines. Mothers ranking high on this pattern were older and more educated. The third pattern, labeled 'use of adults' foods' suggests a less age-specific diet for the infants. Mothers ranking high on this pattern were often younger and multiparous. Recruitment center was related to all patterns.CONCLUSIONS: Not only maternal education level and age, but also parity and region are important contributors to the variability in patterns. Further studies are needed to describe associations between these patterns and infant growth and later food preferences.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cohort Studies', 'Educational Status', 'Family Characteristics', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Parity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Self Report']",23299715,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['F01.145.407.199', 'G07.203.650.195', 'G07.203.650.220.500.500', 'G07.203.650.353.199'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['N01.824.196'], ['F01.829.263.315', 'I01.240.361', 'I01.880.853.150.423', 'N01.224.361', 'N01.824.308', 'N06.850.505.400.400'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G07.203.300.525.500', 'J02.500.525.500'], ['G07.203.650.220.500'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['F01.829.263.370.215'], ['G08.686.677', 'G08.686.784.769.472', 'N06.850.490.812.600'], ['E05.318.740.562'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.308.980.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
524,Tafluprost protects rat retinal ganglion cells from apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND: To investigate whether tafluprost, which is a prostaglandin-related compound and an anti-glaucoma drug, has a direct anti-apoptotic effect in cultured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and rat RGCs in retinas with optic nerve crush (ONC).METHODS: RGC-5 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by a serum deprivation and by exogenous glutamate. The level of cell death with or without tafluprost was monitored by an XTT assay and by immunocytochemistry with activated caspase-3. Changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) levels were measured with fluo-4 fluorescence. Rat RGCs were degenerated by ONC. After topical instillation of tafluprost for 7 and 14 days, the numbers of retrograde-labeled RGCs were counted. Retinal flatmounts were subjected to terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining to detect apoptotic cells.RESULTS: Tafluprost dose-dependently promoted RGC-5 cell viability with an optimum concentration of 3 microM (p = 0.006). Tafluprost significantly reduced caspase-3-positive cells and suppressed [Ca(+2)]i evoked by exogenous glutamate. The cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor and KT-5823 partially blocked the rescue effect of tafluprost (p = 0.002). The survival rate of RGCs significantly increased in eyes treated with tafluprost (p = 0.01), and the prevalence of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly decreased 14 days after ONC (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that tafluprost has an anti-apoptotic effect in RGCs.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Carbazoles', 'Caspase 3', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutamic Acid', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Instillation, Drug', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Male', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Ophthalmic Solutions', 'Optic Nerve', 'Prostaglandins F', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Time Factors']",19551401,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D27.505.519.562.249', 'D27.505.696.260.500', 'D27.505.954.411.192'], ['D03.633.100.473.144', 'D03.633.300.148'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126.350.300', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126.350.300', 'D12.644.360.075.405.350.300', 'D12.776.476.075.405.350.300'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G04.346'], ['D27.720.470.305.255', 'E07.206.255'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.150.150', 'D12.644.360.200.150', 'D12.776.476.200.150'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['E05.481'], ['E02.319.267.641'], ['A11.284.149.450', 'A11.284.835.514'], ['G14.440'], ['E04.525.210.560'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['D26.776.708.645', 'D27.505.954.578.645', 'D27.720.752.608'], ['A08.800.800.120.680'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.400', 'D23.469.050.175.725.400'], ['D27.505.519.389.755'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['A08.675.650.850.875', 'A09.371.729.831.875', 'A11.671.650.850.875'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6474,Phosphorus deficiency decreases cell division and elongation in grass leaves.,"Leaf growth in monocotyledons results from the flux of newly born cells out of the division zone and into the adjacent elongation-only zone, where cells reach their final length. We used a kinematic method to analyze the effect of phosphorus nutrition status on cell division and elongation parameters in the epidermis of Lolium perenne. Phosphorus deficiency reduced the leaf elongation rate by 39% due to decreases in the cell production rate (-19%) and final cell length (-20%). The former was solely due to a lower average cell division rate (0.028 versus 0.046 cell cell(-1) h(-1)) and, thus, a lengthened average cell cycle duration (25 versus 15 h). The number of division cycles of the initial cell progeny (five to six) and, as a result, the number of meristematic cells (32-64) and division zone length were independent of phosphorus status. Accordingly, low-phosphorus cells maintained meristematic activity longer. Lack of effect of phosphorus deficiency on meristematic cell length implies that a lower division rate was matched to a lower elongation rate. Phosphorus deficiency did not affect the elongation-only zone length, thus leading to longer cell elongation duration (99 versus 75 h). However, the substantially reduced postmitotic average relative elongation rate (0.045 versus 0.064 mm mm(-1) h(-1)) resulted in shorter mature cells. In summary, phosphorus deficiency did not affect the general controls of cell morphogenesis, but, by slowing down the rates of cell division and expansion, it slowed down its pace.","['Cell Division', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Shape', 'Phosphorus', 'Plant Leaves', 'Poaceae']",16648218,"[['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G04.320'], ['D01.268.666'], ['A18.024.812'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
40644,Mutation and evolution of microsatellite loci in Neurospora.,"The patterns of mutation and evolution at 13 microsatellite loci were studied in the filamentous fungal genus Neurospora. First, a detailed investigation was performed on five microsatellite loci by sequencing each microsatellite, together with its nonrepetitive flanking regions, from a set of 147 individuals from eight species of Neurospora. To elucidate the genealogical relationships among microsatellite alleles, repeat number was mapped onto trees constructed from flanking-sequence data. This approach allowed the potentially convergent microsatellite mutations to be placed in the evolutionary context of the less rapidly evolving flanking regions, revealing the complexities of the mutational processes that have generated the allelic diversity conventionally assessed in population genetic studies. In addition to changes in repeat number, frequent substitution mutations within the microsatellites were detected, as were substitutions and insertion/deletions within the flanking regions. By comparing microsatellite and flanking-sequence divergence, clear evidence of interspecific allele length homoplasy and microsatellite mutational saturation was observed, suggesting that these loci are not appropriate for inferring phylogenetic relationships among species. In contrast, little evidence of intraspecific mutational saturation was observed, confirming the utility of these loci for population-level analyses. Frequency distributions of alleles within species were generally consistent with the stepwise mutational model. By comparing variation within species at the microsatellites and the flanking-sequence, estimated microsatellite mutation rates were approximately 2500 times greater than mutation rates of flanking DNA and were consistent with estimates from yeast and fruit flies. A positive relationship between repeat number and variance in repeat number was significant across three genealogical depths, suggesting that longer microsatellite alleles are more mutable than shorter alleles. To test if the observed patterns of microsatellite variation and mutation could be generalized, an additional eight microsatellite loci were characterized and sequenced from a subset of the same Neurospora individuals.","['Base Sequence', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurospora']",15579682,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.045.250', 'G16.075.250'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['G05.365'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.340.024.850.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['B01.300.107.800.629']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

48776,Modulation of histamine type II receptors on CD8+ T cells by interleukin-2 and cimetidine.,CD8+ T cells are known to play a major role in regulating immune functions under normal and disease conditions. In this study a radioligand binding assay was used to quantitate histamine type II (H2) receptors on activated T cells. The objective was to examine the expression of H2 receptors on T cells during activation with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and treatment with cimetidine. Activated suppressor T cells induced by concanavalin A+IL-2 showed a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in H2 receptors compared to the control nonactivated T cells. The T cells expressing the H2 receptors were identified as CD8+ cells; those among them that had an enhanced level of H2 receptors were identified as CD25+. Treatment of activated suppressor cells with the H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine at a concentration of 10(-5) M significantly reduced the number of H2 receptors. Suppressor cells induced by Con A+IL-2 were able to suppress both IgG and IgM production that was reversible with cimetidine. Incubation of lymphocytes with 50 U/ml IL-2 alone in 3-day culture significantly (p less than 0.005) enhanced H2 receptor expression. These studies demonstrate that activated suppressor T cells that are CD8+CD25+ have enhanced levels of H2 receptors and can be modulated by cimetidine.,"['Antibody Formation', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cimetidine', 'Concanavalin A', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2', 'Receptors, Histamine H2', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory']",1533853,"[['G12.450.050.370.250'], ['D23.050.301.264.894.108', 'D23.101.100.894.108'], ['A11.251'], ['D02.078.370.200', 'D03.383.129.308.130'], ['D12.776.503.499.500', 'D12.776.765.678.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.021', 'D12.644.276.374.480.372', 'D12.776.467.374.465.021', 'D12.776.467.374.480.372', 'D23.529.374.465.155', 'D23.529.374.480.372'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.450.400', 'D12.776.543.750.695.355', 'D12.776.543.750.720.480.400'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.420.320'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.550.500', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.500', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.500', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.500', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.500', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.500'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.550.500.700', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.200.700', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.500.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.500.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.500.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.500.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.500.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
30720,[Serotype profile and antibiotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from nasal carriage in pediatric patients].,"The aim of this study was to determine the serotype profile and antibiotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae from nasal isolates in children. Nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 125 children were cultivated and screened for the presence of S. pneumoniae. Strains were identified according to standard microbiological methods. The isolates were serotyped by the Quellung reaction and resistance patterns were determined by the microdilution method according to NCCLS guidelines. Results indicate an overall pneumococcal carriage rate of 24% (n = 30). The most commonly isolated serotypes were 23F (20%), 6B (20%) and 14 (13%). 73% of isolates were resistant at least to one of the tested antibiotics. 47% of the strains were consistently resistant to penicillin and the serotypes 6B and 23F were frequently associated with this marker. 60% of the strains were resistant to doxycycline, 37% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin, 30% to erythromycin, 23% to cloramphenicol, 7% to ceftriaxone and 3% to cefepime. All strains were sensible to ofloxacin, rifampin and vancomycin. The most common combined resistance patterns were PNC-ERI-TMP/SMX-DOX-CLO-CLI (16.59%) and PNC-DOX (13.27%). The results obtained in this study will allow to orient the empiric therapy for pneumococcal infections and a rational use of antibiotics in clinical practice, as well as the application of an appropriate vaccination program specially adapted to the serotypes more frequently found in children.","['Carrier State', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nose', 'Serotyping', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae']",16562641,"[['N06.850.520.169'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['A01.456.505.733', 'A04.531', 'A09.531'], ['E01.370.225.812.742', 'E01.370.225.875.150.125.890', 'E05.200.812.742', 'E05.200.875.150.125.890', 'E05.478.594.780'], ['C01.150.252.410.890'], ['B03.353.750.737.872.550', 'B03.510.400.800.872.550', 'B03.510.550.737.872.550']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
14209,Fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids and bile acids as determinants of colonic mucosal cell proliferation in humans.,"We studied the correlation between fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), bile acids (BA), and colonic mucosal proliferation in humans on a free diet. Subjects [n = 43: 27 men and 16 women; 61 +/- 7 and 59 +/- 6 (SE) yr old, respectively] were outpatients who previously underwent resection of at least two sporadic colon polyps. Mucosal proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation in vitro in three colorectal biopsies obtained without cathartics and was expressed as labeling index (LI). BA were analyzed in feces by mass spectrometry and SCFA by gas chromatography. We found that increasing levels of BA in feces did not correlate with higher LI. On the contrary, higher levels of SCFA were significantly associated with lower LI in the colonic mucosa (P for trend = 0.02). In conclusion, in humans on a free diet, intestinal proliferation seems to be regulated by the levels of SCFA in feces and not by BA. Because a lower intestinal proliferation is associated with a decreased colon cancer risk, treatments or diets that increase colonic levels of SCFA might be beneficial for colonic mucosa.","['Aged', 'Bile Acids and Salts', 'Cell Division', 'Colon', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Diet', 'Fatty Acids', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",12416258,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D04.210.500.105'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A03.556.124.526.356', 'A03.556.249.249.356'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['D10.251'], ['A12.459'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['M01.060.116.630']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
26211,Retroperitoneal schwannoma extending into the intravertebral foramen.,"A 35-year-old Japanese man first visited the hospital for episodes of numbness in the right medial femoral region and loss of muscular strength in the right thigh. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a 10 x 9-cm well-circumscribed in homogeneous multilayered mass, in contact with the lumbar vertebrae. MRI demonstrated a hypodense and hyperdense mixed mass. Tumor extension into the L(2)/L(3) intravertebral foramen was shown. To avoid spinal cord damage, we chose enucleation of the tumor in the intravertebral foramen. A follow-up CT after 1 year showed no evidence of a recurrent mass.

3932,Effects of sodium intake on lactation and Na levels in body fluids of Blackface ewes.,"1. A low-sodium diet was given to Blackface ewes over two reproductive seasons; the diet provided 3-7 mmol Na daily, except for the period of lactation, when Na intake was increased to around 11 mmol/d. The diet of the control ewes was supplemented with sodium chloride to provide the recommended allowance of about ten times the level in the experimental low-Na diet. 2. Milk production was assessed during the first 2 months of lactation from incremental changes in the live weight of lambs during controlled sucking periods. Na and potassium were determined in milk and also in plasma, saliva and urine. 3. Neither yield nor concentration of Na and K in milk was affected by the level of Na in the diet. These results were supported by the similarity in live-weight gain of lambs in both years regardless of diet. 4. Plasma Na and K concentrations were not affected by the level of dietary Na. Na concentration in saliva and urine was significantly lower in the treated than in the control ewes, and K concentration in saliva was significantly higher.","['Animals', 'Body Fluids', 'Female', 'Lactation', 'Milk', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Potassium', 'Pregnancy', 'Sheep', 'Sodium', 'Sodium, Dietary']",3676195,"[['B01.050'], ['A12.207'], ['G08.686.523', 'G08.686.702.500'], ['A12.200.455', 'A12.790', 'G07.203.100.700', 'G07.203.300.350.525', 'J02.200.700', 'J02.500.350.525'], ['G02.640'], ['D01.268.549.550', 'D01.268.557.575', 'D01.552.528.652', 'D01.552.547.650'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['D01.857.875']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

14288,Lifetime burden of mood swings and activation of brain norepinephrine turnover in patients with treatment-refractory depressive illness.,"BACKGROUND: We tested if duration and intensity of episodes in treatment-resistant affectively ill patients were related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of monoamine metabolites.METHOD: In retrospective life charts were recorded every previous episode of 37 patients with severe treatment-refractory affective disorders. 'Accumulated burden of mood swings' (ABMS, sum of each episode length x episode depth) was used to estimate the accumulated illness burden. Homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were analyzed in CSF of all patients and compared with 27 healthy controls. Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis.RESULTS: CSF MHPG contributed strongly significant and positively to the ABMS.LIMITATIONS: The retrospective nature of the study.CONCLUSION: CSF concentrations of MHPG is positively related to ABMS over life.

40598,Pathogenesis of schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations: a neural model.,"We implement and study a computational model of Stevens' theory of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This theory hypothesizes that the onset of schizophrenia is associated with reactive synaptic regeneration in brain regions that receive degenerating temporal lobe projections. Concentrating on one such area, the frontal cortex, we model a frontal module as an associative memory neural network whose input synapses represent incoming temporal projections. Modeling Stevens' hypothesized pathological synaptic changes in this framework results in adverse side effects similar to hallucinations and delusions seen in schizophrenia: spontaneous, stimulus-independent retrieval of stored memories focused on just a few of the stored patterns. These could account for the delusions and hallucinations that occur in schizophrenia without any apparent external trigger and for their tendency to concentrate on a few central cognitive and perceptual themes. The model explains why the positive symptoms of schizophrenia tend to wane as the disease progresses, why delayed therapeutic intervention leads to a much slower response, and why delusions and hallucinations may persist for a long time when they do occur.","['Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Delusions', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Hallucinations', 'Humans', 'Mental Recall', 'Models, Neurological', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Net', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Neural Pathways', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology', 'Synapses', 'Temporal Lobe']",8685653,"[['A08.186.211'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['F01.145.126.200'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['C10.597.606.762.300', 'C23.888.592.604.764.300', 'F01.700.750.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425.540.641'], ['E05.599.395.642'], ['C23.550.737'], ['A08.511'], ['G11.561.585', 'G16.762.611'], ['G17.485', 'L01.224.050.375.605'], ['A08.612'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['F03.700.750'], ['F04.824'], ['A08.850', 'A11.284.149.165.420.780'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.863']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4818,Prostate secretions from men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome inhibit proinflammatory mediators.,"PURPOSE: In the past numerous chemokines have been noted in the expressed prostatic secretions of patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. We examined the functional effects of chemokines in expressed prostatic secretions of patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the functional effects of expressed prostatic secretions on human monocytes by examining monocyte chemotaxis in response to monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a major chemoattractant previously identified in chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome cases. We determined effects on cellular signaling by quantifying intracellular calcium increase in monocytes and nuclear factor-êB activation in normal prostate epithelial cells.RESULTS: Results show that the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in expressed prostatic secretions is nonfunctional with an inability to mediate human monocyte chemotaxis, or mediate signaling in monocytes or prostate epithelial cells. This lack of functionality could be extended to other proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1â and tumor necrosis factor-á, when incubated with expressed prostatic secretions from patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The mechanism underlying this apparent ability to modulate proinflammatory cytokines involves heat labile extracellular proteases that mediate the inhibition of immune and prostate epithelial cell function.CONCLUSIONS: These results may have implications for the design of specific diagnostic and therapeutic methods targeted toward the complete resolution of prostate inflammatory insults.","['Chemokine CCL2', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Male', 'Prostate', 'Prostatitis']",20723928,"[['D12.644.276.374.200.110.990.600', 'D12.776.467.374.200.110.990.600', 'D23.125.300.110.990.600', 'D23.469.200.110.990.600', 'D23.529.374.200.110.990.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D23.469'], ['A05.360.444.575', 'A10.336.707'], ['C12.294.565.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33146,Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 Causes Antibody Deficiency.,"PURPOSE: Determining the monogenic cause of antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation in a non-consanguineous family with healthy parents, two affected children, and one unaffected child.METHODS: Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed in the index family. WES results were confirmed by Sanger Sequencing. Dried plasma spots of the male patient and his mother were analyzed for ADA2 enzymatic activity.RESULTS: Following data analysis of WES, we found a compound heterozygous mutation in CECR1 (encoding adenosine deaminase 2, ADA2) that segregated in the two affected children. Enzyme activity measurement confirmed a severely diminished ADA2 activity in our patient. The 32 year old index patient was suffering from recurrent respiratory infections and was previously diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), showing no signs of vasculitis. His sister had a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like phenotype and died at age 17.CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of ADA2 (DADA2) has been reported to cause vasculopathy and early-onset stroke.

42759,Chronic nicotine treatment eliminates asymmetry in striatal glucose utilization following unilateral transection of the mesostriatal dopamine pathway in rats.,"Partial hemitransection was performed through a knife lesion at the meso-diencephalic level in rats to sever the mesostriatal dopamine system. During the subsequent 2 weeks the animals received 0.125 mg/kg/h of nicotine continuously via an osmotic minipump implanted s.c. To achieve prompt high nicotine levels, 4 i.p. injections of 0.5 mg/kg nicotine were, in addition, given during the first 2 h following the lesion. The total treatment corresponded to a mean plasma level of 50 ng/ml nicotine, measured at the end of the experiment. Control animals received corresponding volumes of 0.9% saline. Quantitative autoradiographic analysis of the glucose utilization in the caudate nucleus using Sokoloff's [14C]2-deoxyglucose method demonstrated a 16% side-to-side difference in the lesioned control animals, whereas the asymmetry was counteracted by the nicotine treatment. Although there was an overall tendency to a lower rate of glucose utilization (by 6%) in the nicotine-treated animals compared to the controls receiving saline only, the difference was not statistically significant. The eliminated asymmetry probably reflects an increased survival of the dopamine neurons and/or of striatal nerve cells on the lesioned side due to protective effects of nicotine resulting from desensitization of nicotinic-type cholinergic receptors following continuous administration of the drug.","['Animals', 'Caudate Nucleus', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Corpus Striatum', 'Cotinine', 'Denervation', 'Deoxyglucose', 'Dopamine', 'Glucose', 'Male', 'Nicotine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",2812507,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487.550.184'], ['E05.196.181.349'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487'], ['D03.383.773.812.180'], ['E04.525.210'], ['D09.254.229'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D03.132.760.570', 'D03.383.725.518'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
10100,Altered â-catenin expression in oral mucosal dysplasia: a comparative study.,"OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to investigate the â-catenin expression in oral leukoplakia (OL) with different degrees of epithelial dysplasia and normal oral mucosa.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 39 OL (mild dysplasia n=19, moderate dysplasia n=13, and severe dysplasia n=7), and 10 normal oral mucosa (control group) were submitted to immunohistochemical reactions to anti-â-catenin primary antibody. A qualitative â-catenin analysis was performed based on the percentage of positive cells. The cellular location and the epithelial layer were also considered. The Chi-square test and the Fisher's exact test were used to verify possible differences in the â-catenin expression among the OL groups. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: Membranous expression of â-catenin in parabasal and basal layers was gradually lost in the higher degrees of epithelial dysplasia. In normal oral mucosa, â-catenin was detected only in the cytoplasmic membrane. However, a significant increase in cytoplasmic â-catenin could be observed between mild and moderate dysplasia (Fisher Exact test - p<0.001) and between mild and severe dysplasia (p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The â-catenin cytoplasmic expression observed in this study may represent the initial stage of modifications in the E-cadherin-catenin complex, along with morphological cellular changes.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Membrane', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukoplakia, Oral', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Reference Values', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'beta Catenin']",26537717,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['A11.284.149'], ['A11.436'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['C04.588.443.591.545', 'C04.834.512.513', 'C07.465.530.545', 'C23.300.816.513'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A10.615.550.599', 'A14.549.512'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.440.610', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.440.610', 'E05.200.500.620.760.440.610', 'E05.200.750.600.760.440.610'], ['E05.978.810'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['D12.776.091.249', 'D12.776.220.145.500', 'D12.776.930.130']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

26424,Primary malignant melanoma of the vagina.,"BACKGROUND: Primary vaginal melanoma is a rare, highly malignant, and poor prognostic disease.CASE: The 51-year-old patient with diagnosis of vaginal malignant melanoma was referred to our clinic. Since detection of pervasive brown lesions in the vagina total vaginectomy was performed. At pathological investigation melanoma was not determined. Immunotherapy was administered adjuvantly. Paraaortic lymph node metastasis was seen on the ninth month after total vaginectomy and the metastatic lymph nodes were excised. Cisplatin and tremozolamide chemotherapy was administered for six cycles after surgery. The patient is alive and disease-free at 18th month of the diagnosis of the disease.CONCLUSION: The impact of therapy on outcome of primary vaginal malign melanomas is poorly understood. Improved clinical outcomes were associated with surgical removal of gross disease whenever possible. Because of the low rate of lymph node metastasis, elective pelvic lymph node dissection is not mandatory. We presented a case of FIGO stage I primary vaginal malignant melanoma, which metastasized to the paraaortic lymph nodes 9 months after the primary operation.","['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cisplatin', 'Dacarbazine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Melanoma', 'Middle Aged', 'Temozolomide', 'Vaginal Neoplasms']",19242707,"[['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D01.210.375', 'D01.625.125', 'D01.710.100'], ['D02.925.200', 'D03.383.129.308.240'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.250', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.250', 'D23.529.374.440.890.250'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510', 'C04.557.665.510'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.925.200.500', 'D03.383.129.308.240.500'], ['C04.588.945.418.955', 'C13.351.500.894.834', 'C13.351.937.418.937']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
19164,Is transcutaneous oxygen tension independent of variations in blood flow and in arterial blood pressure?,"Whether transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) is independent of minor variations in perfusion under the TcPO2 electrode, as is claimed, was studied in 18 feet of 16 young healthy adults. The TcPO2 electrode was mounted on the dorsum of the foot and operated at 43 degrees C, while the blood pressure was changed by elevating and lowering the foot. During elevation the mean arterial blood pressure decreased corresponding to the hydrostatic pressure of the column of blood between the heart and the position of the foot. In every experiment TcPO2 decreased when the foot was elevated at an average rate of 1.2% per millimeter Hg change in mean arterial blood pressure. TcPO2 was negatively correlated to blood flow in normal unheated tissue, but significantly and positively correlated to blood flow in the heated, vasodilated tissue under the TcPO2 electrode. In the heated tissue normal blood flow regulation was abolished, and the perfusion under the electrode was mainly determined by the arterial blood pressure. It is concluded that TcPO2 in adults--and probably also in neonates--is affected by the minor or large variations in the perfusion under the electrode caused by fluctuations in arterial blood pressure.","['Adult', 'Blood Gas Analysis', 'Blood Pressure', 'Electrodes', 'Female', 'Foot', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oxygen', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Respiration', 'Skin']",7159703,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.100', 'E01.370.386.700.100', 'E05.200.124.100.100'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E07.305.250'], ['A01.378.610.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['G09.330.100.780'], ['G09.772.705'], ['A17.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

15629,Antibody mimics based on human fibronectin type three domain engineered for thermostability and high-affinity binding to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor two.,"The tenth human fibronectin type three domain ((10)Fn3) is a small (10 kDa), extremely stable and soluble protein with an immunoglobulin-like fold, but without cysteine residues. Selections from (10)Fn3-based libraries of proteins with randomized loops have yielded high-affinity, target-specific antibody mimics. However, little is known about the biophysical properties of such antibody mimics, which will determine their suitability for in vitro and medical applications. We characterized target binding and biophysical properties of two related (10)Fn3-based antibody mimics that bind vascular endothelial growth factor receptor two (VEGF-R2). The first antibody mimic, which has a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 13 nM, is highly stable [melting temperature (T(m))=62 degrees C] and soluble, whereas the second, which binds VEGF-R2 with 40 x higher affinity, is less stable (T(m) < 40 degrees C) and relatively insoluble. We used our understanding of these two (10)Fn3 derivatives and of wild-type (10)Fn3 structure to engineer the next generation of antibody mimics, which have an improved combination of high affinity (K(d)=0.59 nM), stability (T(m)=53 degrees C) and solubility. Our findings illustrate that (10)Fn3-based antibody mimics can be engineered for favorable biophysical properties even when 20% of the wild-type (10)Fn3 sequence is mutated in order to satisfy target-binding requirements.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Fibronectins', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Engineering', 'Solubility', 'Thermodynamics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2']",16087651,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114'], ['D12.776.377.715.390', 'D12.776.395.550.350', 'D12.776.543.550.350', 'D12.776.860.300.450'], ['G01.906.595.543', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.380', 'G16.500.750.775.710.380', 'N06.230.300.100.725.232', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.560', 'G05.545', 'G16.012.750.500'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G01.154.651.750.500', 'G02.111.688.750.500'], ['E05.393.420.601'], ['G02.805'], ['G01.906'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.950.200', 'D12.776.543.750.630.750.200', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.910.200']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
16405,Neutrophil elastase contributes to the development of ischemia-reperfusion-induced liver injury by decreasing endothelial production of prostacyclin in rats.,"We previously reported that nitric oxide (NO) derived from endothelial NO synthase (NOS) increased endothelial prostacyclin (PGI(2)) production in rats subjected to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). The present study was undertaken to determine whether neutrophil elastase (NE) decreases endothelial production of PGI(2), thereby contributing to the development of I/R-induced liver injury by decreasing hepatic tissue blood flow in rats. Hepatic tissue levels of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), a stable metabolite of PGI(2), were transiently increased and peaked at 1 h after reperfusion, followed by a gradual decrease until 3 h after reperfusion. Sivelestat sodium hydrochloride and L-658,758, two NE inhibitors, reduced I/R-induced liver injury. These substances inhibited the decreases in hepatic tissue levels of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) at 2 and 3 h after reperfusion but did not affect the levels at 1 h after reperfusion. These NE inhibitors significantly increased hepatic tissue blood flow from 1 to 3 h after reperfusion. Both hepatic I/R-induced increases in the accumulation of neutrophils and the microvascular permeability were inhibited by these two NE inhibitors. Protective effects induced by the two NE inhibitors were completely reversed by pretreatment with nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of NOS, or indomethacin. Administration of iloprost, a stable derivative of PGI(2), produced effects similar to those induced by NE inhibitors. These observations strongly suggest that NE might play a critical role in the development of I/R-induced liver injury by decreasing endothelial production of NO and PGI(2), leading to a decrease in hepatic tissue blood flow resulting from inhibition of vasodilation and induction of activated neutrophil-induced microvascular injury.","['6-Ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha', 'Animals', 'Capillary Permeability', 'Cephalosporins', 'Chemokines, CXC', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors', 'Endothelium', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Epoprostenol', 'Glycine', 'Iloprost', 'Indomethacin', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukocyte Elastase', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Male', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III', 'Peroxidase', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Sulfonamides', 'Transaminases', 'Vasodilator Agents']",15246960,"[['D10.251.355.255.550.400.350', 'D10.251.355.325.450', 'D23.469.050.175.725.400.350'], ['B01.050'], ['G03.143.330', 'G09.330.165'], ['D02.065.589.099.249', 'D02.886.665.074', 'D03.633.100.300.249'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.120', 'D12.776.467.374.200.120', 'D23.125.300.120', 'D23.469.200.120', 'D23.529.374.200.120'], ['D27.505.519.389.310', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030.500', 'D27.505.954.329.030.500'], ['A10.272.491'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.550.500', 'D23.469.050.175.725.550.500'], ['D12.125.481'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.775.125', 'D23.469.050.175.725.775.125', 'D23.469.700.275'], ['D03.633.100.473.420'], ['D12.644.276', 'D12.776.467', 'D23.529'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.560.500', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.560.500'], ['A03.620'], ['G09.330.100.881.552'], ['D12.125.068.050.525', 'D12.125.095.104.525'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772.750'], ['D08.811.682.732.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['C14.907.725', 'C23.550.767.877'], ['D02.065.884', 'D02.886.590.700'], ['D08.811.913.477.700'], ['D27.505.954.411.918']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
14908,Protective effect of oxymatrine on chronic rat heart failure.,"Oxymatrine is one of the alkaloids extracted from the Chinese herb Sophora japonica (Sophora flavescens Ait.) with anti-inflammatory, immune reaction inhibiting, antiviral, and hepatocyte and antihepatic fibrosis protective activities. However, the effect of oxymatrine on heart failure is not yet known. In this study, the effect of oxymatrine on heart failure was investigated using a Sprague-Dawley rat model of chronic heart failure. Morphological findings showed that in the group treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg of oxymatrine; intermyofibrillar lysis disappeared, myofilaments were orderly, closely and evenly arranged; and mitochondria contained tightly packed cristae compared with the heart failure group. We investigated the cytosolic Ca(2+) transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content, and assessed the expression of ryanodine receptor (RyR2), SR-Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA2a), and L-type Ca(2+) channel (dihydropyridine receptor, DHPR). We found that the cytosolic Ca(2+) transients were markedly increased in amplitude in the medium- (ÄF/F (0) = 26.22 ± 2.01) and high-dose groups (ÄF/F (0) = 29.49 ± 1.17) compared to the heart failure group (ÄF/F (0) = 12.12 ± 1.35, P < 0.01), with changes paralleled by a significant increase in the SR Ca(2+) content (medium-dose group: ÄF/F (0) = 32.20 ± 1.67, high-dose group: ÄF/F (0) = 32.57 ± 1.29, HF: ÄF/F (0) = 17.26 ± 1.05, P < 0.01). Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression of SERCA2a and cardiac DHPR was significantly increased in the medium- and high-dose group compared with the heart failure rats. These findings suggest that oxymatrine could improve heart failure by improving the cardiac function and that this amelioration is associated with upregulation of SERCA2a and DHPR.","['Alkaloids', 'Animals', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Channels, L-Type', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Chronic Disease', 'Heart Failure', 'Male', 'Mitochondria, Heart', 'Quinolizines', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases']",21691940,"[['D03.132'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.411.097'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.400', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.400', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.400'], ['G02.111.820.800.100', 'G03.143.500.100', 'G04.835.800.100'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['C14.280.434'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564.627.603', 'A11.284.835.626.627.603'], ['D03.633.100.834'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.800', 'D12.776.210.500.800', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.800', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.800'], ['A10.690.552.500.500.850', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.248.310.800'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.250.500', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.500.500', 'D12.776.157.530.813.250.500', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.500.500', 'D12.776.543.585.813.250.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

36963,Severe deficiency of VWF-cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) activity defines a distinct population of thrombotic microangiopathy patients.,"BACKGROUND: Severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity is a biologic risk factor for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). It was hypothesized that severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is associated with a distinct TMA subpopulation.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: ADAMTS13 activity before treatment was determined retrospectively in 107 adult TMA patients treated with plasma exchange. Patients were not clinically categorized, but divided between severely deficient (n = 50) and nonseverely deficient (n = 57) ADAMTS13 activity. Laboratory and clinical factors before treatment were compared between the groups.RESULTS: Median PLT counts were 44,000 per micro L in nonseverely deficient ADAMTS13 patients and 13,000 per micro L in severely deficient ADAMTS13 patients (p < 0.001). Median serum creatinine levels were 2.7 mg per dL in nonseverely deficient patients and 1.2 mg per dL in severely deficient patients (p < 0.001). In surviving patients, median plasma exchange procedures were 9 in nonseverely deficient patients and 14.5 in severely deficient patients (p < 0.01). Rates of relapse following remission were 4 of 47 in nonseverely deficient patients and 16 of 46 in severely deficient patients (p < 0.01). Among analyzed factors only mortality rates were not significantly different.CONCLUSION: In a heterogeneous population of TMA patients treated with plasma exchange, ADAMTS13 activity defined two subpopulations with distinct clinical and laboratory features. These results suggest that TMA with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is a distinct pathologic process.","['ADAM Proteins', 'ADAMTS13 Protein', 'Creatinine', 'Humans', 'Metalloendopeptidases', 'Plasma Exchange', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombosis']",14962303,"[['D08.811.277.656.675.374.102', 'D09.400.430.500', 'D12.776.395.033'], ['D08.811.277.656.675.374.102.500.813', 'D09.400.430.500.500.813', 'D12.776.395.033.500.813', 'D12.776.860.300.085.813'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374'], ['E02.095.135.750', 'E02.120.770.500', 'E02.912.715.500', 'E04.292.869.500'], ['E02.860'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C14.907.355.830']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
39391,Simulation of arrhythmogenic effect of rogue RyRs in failing heart by using a coupled model.,"Cardiac cells with heart failure are usually characterized by impairment of Ca(2+) handling with smaller SR Ca(2+) store and high risk of triggered activities. In this study, we developed a coupled model by integrating the spatiotemporal Ca(2+) reaction-diffusion system into the cellular electrophysiological model. With the coupled model, the subcellular Ca(2+) dynamics and global cellular electrophysiology could be simultaneously traced. The proposed coupled model was then applied to study the effects of rogue RyRs on Ca(2+) cycling and membrane potential in failing heart. The simulation results suggested that, in the presence of rogue RyRs, Ca(2+) dynamics is unstable and Ca(2+) waves are prone to be initiated spontaneously. These release events would elevate the membrane potential substantially which might induce delayed afterdepolarizations or triggered action potentials. Moreover, the variation of membrane potential depolarization is indicated to be dependent on the distribution density of rogue RyR channels. This study provides a new possible arrhythmogenic mechanism for heart failure from subcellular to cellular level.","['Action Potentials', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac', 'Calcium', 'Computer Simulation', 'Diffusion', 'Electrophysiology', 'Heart Failure', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Models, Statistical', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Muscle Cells', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Time Factors']",23056145,"[['G04.580.100', 'G07.265.675.100', 'G11.561.570.100'], ['C14.280.067', 'C23.550.073'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['L01.224.160'], ['G01.202', 'G02.196'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['C14.280.434'], ['A07.541.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.154.535', 'G04.580', 'G07.265.675', 'G11.561.570'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['E05.599'], ['A11.620'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.800', 'D12.776.210.500.800', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.800', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.800'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
46185,Osmotic water transport with glucose in GLUT2 and SGLT.,"Carrier-mediated water cotransport is currently a favored explanation for water movement against an osmotic gradient. The vestibule within the central pore of Na(+)-dependent cotransporters or GLUT2 provides the necessary precondition for an osmotic mechanism, explaining this phenomenon without carriers. Simulating equilibrative glucose inflow via the narrow external orifice of GLUT2 raises vestibular tonicity relative to the external solution. Vestibular hypertonicity causes osmotic water inflow, which raises vestibular hydrostatic pressure and forces water, salt, and glucose into the outer cytosolic layer via its wide endofacial exit. Glucose uptake via GLUT2 also raises oocyte tonicity. Glucose exit from preloaded cells depletes the vestibule of glucose, making it hypotonic and thereby inducing water efflux. Inhibiting glucose exit with phloretin reestablishes vestibular hypertonicity, as it reequilibrates with the cytosolic glucose and net water inflow recommences. Simulated Na(+)-glucose cotransport demonstrates that active glucose accumulation within the vestibule generates water flows simultaneously with the onset of glucose flow and before any flow external to the transporter caused by hypertonicity in the outer cytosolic layers. The molar ratio of water/glucose flow is seen now to relate to the ratio of hydraulic and glucose permeability rather than to water storage capacity of putative water carriers.","['Computer Simulation', 'Diffusion', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Transporter Type 2', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Pressure', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sodium-Glucose Transport Proteins', 'Water']",18234816,"[['L01.224.160'], ['G01.202', 'G02.196'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D12.776.157.530.500.500.750', 'D12.776.157.530.937.563.750', 'D12.776.543.585.500.500.750', 'D12.776.543.585.937.625.750'], ['E05.599.495'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G01.374.715.578', 'G02.640.249', 'G02.723.661'], ['G01.374.715'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['D12.776.157.530.450.625.437', 'D12.776.157.530.500.750', 'D12.776.543.585.450.625.562', 'D12.776.543.585.500.750'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5249,A proteasome inhibitor confers cardioprotection.,"OBJECTIVE: In several cell types, proteasome inhibitors like carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132) induce the 72 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp72) and exert cell protective effects. However, data in cardiomyocytes are currently lacking.METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effects of MG132 in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. MG132 time- and concentration-dependently induced Hsp72 and Hsp32 at mRNA and protein levels. Although Hsp60 mRNA was induced, Hsp60 protein levels were not altered. MG132 activated p38 MAP kinase already after 0.5 h. Hsp mRNA induction started after 2 h of MG132 treatment. Subsequently, Hsp72 and Hsp32 protein levels were increased after 4 h. SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, concentration-dependently attenuated MG132-induced Hsp72-and Hsp32-elevations (by 59% and 41%, respectively, at 1 microM SB202190). In contrast, herbimycin A, a known inductor of Hsp72 in cardiomyocytes, enhanced the MG132-induced Hsp72 and Hsp32 expression even further: additionally applied 2 microM herbimycin A induced Hsp72 and Hsp32 about 2-fold higher than 1 microM MG132 alone. MG132 (1 microM) decreased the hyperthermia- or hydrogen peroxide-induced release of lactate dehydrogenase by 45% and by 35%, respectively (P<0.05, n=5). MG132 (1 microM) prolonged the spontaneous beating time of cardiomyocytes at 46 degrees C from 5+/-2 min (control hyperthermia) to 28+/-5 min (P<0.05, n=4). Thus, inhibition of the proteasome function by MG132 protects cardiomyocytes against hyperthermic or oxidative injury. This protective effect and Hsp induction were abolished by 1 microM SB202190.CONCLUSION: Proteasome inhibition results in p38 MAP kinase-dependent induction of Hsp72 and Hsp32 and might be a novel cardioprotective modality.","['Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fever', 'HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', 'Imidazoles', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leupeptins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Myocardium', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Papillary Muscles', 'Pyridines', 'Quinones', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rifabutin', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",12062370,"[['B01.050'], ['D02.806.250'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A11.251'], ['D27.505.519.389.745.325'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['C23.888.119.344'], ['D12.776.580.216.375.202'], ['D12.776.580.216'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.410'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.410.500'], ['D03.383.129.308'], ['E05.481'], ['D02.065.589.327', 'D04.345.295'], ['D12.644.456.580'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567', 'D12.644.360.450', 'D12.776.476.450'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['A02.633.580.680', 'A07.541.510.619', 'A07.541.704.750'], ['D03.383.725'], ['D02.806'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D03.633.400.811.650', 'D04.345.295.750.650'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.843', 'D12.644.360.450.835', 'D12.776.476.450.835']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15682,Cannabis (medical marijuana) treatment for motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson disease: an open-label observational study.,"OBJECTIVE: The use of cannabis as a therapeutic agent for various medical conditions has been well documented. However, clinical trials in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) have yielded conflicting results. The aim of the present open-label observational study was to assess the clinical effect of cannabis on motor and non-motor symptoms of PD.METHODS: Twenty-two patients with PD attending the motor disorder clinic of a tertiary medical center in 2011 to 2012 were evaluated at baseline and 30 minutes after smoking cannabis using the following battery: Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, visual analog scale, present pain intensity scale, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, as well as Medical Cannabis Survey National Drug and Alcohol Research Center Questionnaire.RESULTS: Mean (SD) total score on the motor Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale score improved significantly from 33.1 (13.8) at baseline to 23.2 (10.5) after cannabis consumption (t = 5.9; P < 0.001). Analysis of specific motor symptoms revealed significant improvement after treatment in tremor (P < 0.001), rigidity (P = 0.004), and bradykinesia (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: There was also significant improvement of sleep and pain scores. No significant adverse effects of the drug were observed. The study suggests that cannabis might have a place in the therapeutic armamentarium of PD. Larger, controlled studies are needed to verify the results.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypokinesia', 'Male', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Rigidity', 'Pain Measurement', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sleep', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tremor']",24614667,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.597.350.400', 'C23.888.592.350.400'], ['D26.528'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05.651.504', 'C10.597.613.550.500', 'C23.888.592.608.550.500'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['C10.228.140.079.862.500', 'C10.228.662.600.400', 'C10.574.928.750'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['F02.830.855', 'G11.561.803'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['C10.597.350.850', 'C23.888.592.350.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

45955,Creating visual differences: Methamphetamine users perceptions of anti-meth campaigns.,"BACKGROUND: Because of increased law enforcement and subsequent media attention, methamphetamine users appear in the public's imagination as diseased, zombie-like White trash. We explore methamphetamine users' perceptions about whether the images, people, and situations in anti-methamphetamine campaigns reflect their own lives and experiences using meth.METHODS: To explore these perceptions, we used photo-elicitation interviews with 47 people who used methamphetamine (30 former and 17 active). Specifically, we presented participants with images from the Faces of Meth and the Montana Meth Project campaigns to stimulate discussion.RESULTS: We found that participants believed these ads did not reflect their personal experiences and consequently were ineffective at curtailing their own methamphetamine use. They believed that the ads represented a certain type of methamphetamine user, particularly those they defined as dysfunctional users. They created symbolic boundaries between themselves and those portrayed in the ads to show how they differed, which allowed them to believe that the ads were not relevant to their experiences.CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that there are unintended consequences to inauthentic/dramatic imagery. Participants did not believe they were like those in the ads-thus saw no reason to quit or seek help. Consequently, overly stigmatizing portraits of users may act as barriers to desistence. The findings have implications for designing anti-methamphetamine campaigns.","['Adult', 'Advertising', 'Drug Users', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methamphetamine', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",27768994,"[['M01.060.116'], ['J01.219.687.274', 'L01.143.050'], ['M01.169'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.092.471.683.152.619'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
38757,Risk factors for protracted postoperative length of stay after lower extremity bypass for critical limb ischemia.,"BACKGROUND: Compared with other common chronic conditions, admissions for management of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are associated with prolonged hospitalizations. Length of stay (LOS) is one of many metrics receiving increased attention in the current focus on efficient healthcare delivery. Our objective was to characterize LOS among patients with severe PAD, those undergoing surgical bypass for critical limb ischemia (CLI), and identify risk factors for protracted postoperative LOS.METHODS: Patient data from the 2007 to 2009 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were used to develop a database consisting of patients undergoing bypass surgery for CLI (n = 4,894). Protracted postoperative LOS was defined as the top quartile of days hospitalized from surgery to discharge. Preoperative risk factors with significant association (Pearson chi-squared test; P < 0.05) were used to develop a logistic regression model for protracted postoperative LOS.RESULTS: Average postoperative LOS was 7.5 days (median 6 days). The top quartile of postoperative LOS, >8 days, was used to define protracted LOS. Independent preoperative risk factors for protracted postoperative LOS included demographic characteristics (advanced age and non-Caucasian race), comorbidities, and medical history (e.g., obesity, dialysis dependence, severe cardiac and pulmonary disease, and bleeding disorders). Indicators of PAD severity (e.g., distal target sites, open wounds or gangrene, and prior arterial surgery) were also independent predictors of protracted LOS after surgery. The greatest predictors of extended postoperative LOS were prolonged preoperative hospitalization (OR 2.2 [95% CI: 1.8-2.6], P < 0.001) and preoperative dependent functional status (OR 2.0 [95% CI: 1.7-2.3], P < 0.001 for partial dependence; OR 2.8 [95% CI: 1.8-4.3], P < 0.001 for totally dependent status), where OR and CI stand for odds ratio and confidence interval.CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identify preoperative risk factors for protracted postoperative LOS after infrainguinal bypass for CLI. These findings provide an important evidence basis for ongoing efforts to reduce healthcare spending and facilitate provision of efficient health care. Future efforts will include prospective identification of patients at high risk for protracted postoperative LOS and targeted multidisciplinary efforts to reduce associated costs without sacrificing healthcare quality.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Critical Illness', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ischemia', 'Length of Stay', 'Logistic Models', 'Lower Extremity', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Discharge', 'Peripheral Arterial Disease', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'Vascular Grafting']",24517986,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['C23.550.291.625'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400', 'L01.470.750.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.513'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['A01.378.610'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['E02.760.169.125', 'E02.760.400.610', 'N02.421.585.169.125', 'N02.421.585.400.610', 'N04.590.233.727.210.125'], ['C14.907.137.126.307.500', 'C14.907.617.671'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['E04.100.814.868']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

In a specifically designed, shielded experimental chamber, the circularly polarized electromagnetic field applied was transmitted by an antenna positioned 10 cm behind the head of upright sitting test persons. The carrier frequency of 900 MHz was pulsed with 217 Hz (average power flux density 1 W/m2). In double blind trials, each test person underwent a total of 20 randomly allotted 4 hour periods of exposure and sham exposure, equally distributed at day and night.

35871,Assay Conditions Influence Affinities of Rat Organic Cation Transporter 1: Analysis of Mutagenesis in the Modeled Outward-Facing Cleft by Measuring Effects of Substrates and Inhibitors on Initial Uptake.,"The effects of mutations in the modeled outward-open cleft of rat organic cation transporter 1 (rOCT1) on affinities of substrates and inhibitors were investigated. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were stably transfected with rOCT1 or rOCT1 mutants, and uptake of the substrates 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium+ (MPP+) and tetraethylammonium+ (TEA+) or inhibition of MPP+ uptake by the nontransported inhibitors tetrabutylammonium+ (TBuA+), tetrapentylammonium+ (TPeA+), and corticosterone was measured. Uptake measurements were performed on confluent cell layers using a 2-minute incubation or in dissociated cells using incubation times of 1, 5, or 10 seconds. With both methods, different apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) values, different IC50 values, and varying effects of mutations were determined. In addition, varying IC50 values for the inhibition of MPP+ uptake and varying effects of mutations were obtained when different MPP+ concentrations far below the apparent Km value were used for uptake measurements. Eleven mutations were investigated by measuring initial uptake in dissociated cells and employing 0.1 µM MPP+ for uptake during inhibition experiments. Altered affinities for substrates and/or inhibitors were observed when Phe160, Trp218, Arg440, Leu447, and Asp475 were mutated. The mutations resulted in changes of apparent Km values for TEA+ and/or MPP+ Mutation of Trp218 and Asp475 led to altered IC50 values for TBuA+, TPeA+, and corticosterone, whereas the mutation of Phe160 and Leu447 changed the IC50 values for two inhibitors. Thereby amino acids in the outward-facing conformation of rOCT1 could be identified that interact with structurally different inhibitors and probably also with different substrates.","['1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium', 'Animals', 'Catecholamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds', 'Rats', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Xenopus laevis']",29339398,"[['D03.383.725.762.550'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.157.530.562.374.500', 'D12.776.543.585.562.374.500'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G05.558'], ['D01.625.062.500', 'D02.092.877', 'D02.675.276'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['G02.111.835'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.610.500.562']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3760,Recurrent Granulibacter bethesdensis infections and chronic granulomatous disease.,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by frequent infections, most of which are curable. Granulibacter bethesdensis is an emerging pathogen in patients with CGD that causes fever and necrotizing lymphadenitis. However, unlike typical CGD organisms, this organism can cause relapse after clinical quiescence. To better define whether infections were newly acquired or recrudesced, we use comparative bacterial genomic hybridization to characterize 11 isolates obtained from 5 patients with CGD from North and Central America. Genomic typing showed that 3 patients had recurrent infection months to years after apparent clinical cure.

24690,PPAR Agonists: II. Fenofibrate and Tesaglitazar Alter Behaviors Related to Voluntary Alcohol Consumption.,"BACKGROUND: In the accompanying article, we showed that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARá) signaling by fenofibrate and tesaglitazar decreases ethanol (EtOH) consumption in mice. In this study, we determined the role of these PPAR agonists in EtOH-related behaviors and other actions that may be important in regulating EtOH consumption.METHODS: The effects of fenofibrate (150 mg/kg) and tesaglitazar (1.5 mg/kg) were examined on the following responses in male and female C57BL/6J (B6) and B6 ? 129S4 mice: preference for saccharin, EtOH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), conditioned taste aversion (CTA), loss of righting reflex, and withdrawal, acoustic startle reflex, response to novelty, and EtOH clearance. Because the B6 inbred strain usually displays weak EtOH-induced CPP and weak EtOH-induced acute withdrawal, B6 ? 129S4 mice were also studied.RESULTS: Fenofibrate and tesaglitazar decreased the novelty response and increased acute EtOH withdrawal severity, and fenofibrate increased EtOH-induced CTA. Two important factors for EtOH consumption (saccharin preference and EtOH-induced CPP) were not altered by fenofibrate or tesaglitazar. EtOH clearance was increased by both fenofibrate and tesaglitazar. Response to novelty, acute withdrawal, and EtOH clearance show sex differences and could contribute to the reduced EtOH consumption following fenofibrate administration.CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate the complexity of EtOH-dependent and EtOH-independent behaviors that are altered by PPAR agonists and provide evidence for novel behavioral actions of these drugs that may contribute to PPAR-mediated effects on alcohol drinking.","['Alcohol Drinking', 'Alkanesulfonates', 'Animals', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Conditioning, Classical', 'Female', 'Fenofibrate', 'Locomotion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'PPAR alpha', 'Phenylpropionates', 'Reflex, Righting', 'Taste']",26857541,"[['F01.145.317.269'], ['D02.455.326.146.100.050', 'D02.886.645.600.055.050'], ['B01.050'], ['F02.463.425.097', 'F02.463.785.373.173'], ['F02.463.425.179.308'], ['D02.241.081.114.968.500.625', 'D02.355.726.305.625', 'D02.455.426.559.389.134.750', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.654.305.625', 'D02.522.223.750'], ['G07.568.500', 'G11.427.410.568'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.025', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.025', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500.025'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['D12.776.826.239.500'], ['D02.241.223.701'], ['E01.370.376.550.650.695', 'E01.370.600.550.650.695', 'G07.888.875', 'G11.561.731.745'], ['F02.830.816.724', 'G11.561.790.724']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24078,A novel method for amino starch preparation and its adsorption for Cu(II) and Cr(VI).,"A novel method was proposed to prepare amino starch by reacting ethylenediamine with previously synthesized dialdehyde starch. Different factors affecting the preparation, i.e., ethylenediamine concentration, ethylenediamine:dialdehyde starch molar ratio, pH, duration and temperature have been studied. The modified starch was characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The amino starch derivatives were evaluated as adsorbents. The adsorption activity for heavy metals such as Cu(II) and Cr(VI) by crosslinked amino starch was studied in terms of adsorption amount, kinetics and isotherm; and adsorbent reuse were also studied. Adsorption processes for Cu(II) and Cr(VI) on crosslinked amino starch fit a Langmuir isotherm, and adsorption for Cu(II) and Cr(VI) from aqueous solution was endothermic reactions. Crosslinked amino starch was very effective for the adsorption of Cu(II) and Cr(VI), and efficient in capacity, recycled.","['Adsorption', 'Amines', 'Chromium', 'Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Copper', 'Ethylenediamines', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Methods', 'Starch', 'Thermodynamics']",20605326,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['D02.092'], ['D01.268.556.175', 'D01.268.956.124', 'D01.552.544.175'], ['J01.256', 'N06.230.080'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['D02.092.782.258.368'], ['D01.268.556', 'D01.552.544'], ['E05.581'], ['D05.750.078.562.855', 'D09.301.915', 'D09.698.365.855'], ['G01.906']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
40142,Interactions between the oocyte and cumulus cells in the ovary of the B6.Y(TIR) sex-reversed female mouse.,"The XY (B6.Y(TIR)) sex-reversed female mouse is infertile, primarily because of the early death of its embryos. We have previously determined that the XY oocyte itself, not the surrounding somatic cells, is responsible for its failure in postfertilization development. In the present study, we assessed the ability of the XY oocyte to regulate granulosa cell differentiation and functions. Oocyte-cumulus complexes (OCC) were isolated from antral follicles and were cultured in the presence of FSH and testosterone. Microsurgical removal of oocytes prevented cumulus cell expansion and suppressed estradiol production while it promoted progesterone production. Coculture with denuded oocytes from either XX or XY ovaries restored cumulus expansion and the endocrine profile observed in intact OCC. Morphology of oocytes and OCC in the preantral and antral follicles in situ as well as after isolation was compared for XX and XY ovaries. The average area of XY oocytes was smaller by 20% only at the preantral stage, whereas the zona pellucida layer was thinner by 20% at all stages. Furthermore, the XY oocyte was found to be attached to fewer cumulus cells (60% of XX control) in antral follicles and isolated OCC. In conclusion, the XY oocyte develops the normal ability of regulating granulosa cell differentiation despite its inferiority with respect to some morphometric parameters when compared to the XX oocyte.","['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chimera', 'Disorders of Sex Development', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Granulosa Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Oocytes', 'Ovary', 'Progesterone', 'Sex Differentiation', 'Y Chromosome']",9283002,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.085'], ['G04.152'], ['B05.200'], ['C12.706.316', 'C13.351.875.253', 'C16.131.939.316', 'C19.391.119'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['G05.380'], ['A05.360.319.114.630.535.200', 'A06.300.312.497.535.300', 'A11.382.812', 'A11.436.329'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['A05.360.490.690.680', 'A11.497.497.600'], ['A05.360.319.114.630', 'A05.360.576.497', 'A06.300.312.497'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829', 'D06.472.334.734.623', 'D06.472.334.851.687.750'], ['G07.345.500.325.377.843', 'G07.345.750.500', 'G08.686.841.500'], ['A11.284.187.865.983', 'G05.360.162.865.983']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33932,"DTS-108, a novel peptidic prodrug of SN38: in vivo efficacy and toxicokinetic studies.","PURPOSE: Irinotecan is a prodrug converted to the active cytotoxic molecule SN38 predominantly by the action of liver carboxylesterases. The efficacy of irinotecan is limited by this hepatic activation that results in a low conversion rate, high interpatient variability, and dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel peptidic prodrug of SN38 (DTS-108) developed to bypass this hepatic activation and thus reduce the gastrointestinal toxicity and interpatient variability compared with irinotecan.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: SN38 was conjugated to a cationic peptide (Vectocell) via an esterase cleavable linker. The preclinical development plan consisted of toxicity and efficacy evaluation in a number of different models and species.RESULTS: The conjugate (DTS-108) is highly soluble, with a human plasma half-life of 400 minutes in vitro. Studies in the dog showed that DTS-108 liberates significantly higher levels of free SN38 than irinotecan without causing gastrointestinal toxicity. In addition, the ratio of the inactive SN38-glucuronide metabolite compared with the active SN38 metabolite is significantly lower following DTS-108 administration, compared with irinotecan, which is consistent with reduced hepatic metabolism. In vivo efficacy studies showed that DTS-108 has improved activity compared with irinotecan. A significant dose-dependent antitumoral efficacy was observed in all models tested and DTS-108 showed synergistic effects in combination with other clinically relevant therapeutic agents.CONCLUSIONS: DTS-108 is able to deliver significantly higher levels of SN38 than irinotecan, without the associated toxicity of irinotecan, resulting in an increased therapeutic window for DTS-108 in preclinical models. These encouraging data merit further preclinical and clinical investigation.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Camptothecin', 'Cations', 'Dogs', 'Drug Carriers', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Peptides', 'Prodrugs', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",18381956,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248.179'], ['D03.132.151'], ['D01.248.497.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['D26.255.260', 'E02.319.300.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.132.151.425'], ['C04.619', 'E05.598.500.496'], ['D12.644'], ['D26.675'], ['E05.337.550.200.900', 'E05.624.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
10754,A novel ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase from the hydrogen-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacterium Hydrogenobacter thermophilus TK-6.,"Glutamate synthases are classified according to their specificities for electron donors. Ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthases had been found only in plants and cyanobacteria, whereas many bacteria have NADPH-dependent glutamate synthases. In this study, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus, a hydrogen-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacterium, was shown to possess a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase like those of phototrophs. This is the first observation, to our knowledge, of a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase in a nonphotosynthetic organism. The purified enzyme from H. thermophilus was shown to be a monomer of a 168-kDa polypeptide homologous to ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthases from phototrophs. In contrast to known ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthases, the H. thermophilus glutamate synthase exhibited glutaminase activity. Furthermore, this glutamate synthase did not react with a plant-type ferredoxin (Fd3 from this bacterium) containing a [2Fe-2S] cluster but did react with bacterial ferredoxins (Fd1 and Fd2 from this bacterium) containing [4Fe-4S] clusters. Interestingly, the H. thermophilus glutamate synthase was activated by some of the organic acids in the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, the central carbon metabolic pathway of this organism. This type of activation has not been reported for any other glutamate synthases, and this property may enable the control of nitrogen assimilation by carbon metabolism.","['Bacteria', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'DNA Primers', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Ferredoxins', 'Glutamate Synthase', 'Hydrogen', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Spectrophotometry']",17237175,"[['B03'], ['D12.776.097'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['E05.196.867.519.274'], ['D12.776.097.350', 'D12.776.157.427.374.375.275', 'D12.776.556.579.374.375.275', 'D12.776.765.319'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.470', 'D08.811.913.477.700.470'], ['D01.268.406', 'D01.362.340'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['D12.776.828'], ['E05.196.712.726', 'E05.196.867.826']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
9275,Lenvatinib versus sorafenib in first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial.,"BACKGROUND: In a phase 2 trial, lenvatinib, an inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1-3, FGF receptors 1-4, PDGF receptor á, RET, and KIT, showed activity in hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to compare overall survival in patients treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.METHODS: This was an open-label, phase 3, multicentre, non-inferiority trial that recruited patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, who had not received treatment for advanced disease, at 154 sites in 20 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific, European, and North American regions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice-web response system-with region; macroscopic portal vein invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; and bodyweight as stratification factors-to receive oral lenvatinib (12 mg/day for bodyweight ?60 kg or 8 mg/day for bodyweight <60 kg) or sorafenib 400 mg twice-daily in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured from the date of randomisation until the date of death from any cause. The efficacy analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle, and only patients who received treatment were included in the safety analysis. The non-inferiority margin was set at 1·08. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01761266.FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2013 and July 30, 2015, 1492 patients were recruited. 954 eligible patients were randomly assigned to lenvatinib (n=478) or sorafenib (n=476). Median survival time for lenvatinib of 13·6 months (95% CI 12·1-14·9) was non-inferior to sorafenib (12·3 months, 10·4-13·9; hazard ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·06), meeting criteria for non-inferiority. The most common any-grade adverse events were hypertension (201 [42%]), diarrhoea (184 [39%]), decreased appetite (162 [34%]), and decreased weight (147 [31%]) for lenvatinib, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (249 [52%]), diarrhoea (220 [46%]), hypertension (144 [30%]), and decreased appetite (127 [27%]) for sorafenib.INTERPRETATION: Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The safety and tolerability profiles of lenvatinib were consistent with those previously observed.FUNDING: Eisai Inc.","['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Niacinamide', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Quinolines', 'Sorafenib', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",29433850,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.066.515.530', 'D03.383.725.547.530'], ['D02.065.950.681', 'D02.455.426.559.389.703'], ['D03.633.100.810'], ['D02.065.950.681.757', 'D02.455.426.559.389.703.757', 'D03.066.515.530.750', 'D03.383.725.547.530.750'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
38914,Lower-body determinants of running economy in male and female distance runners.,"A variety of training approaches have been shown to improve running economy in well-trained athletes. However, there is a paucity of data exploring lower-body determinants that may affect running economy and account for differences that may exist between genders. Sixty-three male and female distance runners were assessed in the laboratory for a range of metabolic, biomechanical, and neuromuscular measures potentially related to running economy (ml·kg(-1)·min(-1)) at a range of running speeds. At all common test velocities, women were more economical than men (effect size [ES] = 0.40); however, when compared in terms of relative intensity, men had better running economy (ES = 2.41). Leg stiffness (r = -0.80) and moment arm length (r = 0.90) were large-extremely largely correlated with running economy and each other (r = -0.82). Correlations between running economy and kinetic measures (peak force, peak power, and time to peak force) for both genders were unclear. The relationship in stride rate (r = -0.27 to -0.31) was in the opposite direction to that of stride length (r = 0.32-0.49), and the relationship in contact time (r = -0.21 to -0.54) was opposite of that of flight time (r = 0.06-0.74). Although both leg stiffness and moment arm length are highly related to running economy, it seems that no single lower-body measure can completely explain differences in running economy between individuals or genders. Running economy is therefore likely determined from the sum of influences from multiple lower-body attributes.","['Achilles Tendon', 'Adolescent', 'Arm', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Gait', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leg', 'Male', 'Movement', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Running', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",24126900,"[['A02.880.176'], ['M01.060.057'], ['A01.378.800.075'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['E01.370.600.250', 'G11.427.410.568.900.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A01.378.610.500'], ['G07.568', 'G11.427.410'], ['G03.680'], ['G11.427.410.568.610', 'G11.427.410.698.277.750', 'I03.350.750', 'I03.450.642.845.610'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
45558,Common variation at 6q16 within HACE1 and LIN28B influences susceptibility to neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for approximately 10% of all pediatric oncology deaths. Here, we report a genome-wide association study of 2,817 neuroblastoma cases and 7,473 controls. We identified two new associations at 6q16, the first within HACE1 (rs4336470; combined P=2.7?10(-11); odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.35) and the second within LIN28B (rs17065417; combined P=1.2?10(-8); odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.23-1.54). Expression of LIN28B and let-7 miRNA correlated with rs17065417 genotype in neuroblastoma cell lines, and we observed significant growth inhibition upon depletion of LIN28B, specifically in neuroblastoma cells that were homozygous for the risk allele. Low HACE1 and high LIN28B expression in diagnostic primary neuroblastomas were associated with worse overall survival (P=0.008 and 0.014, respectively). Taken together, these data show that common variants in HACE1 and LIN28B influence neuroblastoma susceptibility and indicate that both genes likely have a role in disease progression.","['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcriptome', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",22941191,"[['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.325.330', 'G05.360.162.520.300.325.330'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.330'], ['E05.393.335.500'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['E05.318.370.392', 'E05.318.416.249', 'E05.393.385.500', 'E05.393.522.500', 'E05.393.760.640.500', 'N06.850.520.445.392', 'N06.850.520.470.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['G05.348.500'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.590.650.550', 'C04.557.470.670.590.650.550', 'C04.557.580.625.600.590.650.550'], ['E05.393.661.640', 'E05.393.760.640', 'E05.588.570.660', 'E05.601.640'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['D12.776.157.725', 'D12.776.664.962'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['G02.111.873.750', 'G05.297.700.750', 'G05.360.920'], ['D08.811.464.938.750']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
11523,"Victimization, Suicidal Ideation, and Alcohol Use From Age 13 to 15 Years: Support for the Self-Medication Model.","PURPOSE: Recent years have seen increased coverage of adolescent victimization and suicide. Both adolescent peer victimization and substance use have been associated with suicidal ideation, with evidence suggesting that all three factors are interrelated. There are at least four models which can explain the associations between these factors (i.e., self-medication, secondary mental disorder, bidirectional, and common factor). However, none of them is being empirically supported as the dominant model because few longitudinal studies have explored the association between these factors.METHODS: The present study compared longitudinal paths of all four models simultaneously using a cross-lagged model. This was done using self-reported measures of peer victimization, suicidal ideation, and alcohol use at age 13, 14, and 15 years in a longitudinal sample of 238 adolescents.RESULTS: All three variables were moderately stable across time. Significant cross-lagged associations were found, showing that frequent peer victimization at age 13 years was associated with higher odds of having suicidal ideation at age 14 years (odds ratio, 1.82; p < .05). In turn, presence of suicidal ideation at age 14 years was significantly associated with higher alcohol use frequency at age 15 years (â = .13; p < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Results support previous literature suggesting that peer victimization predates alcohol use and extends it by showing clear directionality between suicidal ideation and alcohol use over 1 year, supporting the self-medication model. Clarifying the empirical basis of these underlying models could allow for earlier prevention strategies, by targeting the risk factor that appears the earliest in the model.","['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Bullying', 'Crime Victims', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Models, Psychological', 'Peer Group', 'Quebec', 'Self Medication', 'Self Report', 'Suicidal Ideation']",27914973,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.145.022'], ['F01.145.317.269'], ['F01.145.126.125.550', 'F01.145.813.213.500', 'I01.880.735.070'], ['M01.135'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['E05.599.695'], ['F01.829.316.483'], ['Z01.107.567.176.791'], ['E02.319.900', 'E02.900.900'], ['E05.318.308.980.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.500'], ['F01.145.126.980.875.149', 'I01.880.735.856.149']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
27253,Study of human epithelial cell detachment and damage: development of a model.,"Detachment of epithelial structures from underlying basement membrane (BM) represents an important component of a number of human disease processes e.g. airway and alveolar diseases, gastrointestinal ulceration, and retinal diseases. This study describes a method of evaluating human epithelial cell detachment from BM that is simple, rapid, inexpensive, quantifiable and which, because it utilizes BM rather than tissue culture plastic, more closely mimics the in vivo situation than other methods. In this model human amnionic epithelial cells attached to their underlying BM are isolated from fresh placentae and mounted in a multi-well chemotaxis assembly. These membranes can be studied with the epithelial cell monolayer intact. Protease-induced detachment of the epithelial cells from the underlying BM was readily quantifiable using light microscopy and spectroscopy. Following removal of the native amnionic epithelial cells, immunoperoxidase staining for the BM attachment proteins laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen demonstrated that these molecules remain intact. The BM could also be used as an attachment surface to reconstitute other epithelial cell monolayers. Cultured human amnionic cells and human respiratory epithelial cells were both able to attach to the denuded BM in the absence of serum (% attachment = 85 +/- 15% and 92 +/- 8% respectively, P = 0.8). Natural BM was a better substrate for epithelial cell attachment than tissue culture plastic in that, in the absence of serum, cultured epithelial cell attachment to tissue culture plastic was 20 +/- 4% of the value for BM (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, cells attached to plastic adhered less effectively than to BM in that trypsin concentrations required to induce 50% cell detachment were 0.72 +/- 0.4 for plastic and 62 +/- 13 BAEE U/ml for BM (P less than 0.001). In view of the complex protein interactions known to be involved in the anchorage of human epithelial cells to BM, it is likely this model will be a useful tool for evaluating the mechanisms underlying human epithelial cell attachment and detachment in a variety of normal and disease situations.","['Amnion', 'Basement Membrane', 'Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen', 'Epithelial Attachment', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Extraembryonic Membranes', 'Fibronectins', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Laminin', 'Models, Biological', 'Periodontium', 'Spectrophotometry']",2696726,"[['A10.615.284.277', 'A16.254.750.277'], ['A10.272.220', 'A10.615.179'], ['E01.370.225.500.195', 'E05.200.500.195', 'E05.242.195', 'G04.140'], ['A11.251'], ['D05.750.078.280', 'D12.776.860.300.250'], ['A14.549.167.646.374'], ['A11.436'], ['A10.272'], ['A10.615.284', 'A16.254.750'], ['D12.776.377.715.390', 'D12.776.395.550.350', 'D12.776.543.550.350', 'D12.776.860.300.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.350', 'E05.478.583.400', 'E05.601.470.350'], ['D12.776.395.550.530', 'D12.776.543.550.500', 'D12.776.860.300.675'], ['E05.599.395'], ['A14.549.167.646'], ['E05.196.712.726', 'E05.196.867.826']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33453,Mechanism of action of cholera toxin and the mobile receptor theory of hormone receptor-adenylate cyclase interactions.,"Rat liver membrane adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) that has been stimulated more than 10-fold by cholera toxin (choleragen) has a 3-fold greater sensitivity to stimulation by glucagon. Choleragen similarly increases the sensitivity of cyclase to other peptide (ACTH, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) and nonpeptide (catecholamines) hormones in this and other tissues. The rate of 125I-labeled glucagon-membrane dissociation is decreased about 2-fold in toxin-treated liver membranes. Toxin-activated cyclase activity of fat cell membranes is retained upon solubilization with Lubrol PX. Provided 125I-labeled choleragen is first incubated with cells under conditions resulting in enzyme activation, the solubilized cyclase activity migrates with a component of 125I-labeled choleragen on gel filtration chromatography. Agarose derivatives containing the ""active"" subunit (molecular weight 36,000) of the toxin can specifically adsorb solubilized adenylate cyclase. Toxin-stimulated cyclase can be immunoprecipitated with antitoxin or anti-""active"" subunit antibodies. There is a large excess of membrane receptors (ganglioside GM1) which, with the use of choleragenoid, can be shown to be functionally equivalent with respect to cyclase activation. Choleragenoid, an inactive competitive antagonist of toxin binding, can occupy and block a large proportion of toxin receptors without affecting toxin activity. A scheme of toxin action is proposed that involves lateral membrane diffusion of the initially inactive toxin-receptor complex with subsequent direct interaction with and modulation of adenylate cyclase. The basic features of this scheme may be pertinent to the mechanisms by which hormone receptors normally modulate adenylate cyclase.","['Adenylyl Cyclases', 'Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gangliosides', 'Glucagon', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Liver', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Toxins, Biological', 'Vibrio cholerae']",164020,"[['D08.811.520.650.200', 'D12.644.360.050', 'D12.776.476.050'], ['A10.165.114'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.284.149'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D09.400.410.420.025.475', 'D10.390.470.025.475', 'D10.570.877.360.025.475'], ['D06.472.699.587.730.500', 'D12.644.548.586.730.500'], ['D01.268.380.400.500.496', 'D01.496.448.496', 'D01.496.749.474'], ['A03.620'], ['E05.599.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['D23.946'], ['B03.440.450.900.859.225', 'B03.660.250.830.830.100']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
19840,Influence of CPITN partial recordings on estimates of prevalence and severity of various periodontal conditions in adults.,"This study compares the results of a full mouth examination with the results of examining only the CPITN selection of 10 index teeth 17/16, 11, 26/27, 47/46, 31 and 36/37 for estimates of prevalence and severity of the conditions assessed with the CPITN, i.e. gingival bleeding, dental calculus, pockets 4-5 mm deep and pockets 6+ mm deep. The mean number of sextants recorded with bleeding or with calculus was generally overestimated when examinations were based on the CPITN selection of index teeth, whereas the mean number of sextants with pockets, whether moderate or deep, were generally underestimated. Similarly, the prevalence of pockets, whether moderate or deep, was underestimated in virtually all age groups while the prevalence of calculus was overestimated in all age groups and the prevalence of bleeding was overestimated among persons below 30 yr of age. We conclude that the partial recording approach of the CPITN methodology is reasonably well suited for identifying persons who are relatively healthy according to the hierarchy of the CPITN parameters. There is, however, a considerable risk that persons presenting with the more severe conditions, i.e. pockets, will be overlooked if only partial recordings are performed.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Dental Calculus', 'Gingival Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Kenya', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Periodontal Index', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility of Results']",8306612,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C07.793.208.250', 'C23.300.175.350'], ['C07.465.625.446', 'C07.465.714.258.250', 'C23.550.414.922.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.058.290.120.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['C07.465.714'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.300.725', 'E06.208.720', 'E06.721.658', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.300.690', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.300.725', 'N06.890.160.215'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Racemic 6 and 11 did not substitute in (S)-amphetamine-trained rats. All of the test compounds were potent inhibitors of [3H]-5-HT uptake into synaptosomes in vitro, with the S enantiomer of 6 being most active. Rat brain monoamine levels were unaltered 1 week following a single high dose (10 or 20 mg/kg, sc) of 6 or 11, or two weeks following a subacute dosing regimen (20 mg/kg, sc, twice a day for 4 days). In addition, radioligand-binding parameters in rat brain homogenate with the 5-HT uptake inhibitor [3H]paroxetine were unchanged after subacute dosing with either racemic 6 or 11.

43484,Bilateral childhood visual impairment: child and parent concerns.,"PURPOSE: To identify specific health-related quality of life and visual function concerns affecting children with bilateral visual impairment as expressed by children or one of their parents (proxy) and concerns affecting the parents themselves.METHODS: A total of 37 children <16 years of age with visual impairment (visual acuity worse than 20/70 in the better eye) and one parent for each child were prospectively enrolled. Semistructured individual interviews were performed with children 5-15 years of age (n = 16) and with one parent for each child (ages 0-15 years, N = 37). Interview transcripts were analyzed using NVivo software. Categories of concern were identified from both child and parent interviews, from which broad themes were identified. The frequencies of the themes and specific categories of concerns were calculated.RESULTS: Regarding the child's experience, categories of concern were grouped into 6 themes: visual function (expressed by 13 of 16 children [81%] and 33 of 37 parents [89%]), treatment (63% and 54%), emotions (50% and 68%), social (50% and 70%), physical discomfort (50% and 22%), and worry (38% and 8%).

Mental retardation represents the highest proportion of subjects followed by Down's syndrome and then Autism Male subjects were found to consume higher nutrients than females at all ages except age under seven years. The intake of both gender was less than the recommended for energy, calcium, vitamin A, niacin and zinc. While the intake of protein and vitamin C was more than the RDA Iron intake was below the recommended for females at all ages and within the acceptable level for male. The results also showed that there is a relationship between nutrient intake and disability type. Down syndrome children were found to consume more nutrients than mentally retarded and autistic subjects.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Disabled Children', 'Egypt', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional Status', 'Urban Population']",16918148,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.150.200'], ['Z01.058.266.317'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.585', 'N05.715.360.300.560', 'N06.850.505.557', 'N06.850.520.308.585'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['N01.600.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
37873,Non-heparin hemodialysis with oral administration of newly developed antiplatelet agent.,"Non-heparin hemodialysis (HD) was successfully done in anuric dogs with the oral administration of a newly developed antiplatelet agent, 4-cyano-5,5-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-pentenoic acid, (E5510, Eisai Pharmaceutical Co., Japan). In the current study, the antithrombotic effect of E5510 during HD was investigated. Eleven mongrel dogs with bilateral ureteral ligation were given 0.1 mg/kg of E5510 orally 1 hr before undergoing 4 hr HD using hollow fiber dialyzers, (PMMA 5, regenerated cellulose 6) without heparin and under general anesthesia. Blood samples were taken before the administration of E5510 and before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after starting HD; blood counts, hematocrits, blood chemistries, and plasma thromboxane levels (TxB2) were examined. Platelet aggregation, activated clotting times (ACT), and activated partial thrombin times (APTT) were also measured, and sequential plasma E5510 concentrations were determined. In 10 of 11 anuric dogs, non-heparin HD was successfully done with minimal clotting in the dialyzer and drip chambers. The maximum aggregation rate was depressed to less than 20% of the initial value throughout HD. Plasma TxB2 concentration was depressed, and ACT and APTT were mildly, but not significantly prolonged. Neither hemorrhagic complications nor other side effects of E5510 were observed.","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated', 'Heparin', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Kidneys, Artificial', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors', 'Renal Dialysis']",2252660,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['D10.251.355.325'], ['D09.698.373.400'], ['C12.777.419.780.750.500', 'C13.351.968.419.780.750.500'], ['E07.858.082.585'], ['D27.505.954.502.780'], ['E02.870.300', 'E02.912.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3762,Serum microRNA-21 predicted treatment outcome and survival in HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of ser-miRNAs at different periods during treatment and analyze their relationship with therapeutic response and prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab (NCCT).METHODS: Venous blood was drawn from patients at different periods during NCCT. The expression of ser-miRNAs was assessed by qRT-PCR and their relation to treatment response and survival was analyzed.RESULTS: The results showed the expression of miR-10b, -21, -34a, -125b, -145, -155, and -373 in patients before the start of treatment was significantly higher, ser-miR-210 was lower, and ser-miR-122 was comparable to the levels in healthy controls. Changes in ser-miR-21 levels during NCCT were significantly correlated to clinical response and survival and, however, were not associated with pathology response. The expression levels of ser-miR-21 were decreased from the start of NCCT to the end of the second cycle and from the start to the end of NCCT in clinical responders; however, there was no significant difference in non-responders. The patients with decreased ser-miR-21 expression from the start to the end of the second cycle and from the start to the end of NCCT had better overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than those with elevated ser-miR-21 expression.CONCLUSION: These results showed that changes in ser-miR-21 levels were significantly related to NCCT clinical response and prognosis. Ser-miR-21 may serve as a non-invasive biomarker to predict NCCT response in HER2-positive breast cancer.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Survival Rate', 'Trastuzumab', 'Treatment Outcome']",31482230,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.248.384'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D13.150.650.319', 'D13.444.735.150.319', 'D13.444.735.790.552.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.186.450'], ['E01.789'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074.400', 'D12.776.624.664.700.642', 'D23.050.301.500.600.700', 'D23.050.705.552.600.550', 'D23.101.140.642'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.060.875', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.060.875', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.200.875'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
11534,Gait pattern differences in children with unilateral cerebral palsy.,"Children with cerebral palsy (CP) often have atypical body posture patterns and abnormal gait patterns resulting from functional strategies to compensate for primary anomalies that are directly attributable to damage to the central nervous system. Our previous study revealed two different postural patterns in children with unilateral CP: (1) a pattern with overloading of the affected body side and (2) a pattern with under-loading of the affected side. The purpose of present study was to test whether different gait patterns dependent on weight distribution between the affected and unaffected body sides could be detected in these children. The study included 45 outpatients with unilateral CP and 51 children with mild scoliosis (reference group). The examination consisted of two inter-related parts: paedobarographic measurements of the body mass distribution between the body sides and three-dimensional instrumented gait analysis. Using cluster analysis based on the Gillette Gait Index (GGI) values, three gait patterns were described: a scoliotic gait pattern and two hemiplegic gait patterns, corresponding to overloading/under-loading of the hemi-side, which are the pro-gravitational gait pattern (PGP) and the anti-gravitational gait pattern (AGP), respectively. The results of this study showed that subjects with AGP presented a higher degree of deviation from the normal gait than children with PGP. This proof that there are differences in the GGI between the AGP and PGP could be a starting point to identify kinematic differences between these gaits in a follow-up study.","['Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Hemiplegia', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Scoliosis', 'Weight-Bearing']",24946266,"[['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C10.228.140.140.254'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['C10.597.404', 'C23.888.592.413'], ['C10.597.622.295', 'C23.888.592.636.312'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C05.116.900.800.875'], ['G01.374.965']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
20131,Comparison of the 18-item and 6-item Lubben Social Network Scales with community-dwelling older adults in Mongolia.,"This study compares the psychometric properties of two versions of the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-18 and LSNS-6) with community dwelling older adults in Mongolia. We recruited 650 older adult in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar and the country's four rural regions. We used the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), the Short Form 12 (SF-12) physical and mental health functioning measures, and a multi-dimensional scale of social isolation for confirmatory factor analyses of the LSNS-18 and the LSNS-6. Both versions demonstrated excellent internal consistency and intraclass correlation and both correlated in expected directions with other study measures. Only the LSNS-6 provided a good fit to the data. The LSNS-6 is a viable instrument for assessing the social networks of older adults in Mongolia. The study adds to the sparse literature on measuring social and behavioral determinants of health in resource-constrained settings characterized by aging populations and high internal migration rates.","['Aged', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Humans', 'Independent Living', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Mongolia', 'Social Isolation', 'Social Networking']",30998800,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.308.225', 'I01.240.425.350', 'N01.224.425.350', 'N05.715.360.300.360', 'N06.850.505.400.425.350', 'N06.850.520.308.225'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I03.050.500', 'N01.224.791.550', 'N06.850.505.400.800.550'], ['F02.418', 'N01.400.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.252.474.651'], ['F01.145.813.781', 'I01.880.853.748'], ['L01.143.910']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
35773,The myosin motor in muscle generates a smaller and slower working stroke at higher load.,"Muscle contraction is driven by the motor protein myosin II, which binds transiently to an actin filament, generates a unitary filament displacement or 'working stroke', then detaches and repeats the cycle. The stroke size has been measured previously using isolated myosin II molecules at low load, with rather variable results, but not at the higher loads that the motor works against during muscle contraction. Here we used a novel X-ray-interference technique to measure the working stroke of myosin II at constant load in an intact muscle cell, preserving the native structure and function of the motor. We show that the stroke is smaller and slower at higher load. The stroke size at low load is likely to be set by a structural limit; at higher loads, the motor detaches from actin before reaching this limit. The load dependence of the myosin II stroke is the primary molecular determinant of the mechanical performance and efficiency of skeletal muscle.","['Animals', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Molecular Motor Proteins', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Myosin Type II', 'Ranidae', 'X-Rays']",15058307,"[['B01.050'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['G11.427.494.472'], ['D05.500.500', 'D08.811.277.040.025.193'], ['A10.690.552.500.500', 'A11.620.249'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['D05.750.078.730.475.475', 'D08.811.277.040.025.193.750.750', 'D12.776.210.500.600.470', 'D12.776.220.525.475.475'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.708'], ['G01.358.500.505.970', 'G01.750.250.970', 'G01.750.750.918']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
20805,Self-esteem and symptoms of depression in children with seizures: relationships with neuropsychological functioning and family variables over time.,"PURPOSE: To test over time the relationships of neuropsychological functioning to mental health in children following a first recognized seizure and, of primary importance, to determine if the strength of these relationships differs based on risk and protective factors.METHODS: In a larger prospective study, 135 children with a first seizure (ages 8-14 years) and 73 healthy sibling controls completed neuropsychological testing at baseline and 36 months. Structured telephone interviews were used to obtain data from children on mental health and family environment; major caregiving parents provided data on demographic and family variables. Data analyses included correlation coefficients and linear regression models.RESULTS: Children with seizures showed an overall trend for improvement in mental health. More children with seizures than siblings had declines in processing speed. Declines in neuropsychological functioning were correlated with worse mental health. With regard to risk and protective factors, higher parent education protected against decline in self-esteem related to decline in processing speed. Better family functioning and greater parental support protected against decline in self-esteem related to decrease in verbal memory and learning. Older child age protected against increase in depressive symptoms related to decline in processing speed.DISCUSSION: Seizure onset had a negative impact on mental health in children with declines in cognitive functioning except for older children and those with more family resources. Children should be assessed for declines in processing speed and, if found, those subgroups of children with less educated or more anxious parents and those in less supportive families should be targeted for interventions.","['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Depression', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Parents', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Seizures', 'Self Concept']",20412284,"[['M01.060.057'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['N05.715.350.075.100', 'N06.850.490.250.100'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['E05.318.740.400', 'N05.715.360.750.350', 'N06.850.520.830.400'], ['F01.829.263', 'I01.880.853.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.420', 'L01.399.250.520', 'N05.715.360.300.400', 'N06.850.520.308.420'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['F04.711.513'], ['F01.829.263.500.320', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340', 'M01.620'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['C10.597.742', 'C23.888.592.742'], ['F01.752.747.792']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0

Each strain of M. gallisepticum typed by PFGE and RAPD methods was genetically quite unique and RAPD and PFGE fingerprinting enabled strain characterization. Relationships between the M. gallisepticum and M. imitans strains were established and dendrograms were drawn from PFGE and RAPD patterns. PFGE group A and RAPD group D were significantly associated with M. imitans strains (P < 0.05). Three M. imitans strains shared the same PFGE and RAPD patterns. The two M. gallisepticum vaccine strains had singular PFGE and RAPD patterns. Thus, PFGE and RAPD can be used to investigate disease outbreaks in vaccinated flocks or for epidemiological tracking. For M. gallisepticum, the RAPD and PFGE discriminatory powers were superior to 0.95 and the in vitro, in ovo and in vivo reproducibility of RAPD and PFGE was 100%. The RAPD drawback was the inconsistent band intensity complicating the interpretation of patterns, while the PFGE limit was its low typeability (86%). Thus, these two molecular typing methods seemed complementary for M. gallisepticum epidemiological studies.","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Genetic Variation', 'Mycoplasma', 'Mycoplasma Infections', 'Poultry Diseases', 'Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Turkeys']",11765805,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['E05.196.401.220', 'E05.301.300.220'], ['G05.365'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.553'], ['C01.150.252.400.610.610'], ['C22.131.728'], ['E05.393.620.500.687', 'E05.601.700'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.800', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

23185,MOV10 interacts with Enterovirus 71 genomic 5'UTR and modulates viral replication.,"As a cytoplasmic parasite, RNA virus develops sophisticated mechanisms to counter host defense and utilize host proteins to facilitate its replication. Here we found Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10), a highly conserved cellular protein belonging to SF1 helicase family, played critical roles in EV71 infection. Silencing cellular MOV10 could restrict EV71 replication, while over-expressing MOV10 resulted in increased viral replication at low dosage and repressed viral replication at high dosage. Further investigation showed that MOV10 exhibited dual functions in EV71 regulation, its C-terminus positively regulated viral replication by binding to EV71 cloverleaf-like structure and the internal ribosome entry site while the N-terminus showed a potential antiviral activity when individually overexpressed. In addition, RNA-dependent interaction between MOV10 and HuR as well as the co-localization of MOV10 and processing bodies were also observed post infection. Taken together, our data indicate a crucial role of MOV10 in EV71 infection for the first time, providing new insights for its roles in EV71 infection.","[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'ELAV-Like Protein 1', 'Enterovirus A, Human', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genome, Viral', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Internal Ribosome Entry Sites', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Helicases', 'RNA, Viral', 'Virus Replication']",27666477,"[['D13.444.735.544.875.885', 'D13.444.735.790.878.885', 'G05.360.340.024.220.880.885', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.910.885'], ['D12.776.157.725.813.500.250', 'D12.776.664.962.813.500.250'], ['B04.820.578.750.284.180'], ['G05.308.203.374'], ['G05.360.340.358.840'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D13.444.735.790.878.942.250', 'G02.111.570.080.689.687.093', 'G05.360.080.689.687.093'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.750', 'G02.111.570.820.709.610.500'], ['D13.444.735'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.735.720'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['G06.920.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
16907,Cognitive fMRI and neuropsychological assessment in patients with secondarily generalized seizures.,"OBJECTIVES: Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent comorbid disorder in epilepsy which has been associated with high seizure frequency. We examined the effect of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (SGTCS) on cognitive dysfunction using neuropsychological assessment and fMRI.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with localization-related epilepsy of varying etiologies and SGTCS underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment. Functional MRI was performed probing the frontal and temporal lobes with two paradigms aimed at investigating speed of mental processing and working memory.RESULTS: A high number of total lifetime SGTCS was associated with lower intelligence scores. Moreover, a trend towards cognitive decline related to the number of SGTCS was observed. A relatively increased prefrontal activation related to the number of SGTCS was demonstrated, plus a trend towards a decreased activation in the frontotemporal areas.CONCLUSION: High numbers of SGTCS are associated with a drop in intelligence scores and altered prefrontal brain activation. A shift from frontotemporal to prefrontal activation seems to have occurred, suggesting that a functional reorganization of working memory is induced by a high number of SGTCS. It remains uncertain if this reorganization reflects a compensation mechanism, or the underlying pathological processes of cognitive dysfunction.","['Adult', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Linear Models', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Memory, Short-Term', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Problem Solving', 'Seizures', 'Temporal Lobe']",18339478,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['F03.615.250'], ['C10.228.140.490.375.290'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.711.141.493'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['F02.463.425.540.407'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.711.513'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270.700'], ['F02.463.425.725', 'F02.463.785.810'], ['C10.597.742', 'C23.888.592.742'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.863']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

5997,Pentachlorophenol treatment in vivo elevates point mutation rate in zebrafish p53 gene.,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP), a probable human carcinogen, has been heavily used as an aseptic and a biocide throughout the world, and is widely present in the environment. Recent survey in Germany revealed that the average PCP amount in the urine of general German populations was 1.04 microg/L while the peak concentration could reach up to 19.1 microg/L. PCP was reported to cause DNA damage, but whether it can be involved in inducing point mutations in genome is unknown. To determine the genotoxicity of PCP on vertebrate, we first performed acute toxicity test on zebrafish for the effect of PCP exposure. The LC50 values of zebrafish exposed to PCP at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h were determined to be 0.196, 0.130, 0.130 and 0.130 mg/L, respectively. We then treated zebrafish with PCP for 10 days at 0 (control), 0.5, 5 and 50 microg/L, respectively, to determine whether PCP could be involved in inducing point mutations. Employing denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and DNA sequencing, we demonstrated that exposure of PCP to zebrafish at a concentration as low as 5 microg/L for 10 days elevates point mutation rate in p53 gene in liver cells. This is the first direct evidence revealing that PCP can elevate point mutation rate in the vertebrate genomes. The result implies PCP might be involved in carcinogenesis by elevating point mutation rate in the somatic genomes.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fish Proteins', 'Insecticides', 'Liver', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pentachlorophenol', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute', 'Transition Temperature', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Zebrafish']",16904934,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D13.444.308'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D12.776.325'], ['D27.720.031.700.491', 'D27.888.723.491'], ['A03.620'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.190.633'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['E05.940.790'], ['G01.906.595.850'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.200.244.828']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
30979,Sedative effect of oral diazepam and chloral hydrate in the dental treatment of children.,"PURPOSE: The purpose was to evaluate two sedation protocols during dental sessions in anxious children.MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a randomized and double-blind study, with each individual being his/her own control within each protocol. Furthermore, the two protocols were compared. Twenty children (36 to 84 months old) who exhibited ""definitely negative"" behavior according to the Frankl scale were assigned to receive oral chloral hydrate (40 mg/kg) (Group I) or Diazepam (5 mg) (Group II). Behavior during local anesthesia, application of rubber dam, cavity preparation, restorative procedures was evaluated, considering the degree of sleep, body movement, crying and overall behavior. Vital signs were assessed at three different times. The Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Exact Fisher's and Spearman correlation tests were used to analyze the data.RESULTS: Group I presented higher scores for sleep during the CH session than placebo session during rubber dam application (P = 0.0431) and restoration (P = 0.0431). In Group II there was no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between sessions and groups in the evaluation of body movement, crying and vital signs. Overall behavior in the placebo session was better than in the CH session during local anesthesia, but there was no difference between the two drug regimens. There was influence of age during anesthesia and cavity preparation in Group I and during rubber dam application in Group II. It was concluded that oral diazepam and chloral hydrate had no influence on the behavior management for dental treatment with the studied sample.","['Administration, Oral', 'Age Factors', 'Anesthesia, Dental', 'Anesthesia, Local', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chloral Hydrate', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Crying', 'Dental Anxiety', 'Dental Care for Children', 'Dental Cavity Preparation', 'Dental Restoration, Permanent', 'Diazepam', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedatives', 'Movement', 'Placebos', 'Rubber Dams', 'Sleep']",17660640,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['E03.155.141', 'E06.045'], ['E03.155.086.231'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.145.179'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D02.033.455.250.130'], ['F01.145.813.115'], ['F01.145.209.530.258', 'F01.525.200.310.300'], ['F01.470.132.300'], ['E06.170.152', 'N02.421.240.190.215'], ['E06.931.325'], ['E06.323.428', 'E06.780.346.737', 'E07.695.190.190'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.070.216'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.696.277.350', 'D27.505.954.427.210.350'], ['G07.568', 'G11.427.410'], ['D26.660', 'E02.785'], ['E06.186.670', 'E07.222.670'], ['F02.830.855', 'G11.561.803']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
15511,Hypolipidemic activity of Anethum graveolens in rats.,"The aerial parts of Anethum graveolens (dillweed) are used in Iran as a hypolipidemic agent. The scientific basis for its use has yet to be established. In this study the hypolipidemic activity of dill powder and its essential oil (its most important fraction) were evaluated in male Wistar rats (180 +/- 20 g) fed a high cholesterol diet. Anethum graveolens essential oil (AGEO) was prepared by hydrodistillation and analysed using GC/MS. AGEO had a yield of 2% and GC/MS analysis showed that alpha-phellandrene (32%), limonene (28%) and carvone (28%) were its major components. Daily oral administration of AGEO to rats at doses of 45, 90 and 180 mg/kg for 2 weeks significantly and in a dose-dependent manner reduced total cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). AGEO also increased significantly high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Anethum graveolens powder when added to the diet of animals showed similar effects on serum lipids.

2509,[Expression and hypoxic regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in esophageal carcinoma].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the the expression and hypoxic regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9.METHODS: VEGF mRNA and MMP-9 mRNA were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 43 esophageal carcinoma specimens including 18 para-tumorous esophageal tissues. The expression of VEGF protein and mean microvessel density (MVD) in 56 specimens were examined by immunohistochemical stain. The effect of hypoxia on VEGF and MMP-9 expression in esophageal cancer cell lines was quantitatively determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).RESULTS: The VEGF expression in the tumorous tissue, being significantly correlated with MVD in the tumor, was remarkably higher than that in the para-tumorous tissue. VEGF and MVD expression in the tumor was significantly associated with stage and metastasis of esophageal carcinoma. The MMP-9 expression in the tumorous tissue, being uncorrelated with vessel count and clinicopathologic features in esophageal carcinoma, was significantly higher than that in the para-tumorous tissue. Hypoxia significantly increased the VEGF expression in esophageal cancer cell lines but did not affect the MMP-9 expression.CONCLUSIONS: The expression of VEGF plays an important role in the angiogenesis and metastasis of esophageal cancer, which is regulated by hypoxia. VEGF may serve as a predictor of progression in esophageal carcinoma and a potential target for antiangiogenic therapy of esophageal carcinoma.","['Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia', 'Lymphokines', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",11977637,"[['D12.644.276.390', 'D12.776.467.390', 'D23.529.390'], ['C04.588.274.476.205', 'C04.588.443.353', 'C06.301.371.205', 'C06.405.117.430', 'C06.405.249.205'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.852.079'], ['D12.644.276.374.480', 'D12.776.467.374.480', 'D23.529.374.480'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.205.360', 'D08.811.277.656.300.480.252.445', 'D08.811.277.656.300.480.525.700.350', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.205.360', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.252.445', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.525.700.350', 'D12.644.276.848.350', 'D12.776.467.836.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200'], ['D12.644.276.100.800', 'D12.776.467.100.800', 'D23.529.100.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
28535,Identification of a putative histidine kinase two-component phosphorelay gene (CaHK1) in Candida albicans.,"We have cloned and analysed the sequence of a putative histidine kinase, two-component gene (CaHK1) from Candida albicans. This gene encodes a 2471 amino acid protein (Cahk1p) with an estimated molecular mass of 281.8 kDa. A homology search of Cahk1p with other proteins in the databases showed that Cahk1p exhibits the greatest homology at its C-terminus with both the sensor and regulator components of prokaryotic and eukaryotic two-component histidine kinases. A further analysis of this homology showed that the Cahk1p possessed both sensor and regulator domains in the same polypeptide. Also, Cahk1p is likely to be a soluble protein. The sensor kinase domain of Cahk1p contains conserved motifs that are characteristic of all histidine kinase proteins, including the putative histidine which is believed to be autophosphorylated during activation, ATP binding motifs and others (F- and N-motifs), with unknown function. The Cahk1p regulator domain also contains conserved aspartate and lysine residues and the putative aspartate, which is secondarily phosphorylated by the autophosphorylated histidine. Finally, according to the codon usage frequency of the CaHK1 gene in comparison with other genes from C. albicans, there would appear to be a low level of expression of the gene.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Candida albicans', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Histidine Kinase', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinases', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",9639313,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.095', 'E05.301.300.074', 'E05.601.100'], ['E05.196.401.114', 'E05.301.300.087', 'E05.601.150'], ['B01.300.107.795.095.326', 'B01.300.381.147.326', 'B01.300.930.176.326'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['G05.360.325'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.364.500', 'G05.360.340.358.024.500', 'G05.360.340.358.365.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.424'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G05.360.600'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682'], ['E05.393.183.620.650', 'E05.393.712'], ['E05.393.760.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
40606,Introducing molecular testing of pyrazinamide susceptibility improves multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment outcomes: a prospective cohort study.,"The current treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) takes a lengthy period of 18-24 months and has a poor cure rate of 50-60%. A multicenter, prospective cohort study was conducted to assess the role of testing for molecular susceptibility to pyrazinamide (PZA) in optimising treatment for MDR-TB.We assigned 76 patients to an optimised molecular susceptibility group and 159 patients to a regular treatment group where PZA susceptibility was not determined. Of these patients, 152 were matched after propensity score matching (76 in the optimised group and 76 in the regular group). Treatment success rate was measured in the propensity-matched cohort as the primary outcome.Patients in the optimised group achieved a higher treatment success rate than those in the regular group (76.3% versus 55.3%, p=0.006). Of 51 patients with isolates that were susceptible to PZA and who were receiving a 12-month regimen, 42 (82.4%) were treated successfully. The optimised group showed faster culture conversion than the regular group (p=0.024). After exclusion of pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB), the treatment outcome in the optimised group was still better than the regular group (83.1% versus 62.1%, p=0.009).Introducing molecular susceptibility testing for PZA improved the treatment outcomes for MDR-TB without the use of new drugs. Introducing PZA for patients with PZA-susceptible (PZA-S) MDR-TB allows the current regimen to be shortened to 12 months with comparable success rates to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended shorter regimen.","['Adult', 'Amidohydrolases', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'China', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrazinamide', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant']",30578402,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D08.811.277.087'], ['D27.505.954.122.085.255'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['G06.099.225.812', 'G06.225.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.300.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['G05.365.590'], ['B03.510.024.962.500.702', 'B03.510.460.400.410.552.552.702'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D03.383.679.750'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846.775']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

PC-vaccine stimulated IgM and IgG2, but little IgG1, anti-PC -antibodies. No memory was induced and immunization in CFA produced tolerance. PC-KLH, on the other hand, stimulated IgM, IgG2, and IgG1 anti-PC antibodies with carrier-specific memory. Hapten inhibition of plaque formation showed uniform binding patterns with minor, but significant, differences between antiPC-vaccine and anti-PC-KLH antibodies. The antibodies were characterized by IEF and idiotypic analyses. Early after immunization with PC-vaccine, guinea pigs had restricted IEF patterns which in inbred, but not outbred animals were indistinguishable between individuals. These patterns remained restricted but more individualized with time after immunization. Anti-PC-KLH antibodies showed more heterogeneity and individuality.

A randomized, controlled clinical study].","Pharmacological prophylaxis is routinely applied after total hip replacement. Although it effectively reduces deep-vein thrombosis, side effects (bleeding, haematoma, swelling, thrombocytopenia) are not infrequent. Since in Germany use of foot pumps as only means of prophylaxis is unpopular, we investigated their efficacy and safety in a randomized study. 106 patients used either low molecular weight heparin (Fraxiparin, Sanofi-Synthelabo, Germany) or the foot-pump (A-V Impulse System, Orthofix, M?hltal, Germany), and were monitored for deep-vein thrombosis using serial duplex sonography on postoperative days 4, 12 and 45. Clinical observations included daily measurements of thigh circumference, recording of postoperative drainage amounts, and monitoring of wound healing. None of the 50 patients treated with the foot-pump developed deep-vein thrombosis, while 4 of the 50 patients (8 per cent) on pharmacological prophylaxis did so. Six patients stopped using the foot-pump during the study. One patient developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Patients on mechanical prophylaxis had smaller amounts of drainage (mean 247 ml vs. 272 ml, p = 0.485) and significantly less swelling of the thigh (10 mm compared with 15 mm, p or = < 0.001), The good results in terms of prevention of thromboembolic complications and soft tissue swelling favour the general use of foot pumps as mechanical prophylaxis.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticoagulants', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip', 'Bandages', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nadroparin', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Physical Therapy Modalities', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color', 'Venous Thrombosis']",12910861,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.502.119'], ['E04.555.110.110.110', 'E04.650.110.110', 'E04.680.101.110.110'], ['E07.101'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D09.698.373.400.300.600'], ['N04.761.559', 'N05.715.360.575'], ['E02.779', 'E02.831.535'], ['C23.550.767'], ['C08.381.746', 'C14.907.355.350.700'], ['C15.378.140.855'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.350.850.850.850.850'], ['C14.907.355.830.925']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
33122,Tumor budding and poorly-differentiated cluster in prognostication in Stage II colon cancer.,"Comparison between tumor budding (TB) and poorly-differentiated clusters (PDC) for prognostication in Stage II colon cancer was not extensively studied in literature. In this retrospective study, we assessed TB (according to the consensus statement in 2016) and PDC in 135 Stage II colon adenocarcinoma resection specimens. Counting of TB and PDC was performed on H&E slides. High-grade TB (Bd3 (?10 tumor buds in 0.785 mm2)) and high-grade PDC (Grade 3 (?10)) were found in 20% and 17% of cases respectively. High-grade TB was associated with pT4 (p = 0.008) and presence of lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.001). There was correlation between TB and PDC grades (p < 0.001), in which both grades were the same or one grade apart in majority of the cases (95%). Both TB and PDC correlated with 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) (DSS for TB: 89% (Bd1); 73% (Bd2); 52% (Bd3), p = 0.001) (DSS for PDC: 88% (Grade 1); 72% (Grade 2); 61% (Grade 3), p = 0.021). Survival curves of Stage II colon cancer could be further stratified by TB and PDC (log-rank tests: TB p < 0.001; PDC p = 0.009). Combining TB and PDC grades into single grading system (high-grade: Bd3 + G2, Bd2 + G3, Bd3 + G3; low-grade: other combinations) was found to have strong correlation with both 5-year DSS and OS (both p < 0.001). Our study has confirmed TB and PDC as independent prognostic factors in Stage II colon cancer, and might help selecting high-risk patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",29487008,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.612'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
7436,Occupational exposure to blood and other bodily fluids at a military hospital in Iraq.,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to bloodborne pathogens, namely HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, remains a risk for healthcare workers. Given the austere and challenging environments in a combat zone, it is unclear to what extent blood and other bodily fluid occupational exposures pose a risk of infection for military healthcare workers deployed to a level III military treatment facility in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.METHODS: This is a retrospective review of electronic infection control records at the Air Force Theater Hospital in Iraq in which blood and other bodily fluid occupational exposure data were available: October 1, 2005 through May 31, 2006 and January 15, 2007 through April 30, 2007.RESULTS: During the first study period, there were 46 exposures for an average monthly exposure of 5.8 (range, 2-16 per month). The majority of exposures were percutaneous fingersticks (74%), whereas the remainder were splashes (17%) or not documented (9%). During the second study period, there were 19 exposures with percutaneous device and splash exposure encompassing 68% and 32% of cases, respectively. The majority of occurrences were in the intensive care unit (53%) and primarily among nurses (37%). Overall, there were 65 exposures per 1,000 persons during the year review.CONCLUSIONS: During the time periods evaluated, a substantial number of blood and other bodily fluid exposures occurred in a combat zone military healthcare facility. This finding is comparable to US civilian institutions. Maintaining programs for preventing, tracking, and implementing postexposure prophylaxis remain a worthy and achievable goal at every military treatment facility, regardless of the austerity of the environment.","['Accidents, Occupational', 'Blood-Borne Pathogens', 'Hospitals, Military', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iraq War, 2003-2011', 'Needlestick Injuries', 'Personnel, Hospital', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trauma Centers']",19359972,"[['N06.850.135.240'], ['B05.155'], ['N02.278.421.510.180.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['I01.880.735.950.250.782', 'K01.400.504.984.249'], ['C26.986.950.500'], ['M01.526.485.740', 'N02.360.740'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.336.500', 'N02.421.297.195.480', 'N04.452.442.452.422.336.400']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

589,Can Abdominal Computed Tomography Imaging Help Accurately Identify a Dedifferentiated Component in a Well-Differentiated Liposarcoma?,"PURPOSE: To assess the ability of computed tomography (CT) to differentiate an atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) from a WDLPS with a dedifferentiated component (DDLPS) within it.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine untreated patients with abdominal atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas who had undergone contrast-enhanced CT were identified using an institutional database. Three radiologists who were blinded to the pathology findings evaluated all the images independently to determine whether a dedifferentiated component was present within the WDLPS. The CT images were evaluated for fat content (?25% or >25%); presence of ground-glass density, enhancing and/or necrotic nodules; presence of a capsule surrounding the mass; septations; and presence and pattern of calcifications. A multivariate logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations was used to correlate imaging features with pathology findings. Kappa statistics were calculated to assess agreement between the three radiologists.RESULTS: On the basis of pathological findings, 12 patients had been diagnosed with DDLPS within a WDLPS and 37 had been diagnosed with WDLPS. The presence of an enhancing or a centrally necrotic nodule within the atypical lipomatous tumor was associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (P = 0.02 and P = 0.0003, respectively). The three readers showed almost perfect agreement in overall diagnosis (ê r = 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.99).CONCLUSIONS: An enhancing or centrally necrotic nodule may be indicative of a dedifferentiated component in well-differentiated liposarcoma. Ground-glass density nodules may not be indicative of dedifferentiation.","['Abdominal Neoplasms', 'Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposarcoma', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Radiography, Abdominal', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",27454788,"[['C04.588.033'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.171'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.450.550.420', 'C04.557.450.795.465'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['E01.370.350.700.715'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
38607,The dynamics of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation predict relapse in patients with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia.,"BACKGROUND: The optimal monitoring schedules and cutoff minimal residual disease (MRD) levels for the accurate prediction of relapse at all time points after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remain unclear in patients with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).METHODS: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels were measured in bone marrow samples collected from 208 patients at scheduled time points after transplantation (1530 samples in total).RESULTS: A total of 92.3% of the requested samples were collected, and 74.0% of patients had complete sample collection. The 1-, 3-, and 6-month RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels could significantly discriminate between continuous complete remission and a hematologic relapse at 1.5-3, 4-6, and 7-12 months but not at >3, >6, and >12 months, respectively. Over 90% of the 175 patients who were in continuous complete remission had a ?3-log reduction in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels from the time of diagnosis at each time point after transplantation and a ?4-log reduction at ?12 months. A <3-log reduction within 12 months and/or a <4-log reduction at ?12 months was significantly related to a higher 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rate in both the entire cohort and the patients with no intervention after HSCT (58.4 vs. 2.2%, 76.5 vs. 2.0%; all P < 0.0001). Patients who had received a preemptive donor lymphocyte infusion when the increase in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts was ?1-log according to the above dual cutoff values had significantly lower 1-year CIR rate after intervention than the patients who had received an infusion when the increase was >1-log (0 vs. 55.0%, P = 0.015).CONCLUSIONS: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts with a <3-log reduction from diagnosis within 12 months and/or a <4-log reduction at ?12 months after allo-HSCT could accurately predict relapse and may prompt a timely intervention in patients with t(8;21) AML.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Neoplasm', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recurrence', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",28166825,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['A01.941.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.505.510', 'G05.360.162.520.300.505.510'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.325.340', 'G05.360.162.520.300.325.340'], ['D12.776.930.155.200.200'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['G05.308.370.500'], ['E02.095.147.500.500.500', 'E04.936.225.687.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.337.539.275'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.700', 'C23.550.727.700'], ['D12.776.602.500.500', 'D12.776.624.664.500'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D13.444.735.615'], ['D12.776.624.664.700.936', 'D12.776.930.780.625.575'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['C23.550.210.870', 'G05.365.590.175.870', 'G05.558.860'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
32262,Roles of insulin receptor substrate-1 and Shc on insulin-like growth factor I receptor signaling in early passages of cultured human fibroblasts.,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) improves glucose metabolism and growth in patients with leprechaunism. We investigated signal transduction through IGF-I receptor in comparison with epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in early passages of cultured skin fibroblasts from a normal subject and a patient with leprechaunism whose insulin receptor tyrosine kinase was almost nonexistent. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) became tyrosine-phosphorylated and bound growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) quickly by IGF-I. The association of Shc with GRB2 by IGF-I was detected by immunoblot with anti-Shc antibody but was hardly visible with antiphosphotyrosine antibody, which was in marked contrast to efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc by EGF. However, the potency of IGF-I for DNA synthesis was far stronger than EGF, which was not parallel with the potency of these growth factors to activate Shc or MAP kinase. Rather, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity, which was activated by IGF-I about 5- to 10-fold more strongly than EGF, appeared to correlate with mitogenesis. Signal transduction pathways following IGF-I receptor or EGF receptor activation were indistinguishable between the normal subject and the patient. Our results strongly suggest that in human skin fibroblasts, which represent a more physiological cell culture: 1) IRS-1, rather than Shc, is the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein binding GRB2 in initial phase of IGF-I signaling; 2) mitogenic potency of receptor tyrosine kinases such as IGF-I receptor and EGF receptor may not be determined solely by the amount of Shc-GRB2 complex or the activity of MAP kinase; and 3) in contrast to previous reports, IGF-I and EGF receptor signalings are not defective in leprechaunism.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Mitogens', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Proteins', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1', 'Receptor, Insulin', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1']",9003010,"[['D12.644.360.024', 'D12.776.157.057', 'D12.776.476.024'], ['D12.776.543.990.150'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.125', 'D12.644.360.100', 'D12.776.476.100'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D06.472.317.350', 'D12.644.276.382.500', 'D12.776.467.382.500', 'D23.529.382.500'], ['D12.644.276.624.120', 'D12.776.467.624.120', 'D23.529.624.120'], ['A11.329.228'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.380', 'E05.601.470.380'], ['D12.644.360.024.301', 'D12.776.157.057.045', 'D12.776.476.024.382'], ['D12.644.276.937.400', 'D12.776.124.862.400', 'D12.776.467.937.400', 'D23.529.937.400'], ['D27.505.519.593.624'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D12.776.744'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D12.125.072.050.875.750', 'D12.125.740.740'], ['D12.776'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.185', 'D12.776.543.750.630.468', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.780.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.200', 'D12.776.543.750.630.484', 'D12.776.543.750.750.580.300'], ['D12.644.360.024.330', 'D12.776.157.057.162', 'D12.776.476.024.424'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.644.360.024.330.500', 'D12.776.157.057.162.500', 'D12.776.476.024.424.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
161,"Social and racial inequalities in preterm births in Western Australia, 1984 to 2006.","Preterm birth is associated with a range of childhood morbidities and in industrialised societies is the primary cause of infant mortality. Social and racial inequalities in preterm birth have been reported in North America, UK, Europe and New Zealand. This study utilised population-level data to investigate social and racial inequalities in preterm birth among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants in Western Australia. All live, singleton births between 1984 and 2006 (n = 567 468) were included, and multilevel multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate relative differences in preterm infants between socio-economic groups. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants were analysed separately. The prevalence of preterm births increased from 7.1% in 1984-88 to 7.5% in 1999-2003, before decreasing to 7.2% in 2004-06. Inequalities in preterm births between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants increased over time, with the percentage of preterm births being almost twofold higher for Aboriginal infants (14.8%), compared with non-Aboriginal infants (7.6%). A significant portion of the disparity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants is attributable to parental socio-economic and demographic characteristics, though the disparity continues to persist even after adjustment for these factors. While the overall rates of preterm birth in Western Australia have remained fairly static over the last two decades, the disparity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants has increased and is now similar to inequalities seen 20 years ago. These findings highlight a major public health issue that should be of great concern, given the short- and long-term morbidities and complications associated with preterm birth.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oceanic Ancestry Group', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Western Australia', 'Young Adult']",20618725,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['M01.686.508.600'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['C13.703.420.491.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['Z01.639.100.996', 'Z01.678.100.373.996'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
39129,The influence of film processing temperature and time on mammographic image quality.,"High image quality and low radiation levels are essential in mammography. This study investigates the effect of changes in processor temperatures and developing times on sensitometric findings. These findings were matched with the changes in the image quality during similar changes in the developing parameters. Temperatures ranging between 35 degrees C and 40 degrees C and developing times from 20 s and 50 s were investigated. Higher developing temperatures and increased developing times resulted in an increase in film speed and film contrast. A definite pattern of change could be demonstrated in film speed and film contrast during sensitometry. The same pattern of change could, however, not be demonstrated in the quality of phantom images under similar circumstances. The base plus fog level was not adversely affected. Sensitometric findings of film speed can be effectively used as an indicator of radiation exposure to the patient, but cannot be used to establish the developing parameters that will give the best image quality. Both these methods should be used to determine which processing variables should be used to obtain a combination of the best image with radiation as low as possible. Recommendations for optimum processing parameters are made for the films and processing chemistry investigated.","['Female', 'Humans', 'Mammography', 'Models, Structural', 'Technology, Radiologic', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'X-Ray Film']",7719681,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.700.500'], ['J01.897.280.500.545', 'L01.178.820.090.545'], ['E05.920', 'H02.010.850', 'J01.897.891'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E07.960']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0

A 31-year-old man who had a family history of angioedema was admitted to our hospital with complaints of abdominal pain and swelling of extremities. Computed tomography scan and endoscopy carried out during this attack revealed transient gastrointestinal wall edema which, along with decreased levels of serum C4 and C1 inhibitor, confirmed the diagnosis of HAE with gastrointestinal involvement. During the attack, the gastric mucosa was erythematous and edematous, and parts of its surface bulged into the gastric lumen, resembling a submucosal tumor, as a result of massive submucosal edema. During the healing process, a number of small nodules and raised erosions developed over the entire gastric mucosal surface after healing of prominent gastric edema. Within 55 days, the gastric mucosa had returned to normal. The endoscopic findings for the stomach in HAE have not, to our knowledge, been previously described.","['Adult', 'Angioedema', 'Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins', 'Complement C4', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Male']",10376461,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C14.907.079', 'C17.800.862.945.066', 'C20.543.480.904.066'], ['D12.644.861.140', 'D12.776.124.486.274.920.250', 'D12.776.872.140'], ['D12.776.124.486.274.350'], ['E01.370.372.250.250', 'E01.370.388.250.250.250', 'E04.210.240.250', 'E04.502.250.250.250'], ['A03.556.875.875.440', 'A10.615.550.291'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

First, the A* channel in CIE LAB color space is extracted for contrast enhancement. Then, in order to effectively extract cytoplasm boundaries when image histograms present non-bimodal distribution, Otsu multiple thresholding is performed on the contrast enhanced image to generate initial segments, based on which the segments are refined by the multi-way graph cut method. We use 21 cervical cell images with non-ideal imaging condition to evaluate cytoplasm segmentation performance.

5299,"Heterotrimeric G protein betagamma subunits stimulate FLJ00018, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 and Cdc42.","We previously reported that Gbetagamma signaling regulates cell spreading or cell shape change through activation of a Rho family small GTPase, suggesting the existence of a Gbetagamma-regulated Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF). In this study we examined various RhoGEF clones, found FLJ00018 to beaGbetagamma-activated RhoGEF, and investigated the molecular mechanism of Gbetagamma-induced activation of Rho family GTPases. Co-expression of the genes for FLJ00018 and Gbetagamma enhanced serum response element-mediated gene transcription in HEK-293 cells. Combined expression of Gbetagamma and FLJ00018 significantly induced activation of Rac and Cdc42 but not RhoA. FLJ00018 also enhanced gene transcription induced by carbachol-stimulated m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and this enhancement was blocked by pertussis toxin. Furthermore, we demonstrated Gbetagamma to interact directly with the N-terminal region of FLJ00018 and the N-terminal fragment of this molecule to inhibit serum response element-dependent transcription induced by Gbetagamma/FLJ00018 and carbachol. In NIH3T3 cells, FLJ00018 enhanced lysophosphatidic acid-induced cell spreading, which was also blocked by the N-terminal fragment of FLJ00018. These results provide evidence for a signaling pathway by which G(i)-coupled receptor specifically induces Rac and Cdc42 activation through direct interaction of Gbetagamma with FLJ00018.","['Animals', 'Carbachol', 'Cell Shape', 'Cholinergic Agonists', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Lysophospholipids', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neuropeptides', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Receptor, Muscarinic M2', 'Serum Response Element', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein']",18045877,"[['B01.050'], ['D02.092.877.883.333.115', 'D02.675.276.232.115'], ['G04.320'], ['D27.505.519.625.120.140', 'D27.505.696.577.120.140'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['G05.297'], ['D12.644.360.325.300', 'D12.776.476.325.300'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.200', 'D12.644.360.360', 'D12.776.157.325.332', 'D12.776.476.375', 'D12.776.543.325'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D10.570.755.375.760.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A11.251.210.100.550', 'A11.329.228.100.550'], ['D12.644.400', 'D12.776.631.650'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.115.680', 'D23.946.123.946.690', 'D23.946.896.980.690'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.475.200', 'D12.776.543.750.720.360.500.200'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.330.700.800', 'G02.111.570.080.689.675.700.800', 'G05.360.080.689.330.700.800', 'G05.360.080.689.675.700.800', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.249.765.800', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680.765.800'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.700.050', 'D12.644.360.525.700.050', 'D12.776.157.325.515.700.050', 'D12.776.476.525.700.050'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.700.100', 'D12.644.360.525.700.100', 'D12.776.157.325.515.700.100', 'D12.776.476.525.700.100'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.700.100.500', 'D12.644.360.525.700.100.100', 'D12.776.157.325.515.700.100.100', 'D12.776.476.525.700.100.100'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.700', 'D12.644.360.525.700', 'D12.776.157.325.515.700', 'D12.776.476.525.700'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.700.200', 'D12.644.360.525.700.200', 'D12.776.157.325.515.700.200', 'D12.776.476.525.700.200']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6642,Autocrine growth factors for human tumor clonogenic cells.,"A human epithelial-derived cell line, SW-13, releases a soluble substance that functions as an autocrine growth factor. SW-13 cells, derived from a human adenocarcinoma of the adrenal cortex, form a few small colonies when suspended in soft agar at low densities. The number of colonies increased significantly when either viable SW-13 cells or serum-free medium conditioned by SW-13 cells (CM) was added to agar underlayers. CM increased colony formation in a dose-dependent fashion. Clonal growth at low cell densities was dependent on the presence of both horse serum and SW-13 CM. Neither activity alone was capable of sustaining growth. Even when cells were plated at high densities CM could not substitute for serum, but could reduce the threshold serum concentration. The results suggest that autocrine and serum-derived factors act in concert to maintain clonal growth of epithelial tumor cells in soft agar.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adrenal Gland Neoplasms', 'Agar', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Epithelium', 'Growth Substances', 'Humans']",4067361,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['C04.588.322.078', 'C19.053.347', 'C19.344.078'], ['D09.698.360.041'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['A10.272'], ['D27.505.696.377'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23386,Neurofibromatosis 2: clinical and DNA linkage studies of a large kindred.,"At least eight provisional categories of neurofibromatosis have been proposed. Among these, neurofibromatosis 1 (von Recklinghausen's disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis) and neurofibromatosis 2 (central or bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis) have been established as distinct disorders. We studied 15 affected male and 8 affected female members of one large kindred with neurofibromatosis 2. None of the patients met the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis 1. Between the ages of 15 and 53 years, the patients had multiple central nervous system tumors of various types--mainly, bilateral acoustic neuromas. Two or more tumors eventually developed in 20 of the patients; 9 had evidence of only bilateral acoustic neuromas. Meningiomas and ependymomas were more common among the young patients; those who initially presented with acoustic neuromas were nearly a decade older. Intracranial nontumoral calcifications were present in most patients and were also found in symptom-free children. The presence of such lesions is probably a prodromic feature of neurofibromatosis 2. Simultaneous analysis of D22S1 and IGLV DNA markers for coinheritance with neurofibromatosis 2 indicates that the locus for the disease is near the center of the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11.1----22q13.1). The eventual isolation of this disease gene may reveal a cause of the most common intracranial tumors in humans.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Ependymoma', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms', 'Meningioma', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neuroma, Acoustic', 'Pedigree']",3134615,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['C04.588.614.250.195', 'C10.228.140.211', 'C10.551.240.250'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.505.515', 'G05.360.162.520.300.505.515'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.380.290', 'C04.557.470.670.380.290', 'C04.557.580.625.600.380.290'], ['G05.348'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.614.250.580', 'C10.551.240.500'], ['C04.557.580.520', 'C04.557.645.520', 'C04.588.614.250.580.500', 'C10.551.240.500.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.557.580.600.580.590.650', 'C04.700.631.650', 'C10.562.600.500', 'C10.574.500.549.400', 'C10.668.829.675', 'C16.320.400.560.400', 'C16.320.700.633.650'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.595.610', 'C04.557.580.600.610.595.610', 'C04.557.580.625.650.595.610', 'C04.588.614.300.015', 'C04.588.614.596.240.015', 'C09.218.807.800.675', 'C09.647.675', 'C10.292.225.750', 'C10.292.910.600'], ['E05.393.673']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

We used strain Azotobacter chroococcum 7B, an effective producer of PHB, for biosynthesis of not only homopolymer and its main copolymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHB-HV), but also novel terpolymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PHB-HV-PEG), using sucrose as the primary carbon source and valeric acid and poly(ethylene glycol) 300 (PEG 300) as additional carbon sources. The chemical structure of PHB-HV-PEG was confirmed by (1)H nuclear-magnetic resonance analysis. The physico-chemical properties (molecular weight, crystallinity, hydrophilicity, surface energy) of produced biopolymer, the protein adsorption to the terpolymer, and cell growth on biopolymer films were studied. Despite of low EG-monomers content in bacterial-origin PHB-HV-PEG polymer, the terpolymer demonstrated significant improvement in biocompatibility in vitro in contrast to PHB and PHB-HV polymers, which may be coupled with increased protein adsorption, hydrophilicity and surface roughness of PEG-containing copolymer.","['Azotobacter', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biopolymers', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Molecular Weight']",23468935,"[['B03.440.400.425.625.050', 'B03.660.250.580.022'], ['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['D05.750.078', 'D25.720.099', 'J01.637.051.720.099'], ['E05.196.131.310', 'E05.196.370.310'], ['G04.022'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['E01.370.350.515.666.400', 'E05.595.666.400'], ['G02.494']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
41993,Redox Engineering by Ectopic Overexpression of NADH Kinase in Recombinant Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii,"High-level expression and secretion of heterologous proteins in yeast cause an increased energy demand, which may result in altered metabolic flux distributions. Moreover, recombinant protein overproduction often results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress, causing deviations from the optimal NAD(P)H regeneration balance. In this context, overexpression of genes encoding enzymes catalyzing endogenous NADPH-producing reactions, such as the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, has been previously shown to improve protein production in Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella spp.). In this study, we evaluate the overexpression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae POS5-encoded NADH kinase in a recombinant P. pastoris strain as an alternative approach to overcome such redox constraints. Specifically, POS5 was cooverexpressed in a strain secreting an antibody fragment, either by directing Pos5 to the cytosol or to the mitochondria. The physiology of the resulting strains was evaluated in continuous cultivations with glycerol or glucose as the sole carbon source, as well as under hypoxia (on glucose). Cytosolic targeting of Pos5 NADH kinase resulted in lower biomass-substrate yields but allowed for a 2-fold increase in product specific productivity. In contrast, Pos5 NADH kinase targeting to the mitochondria did not affect growth physiology and recombinant protein production significantly. Growth physiological parameters were in silico evaluated using the recent upgraded version (v3.0) of the P. pastoris consensus genome-scale metabolic model iMT1026, providing insights on the impact of POS5 overexpression on metabolic flux distributions.IMPORTANCE Recombinant protein overproduction often results in oxidative stress, causing deviations from the optimal redox cofactor regeneration balance. This becomes one of the limiting factors in obtaining high levels of heterologous protein production. Overexpression of redox-affecting enzymes has been explored in other organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a means to fine tune the cofactor regeneration balance in order to obtain higher protein titers. In the present work, this strategy is explored in P. pastoris In particular, one NADH kinase enzyme from S. cerevisiae (Pos5) is used, either in the cytosol or in mitochondria of P. pastoris, and its impact on the production of a model protein (antibody fragment) is evaluated. A significant improvement in the production of the model protein is observed when the kinase is directed to the cytosol. These results are significant in the field of heterologous protein production in general and in particular in the development of improved metabolic engineering strategies for P. pastoris.","['Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Metabolic Engineering', 'Microorganisms, Genetically-Modified', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)', 'Pichia', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins']",31757828,"[['G05.308.330'], ['E05.393.420.526', 'E05.481.500.311.249', 'J01.293.069.249.249'], ['B05.620.368'], ['D12.776.575'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D08.811.913.696.620'], ['B01.300.107.795.700', 'B01.300.930.600'], ['D12.776.828'], ['B01.300.107.795.785.800', 'B01.300.930.705.655'], ['D12.776.354.750']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

34228,Antiendothelial antibodies in sera of patients with infective endocarditis.,"Infective endocarditis is characterized by the colonization of endocardium by microorganisms. Except for Staphylococcus aureus, microorganisms are not able to adhere to and grow on endocardial cells; prior damage, e.g., by shear stress or other mechanical factors, is necessary. But other causes may well have a share. This study was, therefore, designed to identify immunological factors, especially antibodies against endothelial cells, which could contribute to the initiation of endocardial injury. Sera of patients with infective endocarditis and healthy controls were investigated for the presence of antibodies against endothelial antigen. As the antigen source human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used. Antibodies against endothelial cells were detected by indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA, immunoblotting, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and antibody mediated cytotoxicity. Antibodies against endothelial cells were found in seven out of fifteen patients. These antibodies were directed against cytoplasmic structures and only appeared in the course of the disease. A correlation between the presence of these antibodies and disease activity or the outcome of disease was not observed.

Mean basal LH was 7.7 +/- 1.0 mIU/ml, increased to a maximum of 120 +/- 22.7 mIU/ml, and then declined to levels between 28--34 mIU/ml for the last 30 hrs of infusion; FSH rose from 3.7 to 11.4 mIU/ml (p less than 0.05) at 16 hrs and then returned to baseline. Testosterone levels rose by 50% at 12 hrs, and remained elevated throughout with maximum values between 6.6 and 12 ng/ml. Estradiol-17beta levels were 26.2 +/- 4.7 pg/ml basally, rose to 104 +/- 8 pg/ml and while levels declined therafter, they were significantly above baseline throughout the 72 hrs. Plasma androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone levels also showed significant increases. By contrast, transient elevations in pregnenolone and 17-hydroxypregnenolone levels probably corresponded to the nomral morning rise in plasma levels of these steroids; 17-hydroxyprogesterone rose from 1.3 +/- 0.15 to 3.9 +/- 0.26 ng/ml at 12 hrs and remained elevated through the infusion. An increase in 17-hydroxyprogesterone:testosterone ratio was observed in all subjects. Thus, chronic LHRH infusion effected a persistent increase in endogenous LH with, in turn, prolonged stimulation of gonadal steroid secretion.","['17-alpha-Hydroxypregnenolone', 'Adult', 'Androgens', 'Androstenedione', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone', 'Estradiol', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Gonadotropins, Pituitary', 'Humans', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Male', 'Progesterone', 'Progestins', 'Testosterone']",156193,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
155,Restenosis after transluminal coronary angioplasty detected with exercise-gated radionuclide ventriculography.,"Forty-one patients were evaluated with exercise-gated radionuclide ventriculography before and within 4 days after successful transluminal coronary angioplasty and 4 to 12 months later. Patients were subgrouped according to the degree of restenosis demonstrated angiographically at 4 to 12 months (Group I [n = 23]: less than or equal to 20%; Group II [n = 10]: greater than 20% but less than 50%; Group III [n = 8]: greater than or equal to 50%). Patients with abnormal findings on gated radionuclide ventriculography (less than 5 point increase in ejection fraction or wall motion deterioration) early after angioplasty were eventually found to have a greater degree of restenosis than were patients with normal findings (41.2 +/- 30.3 versus 19.0 +/- 25.4% restenosis, p less than 0.0001). The accuracy of abnormal radionuclide ventriculography in predicting 50% or greater restenosis was 73% immediately after angioplasty and 77% at the time of follow-up angiography. Gated radionuclide ventriculographic results were abnormal in 5% of Group I patients compared with 75% of Group III patients (p less than 0.01) early after angioplasty; at late follow-up, they were abnormal in 27% of Group I patients compared with 88% of Group III patients (p less than 0.01). Group I patients had a greater increase in ejection fraction than did Group III patients at early (+11.3 +/- 7.5 versus + 3.5 +/- 6.5 points, p less than 0.01) and late (+11.8 +/- 7.8 versus -1.9 +/- 8.7 points, p less than 0.0005) follow-up. It is concluded that gated radionuclide ventriculography is useful in predicting coronary restenosis after transluminal coronary angioplasty.","['Aged', 'Angioplasty, Balloon', 'Constriction, Pathologic', 'Coronary Disease', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Physical Exertion', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Recurrence', 'Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m', 'Stroke Volume', 'Time Factors']",6094635,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E02.148.050.060', 'E04.100.814.529.124.060', 'E04.502.382.124.060', 'E05.157.016.060'], ['C23.300.287'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['A07.015.114.269', 'A07.015.908.194'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['A07.541'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G11.427.683'], ['E01.370.350.710', 'E01.370.384.730'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['D01.925.800'], ['E01.370.370.380.150.700', 'G09.330.380.124.882'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
27940,Acceleration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced neutrophilic nuclear lobulation by overexpression of Lyn tyrosine kinase.,"Stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) induces myeloid precursor cells to differentiate into neutrophils, and tyrosine phosphorylation of certain cellular proteins is crucial to this process. However, the signaling pathways for neutrophil differentiation are still obscure. As the Src-like tyrosine kinase, Lyn, has been reported to play a role in G-CSF-induced proliferation in avian lymphoid cells, we examined its involvement in G-CSF-induced signal transduction in mammalian cells. Expression plasmids for wild-type Lyn (Lyn) and kinase-negative Lyn (LynKN) were introduced into a murine granulocyte precursor cell line, GM-I62M, that can respond to G-CSF with neutrophil differentiation, and cell lines that overexpressed these molecules (GM-Lyn, GM-LynKN) were established. Upon G-CSF stimulation, both the GM-Lyn and GM-LynKN cells began to differentiate into neutrophils, showing early morphological changes within a few days, much more rapidly than did the parental cells, which started to exhibit nuclear lobulation about 10 days after the cells were transferred to G-CSF-containing medium. However, the time course of expression of the myeloperoxidase gene, another neutrophil differentiation marker, was not affected by the overexpression of Lyn or LynKN. Therefore, in normal cells, protein interactions with Lyn, but not its kinase activity, are important for the induction of G-CSF-induced neutrophilic nuclear lobulation in mammalian granulopoiesis.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils', 'Peroxidase', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tyrosine', 'src-Family Kinases']",11784333,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.152'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['D12.644.276.374.410.240.350', 'D12.776.395.240.200', 'D12.776.467.374.410.240.350', 'D23.529.374.410.240.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['D08.811.682.732.700'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D12.125.072.050.875'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
21621,Evaluation of melt granulation and ultrasonic spray congealing as techniques to enhance the dissolution of praziquantel.,"Praziquantel (PZQ), an anthelminthic drug widely used in developing countries, is classified in Class II in the Biopharmaceutics Classification Systems; this means that PZQ has very low water solubility and high permeability, thus the dissolution is the absorption rate-limiting factor. The aim of this work was to evaluate the suitability of melt granulation and ultrasonic spray congealing as techniques for enhancing the dissolution rate of PZQ. Granules in high shear mixer were prepared by melt granulation, using polyethylene glycol 4000 or poloxamer 188 as meltable binders and alpha-lactose monohydrate as a filler. Quite regularly shaped granules having main size fraction in the range 200-500 microm were obtained using both formulations; however, only poloxamer 188 granules demonstrated a significant (P=0.05) increase of the PZQ dissolution rate compared to pure drug. To evaluate the potential of ultrasonic spray congealing, Gelucire 50/13 microparticles having different drug to carrier ratios (5, 10, 20 and 30%, w/w) were then prepared. The results showed that all the microparticles had a significant higher dissolution rate (P=0.05) respect to pure PZQ. The increase of the PZQ content considerably decreased the dissolution rate of the drug: 5 and 10% PZQ loaded systems evidenced dissolution significantly enhanced compared to 20 and 30% PZQ microparticles. The microparticle's characterisation, performed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Hot Stage Microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and FT-Infrared analysis, evidenced the absence of both modifications of the solid state of PZQ and of significant interactions between the drug and the carrier. In conclusion, melt granulation and ultrasonic spray congealing could be proposed as solvent free, rapid and low expensive manufacturing methods to increase the in vitro dissolution rate of PZQ.","['Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Drug Compounding', 'Fats', 'Nanoparticles', 'Oils', 'Particle Size', 'Pharmaceutical Solutions', 'Poloxamer', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Powders', 'Praziquantel', 'Solubility', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Ultrasonics', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",16697539,"[['E05.196.131.310', 'E05.196.370.310'], ['H01.158.703.007', 'H01.181.466'], ['E05.916.270'], ['D10.212'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['D10.627'], ['G02.712'], ['D26.776.708', 'D27.505.954.578', 'D27.720.752'], ['D02.033.455.250.700.682', 'D05.750.741.667', 'D25.720.741.667', 'J01.637.051.720.741.667'], ['D02.033.455.250.700', 'D05.750.741', 'D25.720.741', 'J01.637.051.720.741'], ['D26.255.779'], ['D03.633.100.531.690'], ['G02.805'], ['E05.196.712.726.676.700', 'E05.196.867.826.676.700'], ['H01.671.031.849'], ['E05.196.309.742', 'E05.196.822.950', 'G01.867.950', 'G02.965']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

In the first season (September 1997-January 1998), eight male swimmers (age 19-25 years) of the Italian National Team participated, after 12 weeks of increased training volume, in a preparatory national competition (PWC) and then, after a further 6 weeks of specific training, in the World Championships (WC, both competitions in a 50-m pool), which represented the main competition at the end of the 18-week-long winter season. In the second season (September 1998-December 1998), a group of ten high-level male swimmers (18-22 years) participated, after 8 weeks of increased training volume, in a preparatory national competition (PIC) and then, after a further 6 weeks of specific training, in the Italian Championships (IC, both competitions in a 25-m pool), the main competition at the end of the 14-week-long winter season. A tapering period lasting 1-3 weeks was observed before the main competition in both seasons. All swimmers were competing at distances of up to 400 m; two of them participated in the study in both seasons. The swimming velocities and post-competition blood lactate concentrations were higher in the main competitions than in the preparatory competitions in both seasons. Pre-competition plasma cortisol (CORT) concentrations were higher than the initial values at the beginning of the season, reaching maximal values at the preparatory competitions and then decreasing before the main competitions in both seasons. The percentage increase in individual swimming velocity from the preparatory to the main competition was positively correlated with the corresponding increase in post-competition blood lactate (r = 0.63, P = 0.046) in the 1997 season (WC), and negatively correlated with the corresponding decrease in pre-competition CORT concentration (r = -0.66, P = 0.019) in the 1998 season (IC). Our results indicate that a decrease in pre-competition CORT could be a prerequisite for an improvement in swimming performance.","['Adult', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Lactic Acid', 'Male', 'Physical Fitness', 'Swimming']",10985589,"[['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['G11.427.685', 'I03.450.642.845.054.800', 'N01.400.545'], ['G11.427.410.568.800', 'G11.427.410.698.277.875', 'I03.350.875', 'I03.450.642.845.945.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
37276,Effect of exchange transfusion on elimination of antibiotics in premature infants.,"Although the use of exchange transfusion has become routine in intensive care nurseries, little information is available on drug loss resulting from exchange transfusion. The aim of this study was to review the effect of exchange transfusion on the elimination of some antibiotics in premature infants according to the recent pharmacokinetic data.

Our data suggest that exchange transfusion can significantly decrease the serum concentrations of antibiotics with smaller volumes of distribution, but the drug loss of antibiotics with larger volumes of distribution can be acceptable.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Exchange Transfusion, Whole Blood', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature']",8191611,"[['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['E02.095.135.469'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.429'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.703.520.520']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
3642,[Follow-up and counselling after pelvic inflammatory disease: CNGOF and SPILF Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases Guidelines].,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the procedures for follow-up and counselling of patients after pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).METHODS: A search in the Cochrane database, PubMed, and Google was performed using keywords related to follow-up and PID to identify reports published between 1990 and 2018. All studies published in French and English relevant to the areas of focus were included. A level of evidence (LE) based on the quality of the data available was applied for each area of focus and used for the guidelines.RESULTS: The rate of recurrent PID is 15 to 21%. They are related to a recurrent sexually transmitted infection (STI) in 20 to 34% of cases. Recurrence PID increase the risk of infertility and chronic pelvic pain (LE2). Follow-up is recommended after PID (grade C). The rate of patients lost to follow-up is around 40%. Follow-up is improved by personalized text message reminders (grade B). Vaginal sampling for detection of N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, (and M. genitalium) by nucleic acid amplification techniques is recommended 3 to 6 months after treatment of PID associated with STI to rule out possible reinfections (grade C). The use of condoms after PID associated with STI is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrences (grade C). The systematic use of contraceptive pills after PID is not recommended to prevent subsequent infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Vaginal sampling for microbiological diagnosis is recommended before the insertion of an intrauterine device (grade B). The risk of ectopic pregnancy is high in these women and must be kept in mind.CONCLUSION: Patient counselling and microbiological testing after PID decrease the risk of STI and thus the recurrence of PID.","['Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Condoms', 'Contraception', 'Counseling', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female', 'Mycoplasma genitalium', 'Neisseria gonorrhoeae', 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Vagina']",30878686,"[['B03.440.190.190.190.750'], ['E07.190.270.150'], ['E02.875.194'], ['F02.784.176', 'F04.408.413', 'N02.421.143.303', 'N02.421.461.363'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C13.351.500.365.700'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.553.355'], ['B03.440.400.425.550.550.474', 'B03.660.075.525.520.400'], ['C01.635.500', 'C13.351.500.056.750'], ['C23.888.592.612.944'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C01.221.812', 'C01.778', 'C12.294.668', 'C13.351.500.711', 'C23.550.291.531.937'], ['A05.360.319.779']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
10350,[Experience on the treatment of acute anorectal abscess with primary fistulotomy].,"From August 1985 to July 1989, 72 cases with initial attacks of acute cryptoglandular anorectal abscesses were hospitalized and treated in Kuang Tien General Hospital. Among them were 52 cases of the perianal type, 8 of the intersphincteric type, 11 of the ischiorectal type and one case involving the supralevator space. Included were 62 males and 10 females (sex ratio 6:1) with a mean age of 39 years (range, 18 to 63). The mean duration of the follow-up was 24 months. Most anorectal abscesses originate from a cryptoglandular infection and are usually treated initially by incision and drainage. However, a fistula operation may be required if a fistula develops weeks or months later. Several published papers from various hospitals have also pointed out that this disease condition can be successfully treated by a one-stage operation-primary fistulotomy. In order to determine the source of infection, careful examination was carried out in the operating room under adequate anesthesia. A definite or at least a highly suspected offending crypt was found in 57 cases, all of whom were treated by primary fistulotomy. The remaining 15 cases whose offending crypts were undetectable, were treated by incision and drainage. Of the 57 cases treated with primary fistulotomy, four cases developed recurrent abscesses or fistulas. In the incision and drainage group, five cases developed recurrences.

519,Impact of human immunodeficiency virus infection on the prevalence and severity of steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although steatosis is strongly associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, little is known about this finding in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence and severity of steatosis in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing liver biopsy were prospectively identified and were interviewed to obtain detailed demographic and clinical data. Steatosis was scored according to the percentage of hepatocytes involved: 0 (none), 1 (<33%), 2 (33-66%), or 3 (>66%); fibrosis was scored on a scale from 0 to 4.RESULTS: A total of 708 patients were enrolled, including 154 with HIV/HCV coinfection and 554 with HCV monoinfection. Steatosis of any grade (72.1 vs. 52.0%, P<0.001), grade 2/3 steatosis (48.1 vs. 20.2%, P<0.001), and stage 3/4 fibrosis (43.5 vs. 30.0%, P=0.002) were significantly more common in coinfected patients. Compared to HCV monoinfected subjects, HIV/HCV coinfection was associated with a significantly increased odds of steatosis of any grade (OR=3.21; 95% CI, 1.84-5.60) and grade 2/3 steatosis (OR=5.63; 95% CI, 3.05-10.36) after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Among coinfected patients, the fibrosis progression rate increased in a linear fashion with the grade of steatosis.CONCLUSIONS: Steatosis is more common and more severe in HIV/HCV coinfected patients than in those with HCV monoinfection.","['Fatty Liver', 'Female', 'HIV Infections', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'United States']",16618518,"[['C06.552.241'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['C01.221.250.750.120', 'C01.925.440.440.120', 'C01.925.782.350.350.120', 'C06.552.380.350.120', 'C06.552.380.705.440.120'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.552.630', 'C23.550.355.412'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
48212,Pseudo-rearrangement of the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23: a cautionary note on genotype analysis of leukaemia patients.,"AIMS: The MLL gene on chromosome 11q23 is frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations in association with haematological malignancies. Recently, a specific site within the 8.3 kb MLL break-point cluster region that is cleaved during the early stages of apoptosis has been identified. Because MLL gene rearrangements are used to identify patients with high risk leukaemia, it was the aim of this study to determine whether this DNA cleavage event could be triggered in diagnostic bone marrow samples solely through ex vivo incubation at room temperature.METHODS: Pretreatment bone marrow samples were collected from six paediatric leukaemia patients. Genomic DNA for Southern blot analysis of MLL gene rearrangements was isolated immediately after samples were obtained and compared to genomic DNA isolated after incubation of specimens for 24-60 hours at room temperature, simulating delays in processing that might occur when samples are delivered to reference laboratories. In addition, cryopreserved samples from 70 paediatric leukaemia patients were screened for evidence of site specific MLL cleavage.RESULTS: After ex vivo incubation of bone marrow samples, site specific MLL cleavage resulting in a pseudo-rearrangement of the MLL gene was detected in two of six patients. In addition, a third patient with a similar MLL pseudo-rearrangement in cryopreserved cells was identified.CONCLUSIONS: Pseudo-rearrangement of the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23 was caused by ex vivo incubation of bone marrow samples. This novel phenomenon, which could lead to misclassification of leukaemia patients, might also be of importance for genotype analysis by Southern blotting at other loci.","['Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cryopreservation', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Specimen Handling', 'Transcription Factors', 'Zinc Fingers']",9713591,"[['E05.196.401.114', 'E05.301.300.087', 'E05.601.150'], ['A15.382.216'], ['M01.060.406'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.325.355', 'G05.360.162.520.300.325.355'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.160', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.160', 'E02.792.156', 'E05.200.500.620.760.160', 'E05.200.750.600.760.160', 'E05.760.156'], ['E05.481.500'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G05.344'], ['D08.811.913.555.500.800.200.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['C04.557.337'], ['D12.776.260.560', 'D12.776.624.664.700.148', 'D12.776.930.483'], ['D12.776.624'], ['C04.557.337.428.600', 'C15.604.515.560.600', 'C20.683.515.528.600'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500.791'], ['E01.370.225.998', 'E05.200.998'], ['D12.776.930'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500.985']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
44493,Factors associated with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether menstrual abnormalities, multiple personal behaviors and some contraceptive methods, all of which have been described as potential causes of single episodes of bacterial vaginosis (BV), are associated with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (RBV).STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective, case-controlled study performed in an urban setting. Women with RBV and matched controls were mailed a survey that included multiple questions about potential risk factors for BV. Four-to-one matching of age groups was performed, with 28 RBV cases matched to 112 controls.RESULTS: Among multiple possible predisposing factors, only African American ethnicity (p < 0.001) and > 1 male sex partner in the previous 2 years (p = 0.007) were strongly associated with RBV. Abnormal uterine bleeding, frequent intercourse without a condom or withdrawal, anal intercourse, menstrual hygiene product use, tub baths, back-to-front wiping after using the toilet, smoking, choice of contraceptive method (including condoms, the combination oral contraceptive, injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate or an intrauterine device) and douching were not associated with RBV.CONCLUSION: Providers should counsel women with RBV to minimize their number of male sex partners. There are few data to support the recommendation of other behavioral changes.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Contraception', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Urban Population', 'Vaginosis, Bacterial', 'Young Adult']",20337209,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.686.508.100.100', 'M01.686.754.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E02.875.194'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['F01.145.488'], ['E05.318.308.980.438', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.802'], ['M01.778'], ['N01.600.900'], ['C01.150.252.954', 'C13.351.500.894.906.800'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

A sample of 352 persons, 179 men and 173 women randomly selected from the local community register, age 20-79 years underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. For men age < 50 daytime ambulatory blood pressure (median) was 125/79 mmHg and night time was 106/65 mmHg, for women the respective pressures were 113/77 mmHg and 97/64 mmHg. For men age > or = 50 daytime ambulatory blood pressure was 133/83 mmHg and night time was 124/86 mmHg, for women the respective pressures were 122/83 mmHg and 105/65 mmHg. Presently, we can only relate cardiovascular risk to clinic blood pressure. Therefore we have calculated corresponding ambulatory blood pressure values to WHO's upper limit 160/90 mmHg for normal blood pressure in the clinic and found 154/87 mmHg for daytime and 134/74 mmHg at night. For a clinic pressure of 95 mmHg the corresponding daytime value was 91 mmHg, for 100 mmHg it was 95 mmHg.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reference Values']",8999617,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.370.140.100', 'E01.370.520.500.100'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['Z01.542.816.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.978.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
11017,Relationship between corneal dellen and tearfilm breakup time.,"The BUT of 51 strabismus patients were measured before and after operation. The average pre-op BUT was 28.75 seconds (10.96""-91.80""). The post-op BUT in all operated eyes were reduced significantly, no matter what procedures had been performed and whether dellen appeared or not (P < 0.01). The BUT in the group complicated dellen reduced from 23.22"" (pre-op) to 8.61"" (post-op). The incidence of dellen was 22.54% in this study. The incidence of dellen after rectus resection procedure (47.75%) was much higher than that after rectus recession (5.13%) (P < 0.01). This study showed that dellen was closely related to the BUT and occurred more often in the eyes on which resection procedure was performed. It is considered that excessive lacrimation and elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva near the limbus may disturb the stability of the precornea tearfilm and cause the tearfilm break up earlier. Local corneal dehydration and dellen formation may be caused by reduced BUT. The incidence of dellen after operation may be higher if the cornea was carefully observed.","['Corneal Diseases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Strabismus', 'Tears', 'Time Factors']",1843130,"[['C11.204'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.767'], ['C10.292.562.887', 'C11.590.810'], ['A12.200.882'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In this study, the effect of three galanin antagonists were tested on the pressor response to an intravenous dose (6.3 nmol/kg) of porcine galanin in anaesthetised Cane toads, Bufo marinus. Antagonists were injected at either 20 or 50 times the molar dose (x MD) of galanin. The antagonist, C7 (Galanin 1-13-spantide) reduced the pressor effect of galanin by 32.2 +/- 6.0% when delivered at 20 x MD (n = 4) and by 42.9 +/- 15.7% when delivered at 50 x MD (n = 4) of galanin, the response recovering within 30 min. A second antagonist, M32a (Galanin 1-13-NPY 24-36) had no effect on the pressor response to galanin at 20 x MD (n = 4), but significantly reduced the pressor effect by 54.8 +/- 6.4% at 50 x MD (n = 5), which also recovered within 30 min. Administration of a third antagonist, galantide or M15 (Galanin 1-13-Substance P5-11), resulted in a profound drop in blood pressure, and did not affect the response to galanin at either dose.

1737,Risk factors in community-acquired chronic hepatitis C virus infection: a case-control study in Italy.,"AIMS/METHODS: A case-control study was carried out in Italy to assess the risk factors associated with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Five hundred consecutive chronic anti-hepatitis C virus positive cases and 500 sex and exactly age-matched anti-hepatitis C virus negative/HBsAg negative controls entered the study. Information was collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The adjusted Odds Ratios linking hepatitis C virus infection and risk factors were estimated by conditional multiple logistic regression. Demographic and socio-economic characteristics were similar in cases and controls. Seventy-five percent of patients were aged over 40: males were prominent in the group < or = 40, while the number of females increased with age.RESULTS: As expected, drug addiction and blood transfusion emerged as independent risk factors: blood transfusion in all ages and in both sexes, drug addiction only in subjects under 41 years and mostly in males. Other risk factors independently associated with hepatitis C virus infection were: previous use of non-disposable needles, previous tuberculosis, and prolonged hospitalization before 1970. A history of sexually-transmitted diseases was not associated.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the great spread of hepatitis C virus in Italy may have occurred several years ago through parenteral routes which are not now operating. Modern hygienic and sanitation measures have significantly controlled exposure to the infection, which in the younger generations is confined to high-risk groups such as drug addicts.","['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Female', 'Hepatitis C', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution']",8907564,"[['M01.060.116'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['C01.234'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.542.489'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['I01.240.800', 'N01.224.803', 'N06.850.505.400.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
1469,Spinal 2-chloroprocaine: a comparison with procaine in volunteers.,"Recent studies using preservative-free 2-chloroprocaine (2-CP) for spinal anesthesia have shown it to be a reliable short-acting drug that provides similar anesthesia to lidocaine. In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we compared the characteristics of spinal 2-CP (30 mg) with those of procaine (80 mg) in eight volunteers to determine whether either drug produces spinal anesthetic characteristics ideal for outpatient surgery. By using sensation to pinprick, transcutaneous electrical stimulation, tolerance to thigh tourniquet, and motor blockade as surrogates for surgical efficacy, 2-CP compared similarly to procaine. Peak block height (T9 [range, T6 to T12] versus T6 [T4 to T8]; P = 0.0796), time to two-segment regression (51 +/- 17 min versus 53 +/- 10 min; P = 0.7434), tourniquet time tolerance (37 +/- 16 versus 49 min +/- 17 min; P = 0.1755), and time to return of motor strength (Bromage scale: 54 +/- 23 min versus 55 +/- 44 min, P = 0.9366; return of 90% quadriceps strength: 78 +/- 9 min versus 98 +/- 30 min; P = 0.0721) were all similar. Procaine did produce overall longer sensory blockade (P = 0.0011) and motor blockade at the gastrocnemius (P = 0.0004) and quadriceps (P = 0.0146) muscles. Times until the resolution of sensory blockade (103 +/- 12 min versus 151 +/- 26 min; P = 0.0003), ambulation (103 +/- 12 min versus 151 +/- 26 min; P = 0.0003), and micturition (103 +/- 12 min versus 156 +/- 23 min; P < 0.0001) were all prolonged after procaine. In conclusion, at the doses tested, spinal 2-CP (30 mg) may be a better choice for short outpatient procedures because it provides anesthesia with similar efficacy as procaine (80 mg) but with more rapid fulfillment of discharge criteria.","['Adult', 'Anesthesia, Spinal', 'Anesthetics, Local', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Oximetry', 'Pain Measurement', 'Procaine', 'Prospective Studies', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Bladder']",15673896,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E03.155.086.331'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E05.723.402'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G11.427.494.472'], ['G11.427.494'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.100.600', 'E01.370.370.380.600', 'E01.370.386.700.100.600', 'E05.200.124.100.100.600'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['D02.241.223.100.050.500.906', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.020.937.906'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E01.370.350.850'], ['A05.810.890']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
12987,New mutation of the myelin P0 gene in a pedigree of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy 1.,"P0, the major structural protein of peripheral myelin, is a homophilic adhesion molecule with a single immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, which contains a single N-linked glycosylation site and two cysteines. We have previously reported four different mutations of the myelin P0 gene in four families of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1 (CMT1). In this study we found a new mutation of the myelin P0 gene in a small family of CMT1. The affected persons had an A - to - G substitution of nucleotide 245 of the myelin P0 gene in one allele, leading to a cysteine substitution for tyrosine82 in the extracellular Ig-domain. An additional cysteine in the extracellular domain may form a disulfide bond and cause an inappropriate change in the tertiary structure of the functional Ig-domain of P0.","['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myelin P0 Protein', 'Myelin Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",7505151,"[['M01.060.057'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.250', 'D12.776.543.550.200.250', 'D23.050.301.350.250'], ['C10.500.300.200', 'C10.574.500.495.200', 'C10.668.829.800.300.200', 'C16.131.666.300.200', 'C16.320.400.375.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.250.500', 'D12.776.395.570', 'D12.776.543.550.200.250.500', 'D12.776.543.620.570', 'D12.776.631.580.550', 'D23.050.301.350.250.500'], ['D12.776.543.620', 'D12.776.631.580'], ['E05.393.620.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
44814,Outside-in signaling from integrin alpha IIb beta 3 into platelets in the absence of agonist-induced signaling.,"Platelet agonists generate intracellular signals which lead to activation of the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (integrin alpha IIb beta 3). The resulting occupancy of alpha IIb beta 3 by ligands also generates signals into the cell (outside-in signaling). We reported previously that unlike platelet agonists, the F(ab')2 fragments of an anti-alpha IIb beta 3 monoclonal antibody, PMA4, induced fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3 without causing intracellular activation. In this study, in order to determine whether outside-in signaling occurs in the absence of agonist-induced intracellular signals, we used PMA4 F(ab')2 as an inducer of fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3. PMA4 F(ab')2-induced fibrinogen binding and subsequent platelet aggregation triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including pp72syk but not pp125FAK. No Ca2+ influx or mobilization, thromboxane B2 synthesis, phosphorylation of pleckstrin or the myosin light chain, cytoplasmic alkalinization, or platelet shape changes, were detected. These findings suggest that, in the absence of agonist-induced signaling, alpha IIb beta 3 occupied by soluble fibrinogen generates only a limited outside-in signal.","['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blood Platelets', 'Calcium', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Enzyme Precursors', 'Fibrinogen', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tyrosine']",9195778,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['A11.118.188', 'A15.145.229.188'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D12.776.395.550.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200', 'D23.050.301.350'], ['D08.622', 'D12.776.811.243'], ['D12.776.124.050.250', 'D12.776.124.125.500', 'D12.776.811.300', 'D23.119.490'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.049.500', 'D12.776.744.493'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.049', 'D12.644.360.287', 'D12.776.476.287'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.541.500.650', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650'], ['D12.644.360', 'D12.776.476'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G09.188.390.600'], ['D12.776.395.550.625.785', 'D12.776.543.550.625.785', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.460.700', 'D12.776.543.750.705.675.784'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.650', 'D12.644.360.900', 'D12.776.476.913'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.825.810', 'D10.251.355.310.166.971.810'], ['D12.125.072.050.875']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
22318,A microfluidic platform for pharmaceutical salt screening.,"We describe a microfluidic platform comprised of 48 wells to screen for pharmaceutical salts. Solutions of pharmaceutical parent compounds (PCs) and salt formers (SFs) are mixed on-chip in a combinatorial fashion in arrays of 87.5-nanolitre wells, which constitutes a drastic reduction of the volume of PC solution needed per condition screened compared to typical high throughput pharmaceutical screening approaches. Nucleation and growth of salt crystals is induced by diffusive and/or convective mixing of solutions containing, respectively, PCs and SFs in a variety of solvents. To enable long term experiments, solvent loss was minimized by reducing the thickness of the absorptive polymeric material, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and by using solvent impermeable top and bottom layers. Additionally, well isolation was enhanced via the incorporation of pneumatic valves that are closed at rest. Brightfield and polarized light microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used for on-chip analysis and crystal identification. Using a gold-coated glass substrate and minimizing the thickness of the PDMS control layer drastically improved the signal-to-noise ratio for Raman spectra. Two drugs, naproxen (acid) and ephedrine (base), were used for validation of the platform's ability to screen for salts. Each PC was mixed combinatorially with potential SFs in a variety of solvents. Crystals were visualized using brightfield polarized light microscopy. Subsequent on-chip analyses of the crystals with Raman spectroscopy identified four different naproxen salts and five different ephedrine salts.","['Dimethylpolysiloxanes', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Ephedrine', 'Equipment Design', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Naproxen', 'Optical Phenomena', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Salts', 'Solvents', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman']",21956673,"[['D02.756.650.700.150', 'D05.750.900.850.150', 'D25.720.900.850.150', 'J01.637.051.720.900.850.150'], ['E05.290.750', 'E05.337.550'], ['D02.033.100.624.302', 'D02.033.755.624.302', 'D02.092.063.624.302', 'D02.092.471.683.430'], ['E05.320'], ['E05.588.465'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.638.472.500', 'D04.615.638.472.450'], ['G01.590'], ['D26'], ['D01.786'], ['D27.720.844'], ['E05.196.822.860', 'E05.196.867.890']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
29077,The role of hyaluronan in mesothelium-induced motility of ovarian carcinoma cells.,"BACKGROUND: Ovarian carcinoma metastases occur when the malignant cells establish new colonies on the peritoneal surface. This study was undertaken to determine whether mesothelial cell hyaluronan affects tumor cell motility.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four ovarian carcinoma cell lines (UCI 101, UCI 107, OC 222 and NIH:OVCAR-3) were allowed to migrate toward cultures of mesothelial cells and different concentrations of hyaluronan. Mesothelial hyaluronan production in the presence of the ovarian carcinoma cells was assayed.RESULTS: The carcinoma lines showed greater motility toward mesothelial cells than controls, but the increased motility was abolished by hyaluronidase. Co-cultures of mesothelial cells and ovarian carcinoma cell lines produced up to twice as much hyaluronan as mesothelial cells alone. Purified hyaluronan induced dose-dependent and chemotactic motility in all carcinoma lines.CONCLUSION: These results are evidence that mesothelial hyaluronan is a potential paracrine motility factor for ovarian carcinoma. The presence of mesothelial cells on the peritoneal cavity may encourage the establishment of ovarian carcinoma metastases.","['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemotaxis', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronic Acid', 'Hyaluronoglucosaminidase', 'Ovarian Neoplasms']",14666707,"[['G04.022'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['F01.145.113.780.500', 'F01.145.875.439.500.500', 'G04.198.424', 'G07.568.500.590.500', 'G11.427.410.568.850.500'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['A11.436'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D09.698.373.475'], ['D08.811.277.450.529', 'D08.811.520.241.700.675'], ['C04.588.322.455', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705', 'C13.351.937.418.685', 'C19.344.410', 'C19.391.630.705']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41328,Effects of thyroid hormone on GLUT4 glucose transporter gene expression and NIDDM in rats.,"Previous studies have shown that T3 coordinately stimulates GLUT4-glucose transporter messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in mixed fiber-type skeletal muscle of the rat and produces a concomitant elevation in basal (noninsulin mediated) glucose uptake. The aim of the present study was to 1) determine the precise mechanism(s) for the T3-induced expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, and 2) investigate the potential benefits of T3 on noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Ten daily ip injections of T3 (100 micrograms/100 g BW) administered to hypothyroid male Sprague-Dawley rats, increased both GLUT4 mRNA and transcription approximately 70% (P < 0.05) in mixed fiber-type hindlimb skeletal muscle. Transcriptional induction was subsequently defined to be restricted to red (oxidative) muscle fibers (2.5-fold; P < 0.05), whereas GLUT4 protein was increased in both red and white (glycolytic) skeletal muscle. GLUT4 mRNA and protein expression were similarly inducible in the skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant Zucker rats. More importantly, T3 treatment totally ameliorated hyperinsulinemia in obese animals (P < 0.001), although their moderately elevated plasma glucose levels were not significantly altered. In conclusion, regulation of GLUT4 expression by T3 was shown to lie at the transcriptional level in red skeletal muscle, whereas in white muscle fiber types, it appears to operate via an alternative posttranscriptional mechanism. These data also support the potential of hormonally inducing glucose transporter expression in insulin-resistant muscle. However, high levels of T3 are associated with a number of adverse side-effects, in particular the stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Nevertheless, future studies may demonstrate, e.g. subthyrotoxic levels, to be similarly effective but without side effects, and thus perhaps find a clinical application in reducing both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in NIDDM.","['Animals', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Gene Expression', 'Glucose Transporter Type 4', 'Hindlimb', 'Hyperinsulinism', 'Male', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Obesity', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rats, Zucker', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Triiodothyronine']",9048628,"[['B01.050'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['G05.297'], ['D12.776.157.530.500.500.937', 'D12.776.157.530.937.563.937', 'D12.776.543.585.500.500.937', 'D12.776.543.585.937.625.937'], ['A13.473'], ['C18.452.394.968'], ['D12.776.157.530.500', 'D12.776.543.585.500'], ['A10.690.552.500.500', 'A11.620.249'], ['D12.776.210.500'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.550.700'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D06.472.931.740.385', 'D12.125.072.050.767.741.894']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15373,Intravenous magnesium sulfate for the treatment of acute asthma in the emergency department.,"Conventional nebulized beta-agonist therapy has met with disappointing results in an increasing number of moderate to severe asthmatics who may be characterized as ""poor responders."" Thirty-eight patients suffering from acute exacerbations of moderate to severe asthma were treated in an emergency department with an intravenous infusion of saline placebo or 1.2 g of magnesium sulfate after conventional beta-agonist therapy failed to produce significant improvement in peak expiratory flow rate. Nineteen patients were randomized into each of two groups in a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.

28099,A novel fiber composite ingredient incorporated into a beverage and bar blunts postprandial serum glucose and insulin responses: a randomized controlled trial.,"Previous research supports that consumption of resistant starch and guar gum independently influences insulin-mediated glucose responses to meals. This research assessed a novel co-processed fiber composite (FC) ingredient comprising whole-grain high-amylose maize flour and viscous guar gum on glucose and insulin responses to co-consumed and subsequent meals in humans. It was hypothesized that a smoothie-type beverage or a cold-pressed snack bar containing the FC would blunt and sustain serum glucose and insulin postprandial responses compared with maltodextrin (MD). The beverage and bar were assessed in 2 separate studies using identical protocols. Young, nondiabetic, nonobese adults participated in 2 testing days (randomized crossover design) separated by at least 1 week for both food forms. On each testing day, the FC or MD product was consumed with a low-fiber standardized breakfast followed by a low-fiber standardized lunch (with no FC or MD) 4 hours later. Blood samples were collected at baseline and incrementally throughout the 8-hour testing day. One-tailed paired t tests were performed to compare treatment areas under the curve, and a doubly repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to compare treatment responses at individual time points (P< .05, Bonferroni corrected). The FC blunted the postprandial glucose and insulin responses compared with MD, including a robust glucose and insulin response reduction after breakfast and a continued modest glycemic second-meal reduction after lunch in both the beverage and the bar. These findings support the use of this novel whole-grain FC ingredient in a beverage or bar for insulin-mediated glucose control in young healthy adults.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amylose', 'Beverages', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Flour', 'Galactans', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Male', 'Mannans', 'Meals', 'Plant Gums', 'Polysaccharides', 'Postprandial Period', 'Whole Grains', 'Young Adult', 'Zea mays']",26923512,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D09.301.915.361', 'D09.698.365.855.361'], ['G07.203.100', 'J02.200'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['D09.301.416', 'G07.203.300.400', 'J02.500.400'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['G07.203.300.484', 'J02.500.484'], ['D09.698.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['D09.698.550'], ['G07.203.300.590', 'J02.500.590'], ['D05.750.078.739', 'D09.698.700', 'D20.215.721.249'], ['D09.698'], ['G10.261.700'], ['G07.203.300.300.550.500', 'G07.203.300.775.500.500', 'J02.500.300.550.500', 'J02.500.775.500.500'], ['M01.060.116.815'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.966']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

These sequences are regulated in a cell-specific manner. (i) In NIH 3T3 cells, the CArG box of the c-fos promoter is sufficient to mediate activation by oncogenes. (ii) In contrast, in HeLa cells, additional flanking sequences are also required, including the outer arm of the serum response element and the FAP site. We also show that the serum response factor, which binds to the CArG box, activates transcription in vivo in NIH 3T3 cells but not in HeLa cells.

3081,A naturally occurring gamma globin gene mutation enhances SP1 binding activity.,"Transcription of the human fetal globin genes in erythroid cells is tightly regulated during different stages of development and differentiation. Two naturally occurring mutations 202 base pairs upstream of the duplicated gamma globin genes are associated with incorrectly regulated gamma globin gene gene expression; elevated levels of fetal globin are synthesized during adult life. A C-to-G base substitution upstream of the G gamma-globin gene is highly correlated with a dramatic increase in gene expression. It increases the similarity of the region to the consensus Sp1 recognition site. We determined that the mutated DNA had a 5- to 10-fold-higher affinity for Sp1 than did normal gamma globin gene sequence. We also observed a reduction in normal factor-binding activity. A different substitution at -202, C to T, upstream of the A gamma-globin gene was associated with a more moderate increase in fetal globin expression. This mutation decreased the similarity of the sequence to an Sp1 recognition site. We determined that it did not result in enhanced Sp1 binding but did alter normal factor binding. We suggest that these changes in nuclear protein-binding properties detected in vitro are responsible for the enhanced gamma globin gene expression found in -202 G gamma beta + patients with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.","['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian virus 40', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1688466,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['D12.776.260'], ['D12.776.124.400.303', 'D12.776.422.316.762.320'], ['G05.308'], ['D12.776.422.316'], ['C15.378.420', 'C16.320.365'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D13.444.600.601', 'D27.505.259.750.600.650', 'D27.720.470.530.600.650'], ['G02.111.570.080.689', 'G05.360.080.689'], ['B04.280.210.700.615.700', 'B04.613.204.670.615.700'], ['D12.776.260.522.750.249', 'D12.776.930.375.750.249'], ['D12.776.930'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

12297,Mutational analysis of bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase: role of motif IV in ligation catalysis.,"The bacterial DNA ligase as a multiple domain protein is involved in DNA replication, repair and recombination. Its catalysis of ligation can be divided into three steps. To delineate the roles of amino acid residues in motif IV in ligation catalysis, site-directed mutants were constructed in a bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase from Thermus sp. TAK16D. It was shown that four conserved residues (D286, G287, V289 and K291) in motif IV had significant roles on the overall ligation. Under single turnover conditions, the observed apparent rates of D286E, G287A, V289I and K291R mutants were clearly reduced compared with that of WT ligase on both match and mismatch nicked substrates. The effects of D286E mutation on overall ligation may not only be ascribed to the third step. The G287A mutation has a major effect on the second step. The effects of V289I and K291R mutation on overall ligation are not on the third step, perhaps other aspects, such as conformation change of ligase protein in ligation catalysis, are involved. Moreover, the amino acid substitutions of above four residues were more sensitive on mismatch nicked substrate, indicating an enhanced ligation fidelity.","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Pair Mismatch', 'Base Sequence', 'Catalysis', 'DNA Ligases', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli', 'Kinetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thermus', 'Transformation, Genetic']",17687496,"[['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500', 'G02.111.570.820.709.600.500'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G05.365.590.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.130'], ['D08.811.074.500', 'D08.811.464.754.600'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['G02.111.835'], ['B03.440.400.425.875'], ['G05.728.865']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
3516,Mental action simulation synchronizes action-observation circuits across individuals.,"A frontoparietal action-observation network (AON) has been proposed to support understanding others' actions and goals. We show that the AON ""ticks together"" in human subjects who are sharing a third person's feelings. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 20 volunteers watched movies depicting boxing matches passively or while simulating a prespecified boxer's feelings. Instantaneous intersubject phase synchronization (ISPS) was computed to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity of hemodynamic activity and inter-area functional connectivity. During passive viewing, subjects' brain activity was synchronized in sensory projection and posterior temporal cortices. Simulation induced widespread increase of ISPS in the AON (premotor, posterior parietal, and superior temporal cortices), primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, and the dorsal attention circuits (frontal eye fields, intraparietal sulcus). Moreover, interconnectivity of these regions strengthened during simulation. We propose that sharing a third person's feelings synchronizes the observer's own brain mechanisms supporting sensations and motor planning, thereby likely promoting mutual understanding.","['Adult', 'Brain', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Individuality', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mental Processes', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Net', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Young Adult']",24431433,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A08.186.211'], ['F01.470'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.488'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['F02.463'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A08.511'], ['E05.318.372.250.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.500'], ['E05.723.729'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
41833,"Divergence in nonspecific hydrophobic packing interactions in the apo state, and its possible role in functional specialization of mitochondrial and microsomal cytochrome b5.","The outer mitochondrial membrane isoform of mammalian cytochrome b(5) (OM b(5)) is distinguished from the microsomal isoform (Mc b(5)) by its considerably greater stability. In contrast, OM and Mc apocytochrome b(5) (apo-b(5)) exhibit similar thermodynamic stability. Contributing substantially to the greater stability of OM b(5) relative to that of Mc b(5) is the presence of Leu at position 71. Replacing Leu-71 in OM b(5) with the corresponding Mc b(5) residue (Ser) not only diminishes holoprotein stability but also markedly compromises apoprotein stability. The studies reported herein were undertaken to clarify the role played by Leu-71 in stabilizing OM b(5)s relative to Mc b(5)s, and were motivated by the possibility that stability is related to other differences in OM and Mc b(5) properties that are important for their specialized subcellular roles. The results of these studies show that Leu-71 plays an essential role in maintaining the structural integrity of the heme-independent folding core of OM apo-b(5) (core 2), despite its location in the disordered empty heme-binding pocket (core 1). The conformational integrity of core 2 in Mc apo-b(5)s is not similarly dependent on the presence of a hydrophobic residue at position 71, providing new evidence for evolution of compensating structural features not present in OM b(5)s. We propose that Leu-71 achieves its effect on OM apo-b(5) core 2 structure by participating in a nonspecific hydrophobic collapse of disordered core 1, templated by more conformationally restricted side chains of residues in the beta-sheet that separates the two cores. We hypothesize that this has the added effect of maintaining core 1 of OM apo-b(5)s in a state more compact than that which occurs in Mc apo-b(5)s, possibly contributing to stronger heme binding by limiting the number of non-native conformations that the empty heme-binding pocket can populate.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Cytochromes b5', 'Microsomes', 'Mitochondria', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment']",16262260,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.196.309.742.225'], ['D08.244.187.500', 'D12.776.422.220.187.500'], ['A11.284.835.540'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G01.154.651.750.500', 'G02.111.688.750.500'], ['D12.776.800'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.600'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.776.828'], ['E05.393.751']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
14110,Adolescent bisphenol-A exposure decreases dendritic spine density: role of sex and age.,"Bisphenol-A (BPA), a common environmental endocrine disruptor, modulates estrogenic, androgenic, and antiandrogenic effects throughout the lifespan. We recently showed that low dose BPA exposure during adolescence increases anxiety and impairs spatial memory independent of sex. In this study, six week old Sprague Dawley rats (n=24 males, n=24 females) received daily subcutaneous injections (40 µg/kg bodyweight) of BPA or vehicle for one week. Serum corticosterone levels in response to a 1 h restraint stress and spine density were examined at age 7 (cohort 1) and 11 (cohort 2) weeks. Adolescent BPA exposure did not alter stress dependent corticosterone responses but decreased spine density on apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal CA1 region (CA1). Sex differences in spine density were observed on basal dendrites of the mPFC and CA1 with females having greater spine density than males. This sex difference was further augmented by both age and treatment, with results indicating that BPA-dependent decreases in spine density were more pronounced in males than females on mPFC basal dendrites. Importantly, the robust neuronal alterations were observed in animals exposed to BPA levels below the current U.S.E.P.A. recommended safe daily limit. These results are the first demonstrating that BPA given during adolescence leads to enduring effects on neural morphology at adulthood. Given that humans are routinely exposed to low levels of BPA through a variety of sources, the decreased spine density reported in both male and female rats after BPA exposure warrants further investigation.","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Benzhydryl Compounds', 'CA1 Region, Hippocampal', 'Corticosterone', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Female', 'Male', 'Phenols', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sex Factors']",24975924,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.115'], ['A08.186.211.180.405.099', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.345.099'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.237', 'D06.472.040.585.353.237'], ['A08.675.256.200', 'A11.284.180.225.169', 'A11.671.240.169'], ['D27.505.696.353', 'D27.888.141'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270.700'], ['A08.675.790', 'A11.671.790'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
21054,Validity and reliability of a quality-of-life instrument: the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire.,"A pilot study was done to evaluate criterion-related validity and test-retest reliability of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ examines how chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) effects quality of life, and evaluates four dimensions: dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, and mastery. The pilot study did not establish validity. One of the dimensions, mastery, did not correlate with any of the criterion instruments. Reliability was demonstrated when the instrument was retested after 9 days. The recommendation, based on this research, is that the CRQ may be useful in clinical settings, but not for research.","['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internal-External Control', 'Lung Diseases, Obstructive', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",8173519,"[['E02.760.169.063.500.067', 'E02.831.067', 'I03.050', 'N02.421.784.110'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.379'], ['C08.381.495'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

The data represent a valuable baseline from which to assess the effects of the environmental factors in the deep-underground on human physiology, psychology, and pathology.The air pressure, relative humidity, temperature, total ã radiation dose-rate, and oxygen concentration in the CJEM in the aisles in goafs at 4 depths below ground were measured. Study subjects were administered a study-specific questionnaire that included items that targeted factors with potential to affect respondents' health and wellbeing and included the symptom checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R).Air pressure, relative humidity, and temperature rose, total ã radiation dose-rate decreased, and there was no change in oxygen concentration with increasing depth below ground. Most (97.2%) respondents had a negative impression of the ambient conditions in the deep-underground space. The most commonly perceived adverse factors included moisture (74.9%), heat (33.5%), and poor ventilation (32.4%). 93.29% of respondents associated ?1 self-reported negative physical symptom with working in the deep-underground space; the most frequent symptoms were being easily tired (48.7%), tinnitus (47.5%), and hearing loss (44.1%).

We randomly sampled 12,000 veterans with heart failure diagnosed in 2010. The topic modeling method was applied to identify frailty-related topics from the clinical notes in the electronic medical records. The frailty topics were classified into five deficit areas including physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), general health (GH), social functioning (SF), and mental health (MH). We experimented with different covariates and four different frailty measures: individual frailty topics, number of distinct frailty topics, a dichotomous deficit category, and the number of distinct deficits, respectively. A total of 8,531 (71.1%) patients had at least one frailty topic. The prevalence of GH, PF, MH, SF, and RP deficits were 89.0%, 61.3%, 56.9%, 40.6%, and 9.5%, respectively. PF deficits (yes/no) and the number of distinct deficits were the most consistent, significant predictors of adverse outcomes of rehosptalization or death.","['Aged', 'Frail Elderly', 'Frailty', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Heart Failure', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Prevalence']",29295109,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.540'], ['C23.550.359'], ['E05.318.308.225', 'I01.240.425.350', 'N01.224.425.350', 'N05.715.360.300.360', 'N06.850.505.400.425.350', 'N06.850.520.308.225'], ['C14.280.434'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.418', 'N01.400.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
22337,Uric Acid Levels Correlate with Sensory Nerve Function in Healthy Subjects.,"BACKGROUND: High levels of uric acid (UA) are associated with various peripheral neuropathies. Furthermore, uric acid levels have been found to correlate with both the clinical and electrophysiological severity of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy, mainly with sensory functions.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether higher UA levels are associated negatively with nerve function in healthy subjects.METHODS: A total of 126 healthy subjects recruited prospectively for another study were included. We extracted demographic data, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score (TCNS), electrophysiological findings, vibration perception thresholds (VPT), and laboratory test results including UA, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and lipid levels.RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 56 ± 17 years with 56% females. Males had higher UA values compared with females. Univariate beta regression coefficient analysis between UA levels and demographic, clinical, electrophysiological, and laboratory findings showed significant positive correlations with male gender, components of the metabolic syndrome, and with VPT, while an inverse correlation was found with electrophysiological sensory parameters. A multivariate regression model showed positive correlations only with BMI, finger VPT, and triglycerides.CONCLUSION: Higher UA levels correlate with lower sensory nerve function in healthy subjects, expanding the evidence of possible negative influence of UA on peripheral nerves, although a causative role has not yet established.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Sensation', 'Sensory Thresholds', 'Uric Acid']",30880660,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.774.500', 'M01.955.236'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A08.800.800'], ['F02.830.816', 'G11.561.790'], ['F02.463.593.710'], ['D03.132.960.877', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824.877']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
6191,Cost-utility analysis comparing meropenem with imipenem plus cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in intensive care.,"This study compared the cost-effectiveness of meropenem with that of imipenem plus cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in hospital intensive care in the UK. A Markov model was constructed to model lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of using meropenem and imipenem plus cilastatin for the treatment of severe infections in intensive care. Estimates of effectiveness, utility weights and costs were obtained from the published literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Estimated treatment costs for the patient cohort were pound 14,938 with meropenem and pound 15,585 with imipenem plus cilastatin. QALYs gained were 7,495 with meropenem and 7,413 with imipenem plus cilastatin. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed meropenem to be significantly less costly (-pound 636.47, 95% CI -pound 132.33 to -pound 1,140.62) and more effective (0.084, 95% CI 0.023 to 0.144).

15707,Bridging across length scales: multi-scale ordering of supported lipid bilayers via lipoprotein self-assembly and surface patterning.,"We show that a two-step process, involving spontaneous self-assembly of lipids and apolipoproteins and surface patterning, produces single, supported lipid bilayers over two discrete and independently adjustable length scales. Specifically, an aqueous phase incubation of DMPC vesicles with purified apolipoprotein A-I results in the reconstitution of high density lipoprotein (rHDL), wherein nanoscale clusters of single lipid bilayers are corralled by the protein. Adsorption of these discoidal particles to clean hydrophilic glass (or silicon) followed by direct exposure to a spatial pattern of short-wavelength UV radiation directly produces microscopic patterns of nanostructured bilayers. Alternatively, simple incubation of aqueous phase rHDL with a chemically patterned hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface produces a novel compositional pattern, caused by an increased affinity for adsorption onto hydrophilic regions relative to the surrounding hydrophobic regions. Further, by simple chemical denaturation of the boundary protein, nanoscale compartmentalization can be selectively erased, thus producing patterns of laterally fluid, lipid bilayers structured solely at the mesoscopic length scale. Since these aqueous phase microarrays of nanostructured lipid bilayers allow for membrane proteins to be embedded within single nanoscale bilayer compartments, they present a viable means of generating high-density membrane protein arrays. Such a system would permit in-depth elucidation of membrane protein structure-function relationships and the consequences of membrane compartmentalization on lipid dynamics.","['Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Lipoproteins', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nanostructures', 'Particle Size', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Surface Properties', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Water']",18642906,"[['D10.570.755.375.760.400.800.200'], ['D10.570.510', 'J01.637.087.500.510'], ['D10.532', 'D12.776.521'], ['E05.599.595'], ['J01.637.512'], ['G02.712'], ['E05.588.570.700', 'E05.601.680'], ['G02.860'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
4809,Implementation of an HACCP model in foot and mouth disease control programmes.,"The organisation and structure of the official Veterinary Services (OVS) are designed to meet a specific aim--the health certification of animal health, welfare and food safety in the production and processing stage. Disease prevention and control calls for programmes and projects that, depending on the characteristics of each disease, may involve any branch of the OVS, from the laboratory to field activities. For the purpose of this work, the model used is that of a country that is 'free from foot and mouth disease with vaccination' in accordance with the conditions stipulated in Chapter 8.8. of the World Organisation for Animal Health Terrestrial Animal Health Code. These conditions state that, to maintain this health status, a programme of monitoring and continuous control of the relevant variables must be implemented. This is achieved by applying good practice and identifying the critical control points in all processes, using a checklist that simplifies the task.

The effect of MRP1 G1666A and GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphisms on blood and urinary arsenic levels were determined in 95 Turkish smelter workers. Blood and urinary arsenic concentrations were measured by GF-AAS with Zeeman correction and gene polymorphisms were investigated by PCR-RFLP method. The mean blood and urinary arsenic levels were 21.60±12.28ìg/L and 5.58±4.37ìg/L, respectively. A significant association between MRP1 1666A allele and urinary arsenic levels was found (p=0.001). GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism was detected not to be associated with either blood or urinary arsenic levels (p=0.384, p=0.440, respectively). Significant association was also detected between MRP1A(-)/GSTP1Val(-) genotypes and urinary arsenic levels (p=0.001). This study suggested that MRP1 G1666A alone and, also, combined with GSTP1 Ile105Val were associated with inter-individual variations in urinary arsenic levels, but not with blood arsenic levels.","['Adult', 'Arsenic', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Humans', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Turkey']",26970057,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D01.268.513.249'], ['D08.811.913.225.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.157.530.100.304', 'D12.776.157.530.450.074.500.500.500', 'D12.776.543.585.100.304', 'D12.776.543.585.450.074.500.500.500'], ['N06.850.460.350.600'], ['G05.365.795'], ['Z01.252.245.500.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
25605,[Positron emission tomography/computed tomography for lung cancer staging].,"BACKGROUND: PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography) is widely used in nodal and metastatic staging of lung cancer patients.AIM: To analyze PET/CT detection of metastatic disease in patients with lung cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively F18Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT scans performed between December 2008 and December 2013. We selected 143 patients aged 30 to 92 years (63% males) with confirmed lung cancer referred for staging, with no previous treatment. We reviewed whole body PET/CT and brain magnetic resonance images. SUVmax (Standardized Uptake Value maximum) of primary pulmonary lesion, hilar/mediastinal nodes, and distant metastases were calculated.RESULTS: Histological types encountered were adenocarcinoma in 55%, squamous-cell in 15%, small-cell in 8%, large-cell in 6% and adeno-squamous in 2%. In 22 cases (15%) histology was not available. Nodal involvement was observed in 60% of patients (44% hilar and 48% mediastinal). Skip metastases (mediastinal involvement without hilum involvement) were encountered in 17% of cases, and were significantly more common among high uptake lung tumors (p < 0.01). Best SUVmax cut-off for node involvement was 4.4 for hilum and 4.0 for mediastinum (sensibility: 86.4%, specificity: 99.8%). Sixty six patients (46.2%) showed distant metastases on PET/CT. The most common metastases were osseous in 22%, adrenal in 16%, hepatic in14%, pulmonary in 14% and cerebral in 12%. PET/CT detected a second unexpected synchronic cancer in eight patients (6%).CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT is accurate for nodal staging using an uptake index as SUVmax. Distant metastases are common, especially in bone, adrenal glands and liver.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Adenosquamous', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",25860265,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.557.435.250', 'C04.557.470.200.150'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['D09.254.229.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.567'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.370.350.350.800.700', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800.399', 'E01.370.350.710.800.399', 'E01.370.350.825.800.399', 'E01.370.384.730.800.399'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['D27.505.259.843', 'D27.505.519.871', 'D27.720.470.410.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
44247,Dynamic gray matter volume changes in pediatric multiple sclerosis: A 3.5 year MRI study.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess, using MRI, the spatial patterns of gray matter (GM) atrophy in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), their dynamic changes over time, and their clinical relevance.METHODS: Sixty-eight pediatric patients with MS (30 with a clinical and MRI follow-up after 3.5 years) and 26 healthy controls (HC) underwent clinical and MRI evaluation. To overcome difficulties in obtaining longitudinal scans in pediatric HC, a group of 317 pediatric HC from an NIH-funded MRI Study of Normal Brain Development was used to estimate GM developmental trajectories. In pediatric patients with MS, deviations from normative GM volume values at the voxel level were assessed at baseline and during the follow-up, using linear mixed-effects models. Correlations between GM volume deviations and disability, IQ, and white matter (WM) lesion volumes (LV) were estimated.RESULTS: Pediatric patients with MS showed failures in GM development in several cortical and subcortical regions, as well as GM atrophy progression in most of these regions, which were only partially related to focal WM LV. Significant correlations were found between regional GM atrophy (particularly of deep GM regions) and disability, whereas higher IQ was associated with reduced deviations from age-expected GM volumes of specific GM regions at baseline and during the follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Impaired GM maturation occurs in pediatric patients with MS, which is only partially driven by WM inflammation, suggesting that early neurodegenerative phenomena contribute to disability. High IQ, a measure of reserve, may offer protection by promoting remodeling of GM pruning in this young age.","['Adolescent', 'Atrophy', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gray Matter', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Young Adult']",30867274,"[['M01.060.057'], ['C23.300.070'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['A08.186.211.168', 'A08.186.854.348'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.711.141.493'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['C10.114.375.500', 'C10.314.350.500', 'C20.111.258.250.500'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Studied were a total of thirty-two dead and slaughtered animals. Bacteriologically, the disease was shown to be caused by types A, D, and C of Clostridium perfringens. Types C and D proved pathogenic for guinea pigs, while type A did not. Isolated was a strain of Clostridium perfringens, which had high toxigenicity. It was found that calves were fairly often affected with the disease. Most severe were the infections caused by type C of Cl. perfringens, with most pronounced morphologic lesions. There were differences in the changes caused by all three types of the organism in calves, which made it possible to distinguish them as causative agents. Type A induced slight icterus and slightly manifested hemosiderosis of the liver, kidneys, and spleen; type D was responsible for severe injury and hyalin dystrophy of the kidneys; and type C caused necrotic enteritis, pronounced hemorrhagic diathesis, degenerative changes in the ganglial cells, and demyelinization of the brain.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases', 'Clostridium Infections', 'Clostridium perfringens', 'Enterotoxins', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Mice']",2876542,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['C22.196'], ['C01.150.252.410.222'], ['B03.300.390.400.200.575', 'B03.353.625.375.500.575', 'B03.510.415.400.200.575'], ['D23.946.330'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18807,Growth rates and life histories in twenty-two small-scale societies.,"This study investigates variation in body growth (cross-sectional height and weight velocity) among a sample of 22 small-scale societies. Considerable variation in growth exists among hunter-gatherers that overlaps heavily with growth trajectories present in groups focusing more on horticulture. Intergroup variation tends to track environmental conditions, with societies under more favorable conditions displaying faster growth and earlier puberty. In addition, faster/earlier development in females is correlated with higher mortality. For example, African ""Pygmies,"" Philippine ""Negritos,"" and the Hiwi of Venezuela are characterized by relatively fast child-juvenile growth for their adult body size (used as a proxy for energetic availability). In these societies, subadult survival is low, and puberty, menarche, and first reproduction are relatively early (given their adult body size), suggesting selective pressure for accelerated development in the face of higher mortality. In sum, the origin and maintenance of different human ontogenies may require explanations invoking both environmental constraints and selective pressures.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Height', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnology', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",16634027,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160.100', 'E05.041.124.160.500', 'G07.100.100.160.100', 'G07.345.249.314.100'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['I01.076.201.450.457'], ['C23.550.393'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

Careful removal of potential ectoparasites and delicate lip or manual placement on leaves followed by intense visual examination characterised this behaviour. It appears to be done to judge whether either ingestion or discarding is most appropriate, the former occurring in most cases. This behaviour may represent a third variant of ectoparasite handling, different from those described at Tai and Gombe, yet sharing features with the latter.

2378,Endoplasmic reticulum stress and glycogen synthase kinase-3â activation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mouse models of accelerated atherosclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling and the contribution of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3â activation in hyperglycemic, hyperhomocysteinemic, and high-fat-fed apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mouse models of accelerated atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS: Female apoE(-/-) mice received multiple low-dose injections of streptozotocin (40 ìg/kg) to induce hyperglycemia, methionine-supplemented drinking water (0.5% wt/vol) to induce hyperhomocysteinemia, or a high-fat (21% milk fat+0.2% cholesterol) diet to induce relative dyslipidemia. A subset of mice from each group was supplemented with sodium valproate (625 mg/kg), a compound with GSK3 inhibitory activity. At 15 and 24 weeks of age, markers of ER stress, lipid accumulation, GSK3â phosphorylation, and GSK3â activity were analyzed in liver and aorta. Atherosclerotic lesions were examined and quantified. Hyperglycemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, and high-fat diet significantly enhanced GSK3â activity and also increased hepatic steatosis and atherosclerotic lesion volume compared with controls. Valproate supplementation blocked GSK3â activation and attenuated the development of atherosclerosis and the accumulation of hepatic lipids in each of the models examined. The mechanism by which GSK3â activity is regulated in these models likely involves alterations in phosphorylation at serine 9 and tyrosine 216.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the existence of a common mechanism of accelerated atherosclerosis involving ER stress signaling through activation of GSK3â. Furthermore, our results suggest that atherosclerosis can be attenuated by modulating GSK3â phosphorylation.","['Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apolipoproteins E', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fatty Liver', 'Female', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperhomocysteinemia', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Liver', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Valproic Acid']",21998135,"[['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114.056'], ['D10.532.091.500', 'D12.776.070.400.500', 'D12.776.521.120.500'], ['C14.907.137.126.307'], ['G07.203.650.240.267'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['G04.434'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['C06.552.241'], ['D05.500.117.875', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.429.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.625', 'D12.644.360.300.500', 'D12.776.476.081.875', 'D12.776.476.300.500'], ['D05.500.117.875.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.429.500.500', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.646.625.500', 'D12.644.360.300.500.500', 'D12.776.476.081.875.500', 'D12.776.476.300.500.500'], ['A11.251.860.180.432', 'A11.436.348.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452.394.952'], ['C16.320.565.100.480', 'C18.452.603.378', 'C18.452.648.100.480', 'C18.654.521.500.133.699.418'], ['G03.458'], ['A03.620'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D02.241.081.944.509.900', 'D10.251.400.895.593.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
39233,Do songbirds in wetlands show higher mercury bioaccumulation relative to conspecifics in non-wetland habitats?,"Environmental conditions in wetlands facilitate favorable biogeochemical conditions for the conversion of inorganic mercury into methylmercury. For this reason, wetlands are increasingly classified as mercury hotspots, places where biota exhibit elevated mercury concentrations. While it is clear that wetlands play an important role in methylmercury production, factors such as geographic variation in mercury deposition, wetland type, and trophic dynamics can cause variation in mercury dynamics and bioaccumulation in biota occupying wetlands or connected to wetland trophic systems. Here, we use songbirds as bioindicators in a two-pronged approach aimed at evaluating the state of our understanding of mercury bioaccumulation by songbirds in wetland ecosystems. First, we use a case study in southeast Missouri to compare blood mercury concentrations in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) occupying wetland and non-wetland habitats to test the hypothesis that songbirds in wetlands will have higher mercury bioaccumulation than those in non-wetlands. Adult tree swallows in wetlands had significantly higher blood mercury concentrations than those in non-wetlands; however, no difference between ecosystems was detected in eastern bluebirds. Second, we present a review of the current literature on mercury in songbirds in wetland ecosystems across North America. Mercury concentrations in songbirds varied among wetland types and with geographic location, often in an unpredictable manner. Mercury concentrations in songbird blood varied 3-10 fold at locations separated only by ~10 to several hundred kilometers. This magnitude of difference in blood mercury concentrations among wetlands exceeds documented differences between wetland and non-wetland ecosystems. Therefore, we caution against the automatic assumption that songbirds occupying wetlands will have higher mercury bioaccumulation than conspecifics living in other habitats.","['Animals', 'Ecosystem', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Food Chain', 'Mercury', 'Songbirds', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Wetlands']",31942663,"[['B01.050'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['G16.500.275.157.250', 'N06.230.124.250'], ['D01.268.556.504', 'D01.268.956.437', 'D01.552.544.504'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.620.750'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['G16.500.275.157.812', 'N06.230.124.625']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
2557,Nonisotopic single strand conformation analysis of the 5 alpha-reductase type 2 gene for the diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency.,"5 alpha-Reductase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of defective virilization in karyotypic males due to reduced conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. The gene encoding the affected 5 alpha-reductase type 2 enzyme has recently been cloned, and mutations within the coding region have been discovered as the cause of this disease. We address the possibility of a rapid nonradioactive molecular genetic screening technique for initial diagnosis and report different point mutations in this gene in eight unrelated patients with clinical features of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. For molecular genetic analysis, DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes was studied. The coding region of the 5 alpha-reductase type 2 gene was characterized by exon-specific PCR amplification, nonradioactive single strand conformation analysis, and direct sequencing. In seven patients, homozygous point mutations were identified (Leu55-Gln, delta Met157, Gly196-Ser, Arg227-Gln, Ala228-Thr, and His231-Arg). One individual was a compound heterozygote carrier of two mutations (Ile112-Asn and Gln126-Arg). We conclude that molecular genetic characterization of point mutations in the 5 alpha-reductase type 2 gene may be used as an additional valuable procedure for the diagnosis of this disorder.","['3-Oxo-5-alpha-Steroid 4-Dehydrogenase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Consanguinity', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukocytes', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",8784107,"[['D08.811.682.660.465'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.090.403.180', 'G05.180'], ['D13.444.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['A11.118.637', 'A15.145.229.637', 'A15.382.490'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['G05.365.795.600']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
41482,Quantification of morphologic and hemodynamic severity of coarctation of the aorta by magnetic resonance imaging.,"OBJECTIVE: As the morpholgic severity of coarctation of the aorta is difficult to assess, especially after previous repair, the value of the technique of multiplanar reconstruction of magnetic resonance imaging data to achieve a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the aortic arch was evaluated and compared to hemodynamic measurements.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed 30 examinations in 27 patients aged from 6 to 54 years, with a mean of 21 years, by magnetic resonance imaging using a 1.5Tesla scanner with a standard body coil. Measurements of flow across the coarctation were performed using phase shift velocity mapping, and peak velocity was calculated at the site of stenosis. Aortic cross-sectional area before, at, and beyond the stenosis was reconstructed 3-dimensionally to calculate a percentage degree of stenosis. Morphologic severity of stenosis was correlated to invasively assessed hemodynamic gradients and morphologic data from biplane angiography in 23 patients. Among the 30 examinations, 24 patients had been previously treated by either surgery, in 17 patients, or balloon dilation, while 6 had native coarctation. 3-dimensional reconstruction was possible in all and better delineated the anatomy concerning the hemodynamic relevance of stenoses even as compared with biplane angiography. The correlation between severity of narrowing assessed by diameter measurements in the biplane angiography and 2-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging was r = 0.94, and multiplanar reformation with 2-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging was r = 0.87 with a tendency of higher grading with the 3-dimensional technique (p = 0.0001). The correlation of 2-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging with invasively measured hemodynamic gradients was r = 0.67 versus r = 0.74 for the areas assessed by multiplanar reformation, indicating that the hemodynamic relevance of a morphological approach to evaluate the degree of a stenosis should better be assessed 3-dimensionally.CONCLUSIONS: The 3-dimensional reconstruction of the morphologic severity of coarctation offers additional information over conventional imaging especially in patients with kinking, complex geometry, or collaterals, in whom hemodynamic measurements can become unreliable.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Angiography', 'Aortic Coarctation', 'Child', 'Collateral Circulation', 'Female', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Linear Models', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pressure', 'Severity of Illness Index']",11727906,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.350.700.060', 'E01.370.370.050'], ['C14.240.400.090', 'C14.280.400.090', 'C16.131.240.400.090'], ['M01.060.406'], ['G09.330.100.248'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E01.370.350.400', 'L01.224.308.410'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G01.374.715'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

16021,"Stepwise abnormality of sex steroid hormone receptors, tumor suppressor gene products (p53 and Rb), and cyclin E in uterine endometrioid carcinoma.","BACKGROUND: In the normal cell cycle, the appropriate interaction of factors such as tumor suppressor gene products (retinoblastoma susceptibility [Rb], p53) and cyclins is essential. Abnormalities in the interaction of these factors may result in malignant transformation of the cell. Malignant transformation of the endometrium, which is believed to be a sex steroid-dependent tumor, probably involves a process of uncoupling of these factors and sex steroid hormone receptors. This study is designed to test this hypothesis.METHODS: Fifty-six patients whose pathology slides contained either normal or hyperplastic endometrium adjacent to endometrial carcinoma were selected. Immunohistochemical staining of serial paraffin sections was performed using antibodies to estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), p53, and Rb, as well as cyclin E.RESULTS: The normal and hyperplastic endometria adjacent to carcinoma showed positive staining for ER and PR and negative staining for p53. Of 56 carcinomas, 39 (69.6%) showed homogeneous positive staining for ER and PR and negative staining for p53, whereas the remaining 17 carcinomas (30.4%) contained varied distributions of ER- and PR-negative cells, and p53-positive cells (6 were negative or focally positive for ER/PR and diffusely-positive for p53, 4 were regionally-positive for ER/PR and regionally-positive for p53, and 7 were diffusely positive for ER/PR and focally-positive for p53). The p53-positive cells corresponded to those that stained negatively for ER/PR: This topographic inverse relationship between ER/PR expression and p53 expression also correlated with the staining intensities. Furthermore, the cells with weak or negative staining for p53 had a tendency to stain positively for Rb and weakly positive for cyclin E, whereas the cancer cells with definite positivity for p53 tended to stain either weakly or negatively for Rb and definitely positive for cyclin E. The cells showing diffusely positive for p53 were present significantly in clinical Stage III and pathologic Grade G3.CONCLUSIONS: In the development of endometrial carcinoma, stepwise abnormalities of sex steroid receptors, tumor suppressor gene products, and cyclins apparently exist, and may correlate with the progression of the malignant process.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Endometrioid', 'Cyclins', 'Endometrial Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Menopause', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Receptors, Progesterone', 'Receptors, Steroid', 'Retinoblastoma Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",8625241,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.240', 'C04.588.945.418.948.585.124', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705.331', 'C13.351.937.418.685.331', 'C13.351.937.418.875.200.124', 'C19.391.630.705.331'], ['D12.644.360.262', 'D12.776.167.218', 'D12.776.476.262'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.585', 'C13.351.500.852.762.200', 'C13.351.937.418.875.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.350', 'E05.478.583.400', 'E05.601.470.350'], ['G08.686.157.500', 'G08.686.841.249.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D12.776.826.750.350', 'D12.776.930.778.350'], ['D12.776.826.750.765'], ['D12.776.826.750', 'D12.776.930.778'], ['D12.776.260.704', 'D12.776.624.776.745', 'D12.776.660.807', 'D12.776.744.770'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
39346,Structure and genomic organization of immunoglobulin light chain in the channel catfish. An unusual genomic organizational pattern of segmental genes.,"Channel catfish L chain cDNA was obtained through a PCR strategy and used to isolate multiple L chain clones from cDNA and genomic libraries. Sequence analysis of full-length cDNA indicates that the V region is preceded by a leader peptide, and represented by framework and CDR regions. Both VL and CL domains contain the invariant cysteines and tryptophans as well as other phylogenetically conserved L chain residues. The sequence similarity of the catfish L chain with higher vertebrate kappa- and lambda-chains, however, does not readily allow the catfish L chain to be classified. Eight cDNA clones isolated from a cDNA library were shown to represent different processed derivatives of sterile L chain transcripts. These transcripts share a similar upstream sequence region and extend downstream to include a CL or alternatively a JL segment in partial germ-line configuration that has been spliced into a CL. Sequence comparisons indicate that these transcripts represent the product of different L chain loci. Genomic Southern blot analyses with VL and CL probes indicate that there are at least 30 VL segments and at least 15 CL segments. The analysis of 17 genomic L chain clones showed that each hybridized with VL-, JL-, and CL-specific probes. Characterization of the gene segments in three of these clones indicates a previously undescribed pattern of segmental gene organization. Gene segments are found in clusters with VL, JL, and CL segments in each cluster. Within a cluster VL segments reside upstream of single copies of closely linked JL and CL segments. The proximity of VL segments downstream from JL-CL segments suggests that individual clusters may be closely linked. The VL segments are located in opposite transcriptional polarity relative to the JL and CL gene segments, which indicates that VL segments are likely rearranged to JL-CL segments by inversion rather than deletion events.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Ictaluridae', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vertebrates']",8258698,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.335', 'G12.500.299'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.080.148'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.705.750', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.750', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.750'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200'], ['G02.111.810.550', 'G05.810.550'], ['G16.824'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['B01.050.150.900']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
37045,Ultrasound-assisted activation of zero-valent magnesium for nitrate denitrification: identification of reaction by-products and pathways.,"Zero-valent magnesium (Mg(0)) was activated by ultrasound (US) in an aim to promote its potential use in water treatment without pH control. In this context, nitrate reduction was studied at batch conditions using various doses of magnesium powder and ultrasound power. While neither ultrasound nor zero-valent magnesium alone was effective for reducing nitrate in water, their combination removed up to 90% of 50 mg/L NO3-N within 60 min. The rate of nitrate reduction by US/Mg(0) enhanced with increasing ultrasonic power and magnesium dose. Nitrogen gas (N2) and nitrite (NO2(-)) were detected as the major reduction by-products, while magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)2 and hydroxide ions (OH(-)) were identified as the main oxidation products. The results from SEM-EDS measurements revealed that the surface oxide level decreased significantly when the samples of Mg(0) particles were exposed to ultrasonic treatment. The surface passivation of magnesium particles was successfully minimized by mechanical forces of ultrasound, which in turn paved the way to sustain the catalyst activity toward nitrate reduction.","['Denitrification', 'Magnesium', 'Nitrates', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Ultrasonics']",25781370,"[['G02.111.587.250', 'G02.607.560.250', 'G16.500.768.249'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['D01.248.497.158.606', 'D01.625.525.550', 'D02.583'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['H01.671.031.849']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Horizontal rightward and leftward saccades were recorded binocularly, while subjects looked at LED targets placed at ±5°, 10° and 15° eccentricities. No differences in saccade amplitudes, peak velocities or durations were observed between controls and patients. More specifically, for 5° saccades, patients had a mean peak velocity of 146°/s with duration of 76ms. For 10° and 15° saccades these values were 258°/s, 86ms and 324°/s, 101ms respectively, thereby lying well within one standard deviation of the mean of normal data. Moreover, saccadic amplitude accuracy was also unimpaired. These results indicate that patients with late onset Pompe disease perform fast and accurate horizontal saccades without evidence of muscle paresis or other ocular motor abnormalities. Reported histological abnormalities of extraocular muscles do not appear to have a phenotypic impact.","['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Eye Movement Measurements', 'Female', 'Glycogen Storage Disease Type II', 'Humans', 'Infrared Rays', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oculomotor Muscles', 'Saccades', 'Severity of Illness Index']",25260626,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075.100', 'N06.850.490.250.100'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.380.230', 'E01.370.405.245.787'], ['C10.228.140.163.100.435.340', 'C16.320.565.189.435.340', 'C16.320.565.202.449.500', 'C16.320.565.595.554.340', 'C18.452.132.100.435.340', 'C18.452.648.189.435.340', 'C18.452.648.202.449.500', 'C18.452.648.595.554.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.552', 'G01.590.540.552', 'G01.750.250.650.552', 'G01.750.770.578.552', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.400', 'G16.500.750.775.525.400', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A02.633.567.700'], ['G14.350.500'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40056,The design of a low literacy decision aid about rheumatoid arthritis medications developed in three languages for use during the clinical encounter.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) care is a priority among policy makers, clinicians and patients both nationally and internationally. Demands on patients to have basic knowledge of RA, treatment options, and details of risk and benefit when making medication decisions with clinicians can be overwhelming, especially for those with limited literacy or limited English language proficiency. The objective of this study is to describe the development of a medication choice decision aid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in three languages using low literacy principles.METHODS: Based on the development of a diabetes decision aid, the RA decision aid (RA Choice) was developed through a collaborative process involving patients, clinicians, designers, decision-aid and health literacy experts. A combination of evidence synthesis and direct observation of clinician-patient interactions generated content and guided an iterative process of prototype development.RESULTS: Three iterations of RA Choice were developed and field-tested before completion. The final tool organized data using icons and plain language for 12 RA medications across 5 issues: frequency of administration, time to onset, cost, side effects, and special considerations. The tool successfully created a conversation between clinician and patient, and garnered high acceptability from clinicians.CONCLUSIONS: The process of collaboratively developing an RA decision aid designed to promote shared decision making resulted in a graphically-enhanced, low literacy tool. The use of RA Choice in the clinical encounter has the potential to enhance communication for RA patients, including those with limited health literacy and limited English language proficiency.","['Adult', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Health Literacy', 'Humans']",25649726,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C05.550.114.154', 'C05.799.114', 'C17.300.775.099', 'C20.111.199'], ['F02.463.785.373'], ['E05.245', 'L01.313.500.750.190'], ['I02.233.332.186.500', 'L01.143.450.500', 'N02.421.726.407.229.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0

33687,Nucleoside-amino acid conjugates: An alternative route to the design of ribonuclease A inhibitors.,Nucleoside-amino acid conjugates have been employed to inhibit the ribonucleolytic activity of ribonuclease A (RNase A) and affect the protonation/deprotonation equilibrium of its active site histidine residues. Agarose gel and precipitation assays indicate inhibition of RNase A activity by these molecules with a possible role of the polar side chains of the amino acids in RNase A inhibition. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that the mode of inhibition is competitive in nature with inhibition constants (K(i)) in the micromolar range. The nucleoside-serine conjugate occupies the active site of RNase A and preferential perturbs the pK(a) value of His-119 by its 'free amino group' as found from (1)H NMR studies. Docking studies revealed that the free amino groups of the most active compounds are within hydrogen bonding distance of His-119 in inhibitor-RNase A complexes.,"['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nucleosides', 'Pancreas', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic']",19540766,"[['D12.125'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['G02.282'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.599.595'], ['D09.408.595', 'D13.570'], ['A03.734'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['D08.811.277.352.355.350.715', 'D08.811.277.352.700.350.715']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

13515,Evaluation of serum granulocyte colony stimulating factor levels in infants of preeclamptic mothers.,"In this study we aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) in infants of preeclamptic mothers. The study group consisted of 31 infants of preeclamptic mothers while the control group consisted of 24 gestational age-adjusted infants of normotensive mothers. G-CSF levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mean G-CSF level was 981.8 +/- 1682.5 (25.7-5924) pg/ml in the study group and 770.8 +/- 1779 (18-8526) pg/ml in control group (p > 0.05). There was no correlation between G-CSF levels and absolute or total neutrophil counts on the 1st, 2nd and 7th days in infants of preeclamptic mothers. There were positive correlations between G-CSF levels and ANC on the 1st and 7th days of life in infants of normotensive mothers. Neutropenia developed in 42.3% of the study group and in 21.7% of the control group on the 1st day of life (p > 0.05). On the 2nd day, neutropenia was observed in 61.5% of the study group and 26.1% of the control group (p = 0.013). Serum G-CSF levels were not low in neutropenic babies of preeclamptic mothers. In contrast, higher G-CSF levels in neutropenic infants suggest impaired G-CSF response in infants of preeclamptic mothers.","['Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Very Low Birth Weight', 'Male', 'Neutropenia', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy']",17479645,"[['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['D12.644.276.374.410.240.350', 'D12.776.395.240.200', 'D12.776.467.374.410.240.350', 'D23.529.374.410.240.350'], ['D12.644.276.374.410.240.375', 'D12.776.395.240.300', 'D12.776.467.374.410.240.375', 'D23.529.374.410.240.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.703.520.460.600'], ['C15.378.553.546.184.564'], ['C13.703.395.249'], ['G08.686.784.769']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
38867,Silent versus symptomatic myocardial ischemia during exercise testing: a comparison with coronary angiographic findings.,"Two-hundred-and-eighty individuals with anginal complaints, without prior myocardial infarction and with a positive exercise stress test were divided into a group (n = 67) with exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia and another group (n = 213) with exercise-induced angina pectoris. Both underwent coronary angiography and were compared with each other with respect to various exercise and angiographic parameters. Patients with exercise-induced silent ischemia attained a longer mean exercise duration (P less than 0.001), a higher peak exercise heart rate (P less than 0.0001) and a higher peak exercise rate pressure product (P less than 0.001) than patients with exercise-induced angina pectoris. In the latter group, more patients showed exercise-induced ST-segment depression greater than 2 mm (P less than 0.05). The group of patients with silent ischemia encompassed more individuals with normal coronary arteries (P less than 0.0001). More patients with exercise-induced angina pectoris had three-vessel disease (P less than 0.0001). The exclusion of patients with normal coronary arteries (23% in those with silent ischemia group and 6% in those with exercise-induced angina had no influence on the level of significance for peak heart rate, mean exercise duration and exercise duration greater than 10 min. Thus, in this population, exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia is associated with better exercise performance and less extensive coronary arterial pathology than in exercise-induced angina pectoris.","['Adult', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Disease', 'Electrocardiography', 'Exercise Test', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stress, Physiological']",2335411,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C14.280.647.187', 'C14.907.585.187', 'C23.888.592.612.233.500'], ['E01.370.350.130.625', 'E01.370.350.700.060.200', 'E01.370.370.050.200', 'E01.370.370.380.200'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G07.775']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
30836,[A retrospective analysis of clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of gastric stump cancer].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of gastric stump cancer(GSC).METHODS: The clinical data of 138 patients with GSC treated from January 1992 to July 2008 were reviewed and analyzed. The patients included 122 males and 16 females with a mean age of 61.5 years, and the mean interval between the initial operation and second diagnosis was 21.9 years.RESULTS: The endoscopy and pathological examination showed Borrmann III/IV in 127 (92.7%) patients and undifferentiated carcinoma in 115 (83.3%) patients. The resectability and radical resectability rate were 72.4% and 59.4%. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates was 59.2%, 30.1% and 14.2%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 19.4 months. Univariate Log-rank test indicated that Borrmann type, histological type, tumor diameter, TNM stage, depth of invasion, number of metastatic lymph node, distant metastasis and option of treatment were significant prognostic factors for GSC. While TNM stage, depth of invasion, distant metastasis and option of treatment were prognostic factors on multivariable analysis. The median survival time of patients underwent radical resection was significantly longer (36 months) than that of patients received palliative resection (8 months, P < 0.05) and chemotherapy only (5 months, P < 0.05). Among patients with a tumor of T4 stage, the median survival time was statistically prolonged by combined evisceration (18.6 months) when compared with the patients received palliative surgery.CONCLUSIONS: TNM stage, depth of invasion, distant metastasis and option of treatment are independent prognostic factors for GSC. Early diagnosis and radical resection may play an important role in improving the prognosis of GSC.","['Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastric Stump', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stomach Neoplasms']",21609561,"[['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['A03.556.875.875.578'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C04.588.274.476.767', 'C06.301.371.767', 'C06.405.249.767', 'C06.405.748.789']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40745,Removal of nonionic surfactants from wastewater using a constructed wetland.,"Removal of nonionic surfactants from municipal wastewater using a constructed wetland with a horizontal subsurface flow was studied in 2009 and 2010. Extraction spectrophotometry with 3',3″,5',5″-tetrabromophenolphthalein ethyl ester and KCl served to determine the analyte concentrations. Triton(®)  X-100 was used as a standard to express the nonionic-surfactant concentrations. Anionic and cationic surfactants were shown not to interfere during the determination. Nonionic surfactants were degraded (to products undeterminable by the method) with a high average efficiency that reached 98.1% in 2009 and 99.1% in 2010, respectively. The average concentration of nonionic surfactants at the inflow was 0.978 mg/l, while it was close to the limit of quantification at the outflow (0.014 mg/l). A significant fraction of nonionic surfactants (38.7%) was already degraded during the pretreatment, and only 14.0% of the nonionic surfactants remained in the interstitial H(2) O taken in the vegetation bed at a distance of 1 m from the inflow zone at a 50-cm depth.

A quantitative chromatographic analysis of tear glucose was used and the values correlated to blood glucose values. Diabetic and nondiabetic tear glucose mean values were 0.35 +/- 0.04 mmol/L and 0.16 +/- 0.03 mmol/L, respectively. Significant differences were observed among the subject groups in both the tear and capillary blood glucose values. A correlation between tear glucose and capillary blood glucose was observed. The concentration of glucose in the tear fluid changes proportionately with respect to capillary blood glucose after a carbohydrate challenge. Although it is possible to determine the diabetic status of a subject using tear glucose values alone, in the clinical setting this may not prove to be practical due to technical limitations.","['Blood Glucose', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Glucose', 'Humans', 'Monitoring, Ambulatory', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tears']",17114114,"[['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['C18.452.394.750', 'C19.246'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.520.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['A12.200.882']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
46669,"Multi-exposure and clustering of adverse childhood experiences, socioeconomic differences and psychotropic medication in young adults.","PURPOSE: Stressful childhood experiences have negative long-term health consequences. The present study examines the association between adverse childhood experiences, socioeconomic position, and risk of psychotropic medication in young adulthood.METHODS: This register-based cohort study comprises the birth cohorts between 1985 and 1988 in Sweden. We followed 362 663 individuals for use of psychotropic medication from January 2006 until December 2008. Adverse childhood experiences were severe criminality among parents, parental alcohol or drug abuse, social assistance recipiency, parental separation or single household, child welfare intervention before the age of 12, mentally ill or suicidal parents, familial death, and number of changes in place of residency. Estimates of risk of psychotropic medication were calculated as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Adverse childhood experiences were associated with increased risks of psychotropic medication. The OR for more than three adverse childhood experiences and risk of psychotropic medication was for women 2.4 (95% CI 2.3-2.5) and for men 3.1 (95% CI 2.9-3.2). The risk of psychotropic medication increased with a higher rate of adverse childhood experiences, a relationship similar in all socioeconomic groups.CONCLUSIONS: Accumulation of adverse childhood experiences increases the risk of psychotropic medication in young adults. Parental educational level is of less importance when adjusting for adverse childhood experiences. The higher risk for future mental health problems among children from lower socioeconomic groups, compared to peers from more advantaged backgrounds, seems to be linked to a higher rate of exposure to adverse childhood experiences.","['Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sweden', 'Young Adult']",23341951,"[['M01.060.406'], ['I01.198.240.856.350.250', 'I01.880.735.900.350.250'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['N01.824.196'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['D27.505.954.427.700'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['Z01.542.816.500'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
20700,An effect of trauma on human cardiovascular control: baroreflex suppression.,"Survival from injury depends on the interaction between the patient's own homeostatic responses and treatment given. The function of the principal homeostatic reflex of the cardiovascular system, the arterial baroreflex, was studied in 22 healthy controls and in 21 moderately injured patients (ISS range, 9 to 17; median, 9) using suction stimulation of the carotid sinus baroreceptors. When compared to controls, marked baroreflex suppression was evident 3 hours after injury (p less than 0.05), at 3 days after injury (p less than 0.001), and even 15 days after injury (p less than 0.05, all Wilcoxon rank sum test). Partial recovery of baroreflex function occurred between 3 and 15 days after injury (p less than 0.005, all Wilcoxon signed rank test) and was complete by 5 months after injury. The suppression of baroreflex activity was accompanied by a ""fixed"" rise in heart rate and a rise in systolic blood pressure. This study has shown that moderate injury results in a profound and prolonged suppression of baroreflex function. Further advances in the resuscitation and critical care of the injured may need to take account of such derangements of cardiovascular physiology.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular System', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neck', 'Pressoreceptors', 'Suction', 'Wounds and Injuries']",2388307,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['A07'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.875.500', 'E05.944.600', 'N04.452.859.564.800.500', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.800.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A01.598'], ['A08.675.650.915.750.750', 'A08.800.050.800.900.700', 'A08.800.950.750.750', 'A11.671.650.915.750.750'], ['E04.237.890'], ['C26']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
39734,Thyrotropin-releasing hormone and lysine-bradykinin stimulate arachidonate liberation from rat anterior pituitary cells through different mechanisms.,"TRH and lysine-bradykinin (Lys-bradykinin) increase PRL release and arachidonate liberation from anterior pituitary cells. We investigated whether the arachidonate liberation stimulated by TRH and Lys-bradykinin originates in pituitary lactotropes and whether these events are accomplished through similar mechanisms. Lys-bradykinin and TRH rapidly (0.5 min) increased the intracellular [3H]arachidonate content of rat anterior pituitary cells. Lys-bradykinin also increased [3H]arachidonate liberation and PRL release from lactotrope-enriched pituitary cells, but not from a pituitary cell preparation with a diminished number of lactotropes. In contrast, TRH increased [3H]arachidonate liberation from both lactotrope-enriched and lactotrope-diminished preparations; this increased [3H]arachidonate liberation stimulated by TRH in the lactotrope-diminished cells may originate in the thyrotropes. The effects of TRH and Lys-bradykinin on [3H]arachidonate and [14C]stearate liberation in perfused pituitary cells also were determined. Both secretagogues increased arachidonate and stearate liberation in a biphasic manner, characterized by a transient spike, followed by a lower magnitude wave of fatty acid release. The spike phase produced by Lys-bradykinin was more pronounced than that produced by TRH. The calcium dependence of TRH- and Lys-bradykinin-stimulated arachidonate liberation also was investigated. Cobalt and the low calcium medium containing ionomycin were used to block the secretagogue-induced increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. These conditions blocked TRH-stimulated arachidonate liberation, but only marginally decreased Lys-bradykinin-stimulated arachidonate liberation, indicating that the two peptides act through different mechanisms. Therefore, TRH stimulation of arachidonate liberation is linked to an increase in intracellular calcium. In contrast, Lys-bradykinin increases arachidonate liberation through a calcium-independent intracellular mediator. This calcium-independent increase in arachidonate liberation may involve the bradykinin receptor being coupled directly to a phospholipase, a G-protein that provides a link between the bradykinin receptor and the phospholipases that liberate arachidonate, or bradykinin-induced activation of a protein kinase-C that activates the phospholipases and subsequently liberates arachidonate.","['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Kallidin', 'Kinetics', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior', 'Prolactin', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Stearic Acids', 'Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium']",1505463,"[['B01.050'], ['D10.251.355.255.100', 'D10.251.355.310.166'], ['A11.251'], ['D12.644.276.812.169.400', 'D12.644.456.193.400', 'D12.776.467.812.169.400', 'D23.469.050.375.110.400', 'D23.529.812.169.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A06.300.747.500', 'A06.688.357.750.500', 'A08.186.211.180.497.352.435.500.500', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.352.435.500.500', 'A08.713.357.750.500'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.773', 'D06.472.699.631.525.525', 'D12.644.548.691.525.525'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D10.251.882'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.880', 'D12.644.400.400.740.880', 'D12.644.456.837', 'D12.644.548.365.740.880', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.880', 'D12.776.631.650.810'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D01.268.406.875', 'D01.362.340.875', 'D01.496.749.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
36630,"Ondansetron, an antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors, in the treatment of antineoplastic drug-induced nausea and vomiting in children.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ondansetron, an antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (serotonin 3) (5-HT3) receptors, in controlling nausea and vomiting induced by antineoplastic therapy in children affected by cancer. Six patients affected by nausea and vomiting due to antineoplastic drugs were treated with ondansetron (4 mg/m2). Urinary samples for the assay of serotonin and 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were collected 24 hr before antineoplastic drug treatment, 24 hours after the start of antineoplastic therapy and, 24 hr after the start of ondansetron therapy. All patients were affected by nausea and vomiting within two to four hr after the antineoplastic treatment. Urinary concentrations of serotonin and 5-HIAA were higher and statistically significant (P < 0.01) with respect to basal values. Treatment with ondansetron significantly reduced the number of episodes of nausea and vomiting, as well as the urinary values for serotonin and 5-HIAA.","['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid', 'Nausea', 'Neoplasms', 'Ondansetron', 'Serotonin', 'Serotonin Antagonists', 'Vomiting']",7691978,"[['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.066.288.478', 'D03.633.100.473.404.478'], ['C23.888.821.712'], ['C04'], ['D03.383.129.308.690', 'D03.633.100.473.144.500', 'D03.633.300.148.500'], ['D02.092.211.215.801.852', 'D03.633.100.473.914.814', 'D23.469.050.650'], ['D27.505.519.625.850.850', 'D27.505.696.577.850.850'], ['C23.888.821.937']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
17064,Spectrum of genetic changes in patients with non-syndromic hearing impairment and extremely high carrier frequency of 35delG GJB2 mutation in Belarus.,The genetic nature of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has so far been studied for many ethnic groups in various parts of the world. The single-nucleotide guanine deletion (35delG) of the GJB2 gene coding for connexin 26 was shown to be the main genetic cause of autosomal recessive deafness among Europeans. Here we present the results of the first study of GJB2 and three mitochondrial mutations among two groups of Belarusian inhabitants: native people with normal hearing (757 persons) and 391 young patients with non-syndromic SNHL. We have found an extremely high carrier frequency of 35delG GJB2 mutation in Belarus -5.7%. This point deletion has also been detected in 53% of the patients with SNHL. The 312del14 GJB2 was the second most common mutation in the Belarus patient cohort. Mitochondrial A1555G mt-RNR1 substitution was found in two SNHL patients (0.55%) but none were found in the population cohort. No individuals carried the A7445G mutation of mitochondrial mt-TS1. G7444A as well as T961G substitutions were detected in mitochondrial mt-RNR1 at a rate of about 1% both in the patient and population cohorts. A possible reason for Belarusians having the highest mutation carrier frequency in Europe 35delG is discussed.,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Connexins', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hearing Loss', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Republic of Belarus', 'Young Adult']",22567152,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D12.776.543.585.250'], ['D13.444.308.283.225'], ['G05.380'], ['C09.218.458.341', 'C10.597.751.418.341', 'C23.888.592.763.393.341'], ['C09.218.458.341.887', 'C10.597.751.418.341.887', 'C23.888.592.763.393.341.887'], ['G05.380.383'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['G05.365.590'], ['Z01.542.248.700'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
26532,Anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory effect of a herbal nanoparticle mouthwash: a randomized crossover trial.,"Laboratory evidence has demonstrated the antimicrobial effect of Melaleuca alternifolia (MEL) against oral microorganisms. This randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial, compared the anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory effects of MEL nanoparticles with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) on biofilm-free (BF) and biofilm-covered (BC) surfaces. Before each experimental period, the participants refrained from all oral hygiene practices for 72 hours. The 60 participants were randomly assigned to professional prophylaxis in two quadrants (Q1-Q3 or Q2-Q4), and rinsed with MEL or CHX for four days. The Quigley & Hein plaque index (QHPI), gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) volume, and participants' perceptions were assessed. CHX showed significantly lower mean QHPI on BF (2.65 ± 0.34 vs. 3.34 ± 0.33, p < 0.05) and BC surfaces (2.84 ± 0.37 vs. 3.37 ± 0.33, p < 0.05). Intragroup comparisons indicated reductions in GCF in all the groups, with significant differences only for CHX on BF surfaces (p < 0.05). Intergroup comparisons revealed no significant differences (p > 0.05). Based on individual perceptions, CHX had better taste and biofilm control, but resulted in a greater change in taste. Nevertheless, MEL demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects similar to those of CHX. Further clinical trials testing different protocols, concentrations and follow-up periods are required to establish its clinical application.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Biofilms', 'Chlorhexidine', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dental Plaque', 'Dental Plaque Index', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Gingival Crevicular Fluid', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melaleuca', 'Mouthwashes', 'Nanoparticles', 'Oral Hygiene', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Surface Properties', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Visual Analog Scale', 'Young Adult']",31859706,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.158'], ['A20.593', 'G06.120'], ['D02.078.370.141.100'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['C07.793.208.377'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.300.300', 'E06.208.250', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.300.325', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.300.300', 'N06.890.160.090'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['A12.383.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.773.745'], ['D25.583', 'D27.720.102.583', 'D27.720.269.583', 'J01.637.051.583'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['E02.547.600', 'E06.761.726'], ['C07.465.714'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['G02.860'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['E01.370.928'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
4769,Outcome of the perioperative use of percutaneous cardiopulmonary support for adult cardiac surgery: factors affecting hospital mortality.,"Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support (PCPS) has become a widespread standard modality for the treatment of circulatory collapse; however, its clinical use for postcardiotomy low cardiac output syndrome (LOS) has been reported to be unsatisfactory. We reviewed the clinical outcomes of twenty-three patients undergoing cardiac surgery and treated with PCPS. Solitary coronary artery grafting was undertaken for nine patients, while three had concomitant procedures. The remaining patients underwent valvular surgery. The indications for PCPS were preoperative shock in two patients and postcardiotomy LOS or shock in twenty-one patients. All patients except one underwent an intraaortic balloon pump. Sixteen of the twenty-three patients (69.6%) were weaned from PCPS and twelve patients (52.2%) reached hospital discharge. A univariate analysis revealed that risk factors for hospital mortality were age older than seventy years (P = 0.05), PCPS running time (P = 0.017), low cardiac function at the institution of PCPS (P = 0.004), and urine output within the initial 24 h (P = 0.041). The cardiac index (CI) in survivors was improved within 24 h, and eleven of the twelve survivors were weaned off PCPS within 48 h, whereas ten of the twelve nonsurvivors required PCPS for more than 48 h (P = 0.0006). There is little possibility of weaning patients from PCPS who do not show any signs of hemodynamic recovery within 48 h after its institution. Limited use of PCPS within 48 h may be applicable for postcardiotomy patients, but other cardiopulmonary support, such as a left ventricular assist device, may be required when hemodynamic recovery is not obtained within 48 h.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Assisted Circulation', 'Cardiac Output', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart-Lung Machine', 'Hemodynamics', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Perioperative Care', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Urine']",14961959,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E04.050'], ['E01.370.370.380.150', 'G09.330.380.124'], ['C14.280'], ['E07.858.082.458'], ['G09.330.380'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.400', 'N01.224.935.698.400', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.400', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N04.761.559', 'N05.715.360.575'], ['E02.760.731', 'E04.604', 'N02.421.585.722'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['G01.910.857'], ['A12.207.927']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
2015,Relationship between hyperacute blood pressure and outcome after ischemic stroke: data from the VISTA collaboration.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High blood pressure (BP) is associated independently with poor outcome after acute ischemic stroke, although in most analyses ""baseline"" BP was measured 24 hours or more postictus, and not during the hyperacute period.METHODS: Analyses included 1722 patients in hyperacute trials (recruitment <8 hours) from the Virtual Stroke International Stroke Trial Archive (VISTA) Collaboration. Data on BP at enrollment and after 1, 2, 16, 24, 48, and 72 hours, neurological impairment at 7 days (NIHSS), and functional outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin scale) were assessed using logistic regression models, adjusted for confounding variables; results are for 10-mm Hg change in BP.RESULTS: Mean time to enrollment was 3.7 hours (range 1.0 to 7.9). High systolic BP (SBP) was significantly associated with increased neurological impairment (odds ratio, OR 1.06, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.12), and poor functional outcome; odds ratios for both increased with later BP measurements made at up to 24 hours poststroke. Smaller (versus larger) declines in SBP over the first 24 hours were significantly associated with poor NIHSS scores (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.27) and functional outcome (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.34). A large variability in SBP was also associated with poor functional outcome.CONCLUSIONS: High SBP and large variability in SBP in the hyperacute stages of ischemic stroke are associated with increased neurological impairment and poor functional outcome, as are small falls in SBP over the first 24 hours.","['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Nervous System Diseases', 'Odds Ratio', 'Stroke', 'Treatment Outcome']",19359649,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.411.162'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['C10.228.140.300.150', 'C14.907.253.092'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['C10'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
28273,Estimating costs associated with a community outbreak of meningococcal disease in a colombian Caribbean city.,"Meningococcal disease is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection that is caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis), and it can cause meningitis, meningococcaemia outbreaks and epidemics. The disease is fatal in 9-12% of cases and with a death rate of up to 40% among patients with meningococcaemia. The objective of this study was to estimate the costs of a meningococcal outbreak that occurred in a Caribbean city of Colombia. We contacted experts involved in the outbreak and asked them specific questions about the diagnosis and treatment for meningococcal cases during the outbreak. Estimates of costs of the outbreak were also based on extensive review of medical records available during the outbreak. The costs associated with the outbreak were divided into the cost of the disease response phase and the cost of the disease surveillance phase. The costs associated with the outbreak control and surveillance were expressed in US$ (2011) as cost per 1,000 inhabitants. The average age of patients was 4.6 years (SD 3.5); 50% of the cases died; 50% of the cases were reported to have meningitis (3/6); 33% were diagnosed with meningococcaemia and myocarditis (2/6); 50% of the cases had bacteraemia (3/6); 66% of the cases had a culture specimen positive for Neisseria meningitidis; 5 of the 6 cases had RT-PCR positive for N. meningitidis. All N. meningitidis were serogroup B; 50 doses of ceftriaxone were administered as prophylaxis. Vaccine was not available at the time. The costs associated with control of the outbreak were estimated at US$ 0.8 per 1,000 inhabitants, disease surveillance at US$ 4.1 per 1,000 inhabitants, and healthcare costs at US$ 5.1 per 1,000 inhabitants. The costs associated with meningococcal outbreaks are substantial, and the outbreaks should be prevented. The mass chemoprophylaxis implemented helped control the outbreak.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colombia', 'Cost of Illness', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meningococcal Infections', 'Neisseria meningitidis', 'Sentinel Surveillance']",25395916,"[['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['E02.319.162.150', 'E02.319.703.150'], ['D02.065.589.099.249.190.190.155', 'D02.886.665.074.190.190.155', 'D03.633.100.300.249.190.190.155'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['Z01.107.757.284'], ['N03.219.151.165', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.182', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.046'], ['N06.850.290'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C01.150.252.400.625.549'], ['B03.440.400.425.550.550.641', 'B03.660.075.525.520.500'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700.650', 'E05.318.650', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625.650', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700.650', 'N06.850.520.699', 'N06.850.780.675.650']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
33367,Rapid detection of the Chlamydiaceae and other families in the order Chlamydiales: three PCR tests.,"Few identification methods will rapidly or specifically detect all bacteria in the order Chlamydiales, family Chlamydiaceae. In this study, three PCR tests based on sequence data from over 48 chlamydial strains were developed for identification of these bacteria. Two tests exclusively recognized the Chlamydiaceae: a multiplex test targeting the ompA gene and the rRNA intergenic spacer and a TaqMan test targeting the 23S ribosomal DNA. The multiplex test was able to detect as few as 200 inclusion-forming units (IFU), while the TaqMan test could detect 2 IFU. The amplicons produced in these tests ranged from 132 to 320 bp in length. The third test, targeting the 23S rRNA gene, produced a 600-bp amplicon from strains belonging to several families in the order Chlamydiales. Direct sequence analysis of this amplicon has facilitated the identification of new chlamydial strains. These three tests permit ready identification of chlamydiae for diagnostic and epidemiologic study. The specificity of these tests indicates that they might also be used to identify chlamydiae without culture or isolation.","['Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins', 'Chlamydiaceae', 'Chlamydiaceae Infections', 'Chlamydiales', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Ribosomal', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Bacterial', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 23S', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",9986815,"[['D12.776.097.120', 'D12.776.543.100'], ['B03.440.190.190'], ['C01.150.252.400.210'], ['B03.440.190'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['D13.444.308.475'], ['C01.150.252.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G05.360.340.024.220.400', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.515'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D13.444.735.473'], ['D13.444.735.686.680'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

5529,Lactoperoxidase activity in milk is correlated with somatic cell count in dairy cows.,"Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a milk protein with antimicrobial function. The present study was undertaken to examine the correlation between LPO activity and somatic cell count (SCC) in milk to use LPO activity as an indicator of mastitis. Composite milk of 36 cows and quarter milk of 3 cows were collected once per week from 0 to 300 d postpartum and twice per day for 1 wk, respectively. For the measurement of LPO activity, milk was mixed with tetramethylbenzidine solution and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, followed by the measurement of optical density. When only milk with low SCC (132±12?10(3) cells/mL) was used, a significant decrease in LPO activity was detected in primiparous cows from 0 to 4 mo postpartum. Lactoperoxidase activities of primiparous cows in mo 1, 2, and 3 postpartum were significantly higher than those in multiparous cows. When composite milk was divided based on LPO activity, the SCC was significantly higher in the groups with LPO activity >5 and from 3 to 3.9 U/mL in the second- and fourth-parity cows, respectively, compared with the group with LPO activity <2U/mL. Extremely high SCC were found in the ?fifth-parity cows, even in low-LPO activity groups. In the case of quarter milk, higher LPO activity was associated with increased SCC in all 3 cows. The percentage of quarter milk samples with high SCC (4,062±415?10(3) cells/mL) increased with an increase in the LPO activity. The percentage of quarter milk samples with high SCC was 50.0 to 100% in the milk with LPO activity ?5 U/mL. These results indicate that the correlation of LPO activity to the SCC in bovine milk may point to the potential use of the former as an indicator of SCC.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Lactoperoxidase', 'Milk', 'Parity']",21787923,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['E01.370.225.500.195', 'E05.200.500.195', 'E05.242.195', 'G04.140'], ['D08.811.682.732.550'], ['A12.200.455', 'A12.790', 'G07.203.100.700', 'G07.203.300.350.525', 'J02.200.700', 'J02.500.350.525'], ['G08.686.677', 'G08.686.784.769.472', 'N06.850.490.812.600']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

Eighteen transition pathways, each connecting one random coil configuration with an ideal alpha-helical configuration, were computed and analyzed. The transition pathway energetics and mechanism were analyzed in terms of the progression of the peptide nonbonded contact formation, helicity, end-to-end distance and energetics. It was found that (1) localized turns characterized by i, i + 3 hydrogen bonds form in the early stages of the coil-to-helix transition, (2) the peptide first collapses and then becomes somewhat more extended in the final stage of helix formation, and (3) 310-helix formation does not appear to be a necessary step in the transition from coil to helix.

44049,Elevated BIS and Entropy values after sugammadex or neostigmine: an electroencephalographic or electromyographic phenomenon?,"BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is designed to antagonize neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by rocuronium or vecuronium. In clinical practice, we have noticed a rise in the numerical values of bispectral index (BIS) and Entropy, two electroencephalogram (EEG) - based depth of anesthesia monitors, during the reversal of the NMB with sugammadex. The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was to test this impression and to compare the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on the BIS and Entropy values during the reversal of the NMB.METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing gynecological operations were studied. Patients were anesthetized with target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil, and rocuronium was used to induce NMB. After operation, during light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, NMB was antagonized with sugammadex or neostigmine. During the following 5 min, the numerical values of BIS, BIS electromyographic (BIS EMG) and Entropy were recorded on a laptop computer, as well as the biosignal recorded by the Entropy strip. The Entropy biosignal was studied off-line both in time and frequency domain to see if NMB reversal causes changes in EEG.RESULTS: In some patients, administration of sugammadex or neostigmine caused a significant rise in the numerical values of BIS, BIS EMG and Entropy. This phenomenon was most likely caused by increased electromyographic (EMG) activity. The administration of sugammadex or neostigmine appeared to have only minimal effect on EEG.CONCLUSION: The EMG contamination of EEG causes BIS and Entropy values to rise during reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB in light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.","['Adult', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Entropy', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neostigmine', 'Neuromuscular Blockade', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sugammadex', 'gamma-Cyclodextrins']",22289106,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A07.035', 'A08.186.211.035'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['G01.906.345'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.092.877.674.666', 'D02.675.276.602'], ['E03.706', 'E05.635'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D04.345.103.444.500', 'D09.698.365.855.400.375.444.500'], ['D04.345.103.444', 'D09.301.915.400.375.444', 'D09.698.365.855.400.375.444']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
38677,Dentin-predentin complex and its permeability: physiologic overview.,"The major channels for solute diffusion across dentin are the dentinal tubules. Since dentin permeation is proportional to the product of tubule number and diameter, both of which increase as the tubules converge on the pulp, we find that dentin permeability increases rapidly as the pulp chamber is approached. The presence of a smear layer of cutting debris on top of cut dentin decreases dentin permeability, especially when permeability is measured by fluid filtration. Further, intratubular material--such as mineral deposits, collagen fibrils, proteoglycan linings, bacteria, etc.--can greatly reduce dentin permeability. Although the presence of irregular or irritation dentin has been thought to greatly reduce dentin permeability, recent in vivo experiments in dogs indicate that the dentin permeability of freshly cut cavities prepared in sound dentin falls very rapidly (i.e., 50-60% in the first six hours) before any histologic changes can be detected, either in the pulp or the dentin.

16967,Selective versus non-selective antiarrhythmic approach for prevention of atrial fibrillation after coronary surgery: is there a need for pre-operative risk stratification? A prospective placebo-controlled study using low-dose sotalol.,"AIM: This study evaluated the advantages of 'selective' over 'non-selective' antiarrhythmic prevention of atrial fibrillation after coronary surgery based on a new risk prediction algorithm.METHODS AND RESULTS: In a retrospective analysis of a prospective randomized trial, a model for risk prediction was determined based on clinical data of the control group (A; n = 107) and tested in a test group (B; n = 107, treated with low dose sotalol). Using this algorithm, the effect of a 'selective' antiarrhythmic approach in high-risk patients was compared to a 'non-selective' approach, where all patients were treated. In total, 75 (35%) patients developed atrial fibrillation and 14 (7%) side-effects led to discontinuation of study medication. Based on the risk prediction algorithm, 36% of group A patients were classified as high-risk patients with an incidence of atrial fibrillation of 76% compared to 26% in low-risk patients (P < 0.0001). The selective approach, i.e. treatment of high-risk patients only reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation from 76% to 50% (P = 0.0295) compared to a reduction from 44% to 26% (P = 0.0065) when all patients were treated. More importantly, with the non-selective approach 100% of patients were exposed to the possible side-effects of sotalol and costs compared to 24% only with the selective approach (P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Thus, a selective approach based on a clinical risk prediction algorithm should improve the cost-effectiveness and safety of low-dose sotalol in the prevention of atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sotalol']",9717015,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['D27.505.954.411.097'], ['C14.280.067.198', 'C23.550.073.198'], ['E04.100.376.719.332', 'E04.100.814.868.750', 'E04.928.220.520.220'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['D02.033.100.291.805', 'D02.092.063.291.805']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
368,Effects of nitric oxide on detrusor relaxation.,"PURPOSE: Recently we (1994) reported the photo-induced adequate nitric oxide (PIANO) system, in which an NO- or NO2-carrying molecule which has been photoactivated to release NO, could be exploited to investigate the role of NO in various smooth muscle functions. This study was designed to characterize the effect of nitric oxide (NO) exploiting PIANO on rat detrusor relaxation by isometric tension recording and measuring changes in cGMP content.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exposure to ultraviolet light was used (1 to 60 seconds) to evoke PIANO in the presence of streptozotocin, an NO-carrier, and N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), an NO2-carrier. During relaxation the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content was measured by radioimmunoassay.RESULTS: Rat detrusor strips were reversibly relaxed upon NO generation via PIANO. Pyrogallol, an O2 generator, significantly (p < 0.01) diminished PIANO-mediated relaxation. During PIANO-mediated relaxation, the tissue level of cyclic GMP significantly (p < 0.05) increased over that of the control. Furthermore, methylene blue, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited both the relaxation and the increase of cGMP.CONCLUSION: We concluded that rat detrusor muscle was capable of responding to NO, and these findings might lead to a treatment for bladder instability and detrusor hyperreflexia, by the use of intravesical instillation of NO donors.","['Animals', 'Arginine', 'Cyclic GMP', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Male', 'Methylene Blue', 'Muscle, Smooth', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Nitroarginine', 'Pyrogallol', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Streptozocin', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Urinary Bladder']",8618342,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.125.068.050', 'D12.125.095.104', 'D12.125.142.087'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.454.160', 'D13.695.462.275', 'D13.695.667.454.160', 'D13.695.827.426.160'], ['E05.481'], ['G11.427.494.472'], ['D02.886.369.517', 'D03.633.300.783.517'], ['A02.633.570', 'A10.690.467'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772'], ['D12.125.068.050.587', 'D12.125.095.104.587'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.800'], ['E01.370.384.700', 'E05.478.566.639', 'E05.601.470.639'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D02.065.950.594.768', 'D02.654.692.768', 'D09.408.051.900'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600'], ['A05.810.890']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
22766,"Plasma membrane Pdia3 and VDR interact to elicit rapid responses to 1á,25(OH)(2)D(3).","1á,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1á,25(OH)2D3) regulates osteoblasts through genomic and rapid membrane-mediated responses. Here we examined the interaction of protein disulfide isomerase family A, member 3 (Pdia3) and the traditional vitamin D receptor (VDR) in plasma membrane-associated responses to 1á,25(OH)2D3. We found that Pdia3 co-localized with VDR and the caveolae scaffolding protein, caveolin-1 on the surface of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Immunoprecipitation showed that both Pdia3 and VDR interacted with caveolin-1. Pdia3 further interacted with phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAA), whereas VDR interacted with c-Src. 1á,25(OH)2D3 changed the interactions and transport of the two receptors and rapidly activated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and c-Src. Silencing either receptor or caveolin-1 inhibited both PLA2 and c-Src, indicating that the two receptors function interdependently. These two receptor dependent rapid responses to 1á,25(OH)2D3 regulated gene expression, proliferation and apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells.

6772,High frequency of concomitant mastocytosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia exhibiting the transforming KIT mutation D816V.,"The KIT mutation D816V is associated with autonomous growth of mast cells (MC) and is detectable in most patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM), including cases with associated hematologic non-MC-lineage disease (AHNMD). Recently, KIT D816V was reported to be expressed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, it was not clarified whether these patients have co-existing occult SM. We investigated neoplastic cells in 101 patients with AML for expression of KIT D816V. In 7/101 patients (6.9%), KIT D816V was detectable. After a thorough histologic, molecular, and biochemical analysis, all 7 cases were found to have an associated SM, leading to the final diagnosis SM-AML. Microdissected tryptase+ MC displayed KIT D816V in all patients tested, whereas CD34+ blasts exhibited KIT D816V in only 2/4 patients. In one AML patient, SM without KIT D816V was detected. In all other patients, no associated SM was found, and leukemic blasts were negative for KIT D816V. In summary, our data show that KIT D816V in AML is highly associated with co-existing SM (SM-AML). Moreover, our data show that AML blasts may lack this transforming target-mutant, which may be important when considering the use of KIT D816V-targeting drugs for treatment of patients with KIT D816V-positive AML.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Mast Cells', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tryptases', 'Young Adult']",20471335,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['C04.557.337.539.275'], ['A11.329.427', 'A15.382.652'], ['C04.557.450.565.465.750', 'C20.543.520.350.750'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G05.365.795.595'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.050', 'D12.776.543.750.630.124', 'D12.776.543.750.705.852.150.100', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.200.170', 'D12.776.624.664.700.183'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.902', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.902'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
7421,Combined liver-kidney transplantation versus liver transplant alone based on KDIGO stratification of estimated glomerular filtration rate: data from the United Kingdom Transplant registry - a retrospective cohort study.,"Patient selection for combined liver-kidney transplantation (CLKT) is a current issue on the background of organ shortage. This study aimed to compare outcomes and post-transplant renal function for patients receiving CLKT and liver transplantation alone (LTA) based on native renal function using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) stratification. Using the UK National transplant database (NHSBT) 6035 patients receiving a LTA (N = 5912; 98%) or CLKT (N = 123; 2%) [2001-2013] were analysed, and stratified by KDIGO stages of eGFR at transplant (eGFR group-strata). There was no difference in patient/graft survival between LTA and CLKT in eGFR group-strata (P > 0.05). Of 377 patients undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) at time of transplantation, 305 (81%) and 72 (19%) patients received LTA and CLKT respectively. A significantly greater proportion of CLKT patients had severe end-stage renal disease (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) at 1 year post-transplant compared to LTA (9.5% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). Patient and graft survival benefit for patients on RRT at transplantation was favouring CLKT versus LTA (P = 0.038 and P = 0.018, respectively) but the renal function of the long-term survivors was not superior following CLKT. The data does not support CLKT approach based on eGFR alone, and the advantage of CLKT appear to benefit only those who are on established RRT at the time of transplant.","['Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom']",30793378,"[['E01.370.390.400.300', 'G08.852.357'], ['G12.875.545.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.870.500', 'E04.936.450.485', 'E04.950.774.400'], ['E02.095.147.725.490', 'E04.210.650', 'E04.936.450.490', 'E04.936.580.490'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Thirty-six patients had been pretreated with anthracyclines and 8 were resistant. The combination of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and vinorelbine (25 mg/m2) was administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks, for a total of 6 cycles.RESULTS: A total of 344 cycles of chemotherapy were administered (median 4 cycles per patient). Partial responses were observed in 31 patients (36.0%; 95% CI: 23-56). The median duration of response was 7 months (range 3-11 months) and the median overall survival was 14 months (range 6-21). The scheme was well tolerated.CONCLUSION: The combination of vinorelbine and gemcitabine is an active scheme in pretreated MBC, demonstrating an acceptable toxicity profile, and may well represent a valuable therapeutic choice after anthracycline/taxane regimens.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Deoxycytidine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Vinblastine', 'Vinorelbine']",16739318,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500', 'D13.570.230.329', 'D13.570.685.245.500'], ['E02.319.283'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.132.436.681.827.650', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.827.650', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.827.650'], ['D03.132.436.681.827.915', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.827.915', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.827.915']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
15248,Light-mediated activation reveals a key role for Rac in collective guidance of cell movement in vivo.,"The small GTPase Rac induces actin polymerization, membrane ruffling and focal contact formation in cultured single cells but can either repress or stimulate motility in epithelial cells depending on the conditions. The role of Rac in collective epithelial cell movements in vivo, which are important for both morphogenesis and metastasis, is therefore difficult to predict. Recently, photoactivatable analogues of Rac (PA-Rac) have been developed, allowing rapid and reversible activation or inactivation of Rac using light. In cultured single cells, light-activated Rac leads to focal membrane ruffling, protrusion and migration. Here we show that focal activation of Rac is also sufficient to polarize an entire group of cells in vivo, specifically the border cells of the Drosophila ovary. Moreover, activation or inactivation of Rac in one cell of the cluster caused a dramatic response in the other cells, suggesting that the cells sense direction as a group according to relative levels of Rac activity. Communication between cells of the cluster required Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) but not guidance receptor signalling. These studies further show that photoactivatable proteins are effective tools in vivo.","['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Surface Extensions', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Drosophila', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Proteins']",20473296,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['A11.284.180'], ['A11.251'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.750.310.250'], ['A11.436'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
14996,Stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 heals rectovaginal fistula in rats.,"AIM: Rectovaginal fistula is a devastating condition providing more than 99% of patients for surgical treatment. We hypothesized that rectovaginal fistula may be healed by therapy with stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, in consistence with its initial clinical application and effect on external fistulas.MAIN METHODS: BPC 157 (10ìg/kg or 10ng/kg) was given perorally, in drinking water (0.16ìg/ml or 0.16ng/ml, 12ml/rat/day) till sacrifice, or alternatively, intraperitoneally, first application at 30min after surgery, last at 24h before sacrifice. Controls simultaneously received an equivolume of saline (5.0ml/kg ip) or water only (12ml/rat/day). The assessment (i.e., rectal and vaginal defect, fistula leakage, defecation through the fistula, adhesions and intestinal obstruction as healing processes) was at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21.KEY FINDINGS: Regularly, rectovaginal fistulas exhibited poor healing, with both of the defects persisting, continuous fistula leakage, defecation through the fistula, advanced adhesion formation and intestinal obstruction. By contrast, BPC 157 given perorally or intraperitoneally, in ìg- and ng-regimens rapidly improved the whole presentation, with both rectal and vaginal defects simultaneously ameliorated and eventually healed. The maximal instilled volume was continuously raised till the values of healthy rats were achieved, there were no signs of defecation through the fistula. A counteraction of advanced adhesion formation and intestinal obstruction was achieved. Microscopic improvement was along with macroscopic findings.SIGNIFICANCE: BPC 157 effects appear to be suited to induce a full healing of rectovaginal fistulas in rats.","['Animals', 'Anti-Ulcer Agents', 'Female', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Rectovaginal Fistula', 'Wound Healing']",26872976,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.483.203'], ['D12.644.541'], ['D12.776'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['C06.267.550.600.650', 'C06.405.469.471.600.650', 'C06.405.469.860.752.650', 'C13.351.500.894.767.249', 'C23.300.575.185.550.600.650', 'C23.300.575.925.558'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23752,Induction of cytoplasmic factors that bind to the 3' AU-rich region of human interferon beta mRNA during early development of Xenopus laevis.,"Certain endogenous Xenopus mRNAs, carrying a destabilizing 3' AU-rich sequence, are unusually very stable in oocytes and become unstable only after fertilization. In addition, heterologous short lived mRNA, containing 3' AU-rich sequences, appear to be very stable when injected into Xenopus oocytes. In the present study, a human interferon beta (hu-IFN beta) mRNA, carrying the destabilizing 3' AU-rich element, was used as a probe to identify Xenopus proteins that specifically bind to the 3' AU-rich element as well as to study their relative levels during early embryonic development. While three major proteins that specifically bind to the 3' AU-rich element were detected in human SV80 cells, that naturally express hu-IFN beta (proteins termed AU-F1, F2 and F3), only two proteins, migrating similarly to the SV80 AU-F1 and AU-F3, were detected in cytoplasmic extracts from Xenopus oocytes or eggs. Following fertilization, the intensity of the Xenopus AU-F1 and AU-F3 proteins increased considerably and a new protein, corresponding to SV80 AU-F2, was also detected. Cyclohexamide applied either at the morula or at the early blastula stages reduced the intensity of the AU-binding factors, while actinomycin D did not, indicating that the levels of these factors during these stages are regulated posttranscriptionally. In contrast, application of each of these metabolic inhibitors at the late blastula stage increased the intensity of the AU-binding proteins. The possible function of these AU-binding factors in regulating the expression and half life of AU-rich mRNAs is discussed.","['Adenine', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Blastocyst', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm', 'Egg Proteins', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta', 'Morula', 'Oocytes', 'Ovum', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Uracil', 'Xenopus laevis']",8282101,"[['D03.633.100.759.138'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['A16.254.500'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A11.284.430.214'], ['D12.776.290'], ['A13.350', 'A16.331'], ['G08.686.784.277'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.275', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.275', 'D23.529.374.440.890.275'], ['A16.615'], ['A05.360.490.690.680', 'A11.497.497.600'], ['A05.360.490.690', 'A11.497.497', 'A16.690'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D12.776.157.725', 'D12.776.664.962'], ['D03.383.742.698.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.610.500.562']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
38744,Oncolytic adenovirus coding for granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor induces antitumoral immunity in cancer patients.,"Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) can mediate antitumor effects by recruiting natural killer cells and by induction of tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cells through antigen-presenting cells. Oncolytic tumor cell-killing can produce a potent costimulatory danger signal and release of tumor epitopes for antigen-presenting cell sampling. Therefore, an oncolytic adenovirus coding for GMCSF was engineered and shown to induce tumor-specific immunity in an immunocompetent syngeneic hamster model. Subsequently, 20 patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapies were treated with Ad5-D24-GMCSF. Of the 16 radiologically evaluable patients, 2 had complete responses, 1 had a minor response, and 5 had disease stabilization. Responses were frequently seen in injected and noninjected tumors. Treatment was well tolerated and resulted in the induction of both tumor-specific and virus-specific immunity as measured by ELISPOT and pentamer analysis. This is the first time that oncolytic virus-mediated antitumor immunity has been shown in humans. Ad5-D24-GMCSF is promising for further clinical testing.","['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', 'Cricetinae', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transfection']",20484030,"[['B04.280.030'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['D23.050.550.402'], ['D12.644.276.374.410.240.350', 'D12.776.395.240.200', 'D12.776.467.374.410.240.350', 'D23.529.374.410.240.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.095.465.425'], ['D08.811.464.938.750.210', 'D12.644.360.075.437', 'D12.776.476.075.437'], ['D12.776.220.600.450', 'D12.776.631.560'], ['C04'], ['E02.095.601'], ['D12.644.360.075.437.625', 'D12.776.167.576', 'D12.776.220.600.450.495', 'D12.776.476.075.437.625'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
417,A cautionary note concerning the use of stabilized weights in marginal structural models.,"Marginal structural models are commonly used to estimate the causal effect of a time-varying treatment in presence of time-dependent confounding. When fitting an MSM to data, the analyst must specify both the structural model for the outcome and the treatment models for the inverse-probability-of-treatment weights. The use of stabilized weights is recommended because they are generally less variable than the standard weights. In this paper, we are concerned with the use of the common stabilized weights when the structural model is specified to only consider partial treatment history, such as the current or most recent treatments. We present various examples of settings where these stabilized weights yield biased inferences while the standard weights do not. These issues are first investigated on the basis of simulated data and subsequently exemplified using data from the Honolulu Heart Program. Unlike common stabilized weights, we find that basic stabilized weights offer some protection against bias in structural models designed to estimate current or most recent treatment effects.","['Bias', 'Biostatistics', 'Blood Pressure', 'Causality', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Motor Activity', 'Observational Studies as Topic']",25410264,"[['N05.715.350.150', 'N06.850.490.500'], ['E05.318.740.237'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['N05.715.350.200', 'N06.850.490.625'], ['L01.224.160'], ['N05.715.350.240', 'N06.850.490.718'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['F01.145.632', 'G11.427.410.698'], ['E05.318.372.250.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.500']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
47064,A new method of spatial compounding imaging.,"A new method of spatial compound imaging is presented that improves image quality without the usual requirement to decrease the frame rate. The new method of imaging utilizes three transducers for data acquisition. The transducer located at the center of the transducer system is a phased array probe that acts as both transmitter and receiver. The other transducers are unfocused pistons that act only as receivers. Envelope data acquired by each transducer are combined to form a final image with improved quality (speckle contrast, target detectability and lateral resolution). It is shown that the improvement in speckle contrast depends on the correlation between individual images acquired by the transducers. The effective aperture approach is used for analytic estimation of the correlation between images in order to optimize the lateral separation between transducers. Using simulations, several compounding strategies have been performed to find the strategy that maximizes image quality. The central frequency of 2.5 MHz is used in simulations. Quantitative analysis of simulated B-mode images shows that the new method of imaging efficiently improves visibility, detectability, and lateral resolution of low contrast regions. The image frame rate is preserved because multiple scans are not required for the spatial compounding.","['Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonography']",12788220,"[['L01.224.160'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.600.350', 'L01.224.308.380'], ['L01.224.800'], ['E07.305.812'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
32698,Changing organisations: a study of the context and processes of mergers of health care providers in England.,"This paper presents findings from a study of the context and processes of provider mergers in the NHS in England. Mergers are an example of organisational restructuring, a key lever for change in the UK health care sector and elsewhere, although it is only one strategy for organisational change. The framework for the study is key themes from the organisational change literature: the complexity of the effects of change; the importance of context; and the role of organisational culture. The drivers for health care mergers and the evidence for these are analysed. Using documentary analysis and in-depth qualitative interviews with internal and external stakeholders, the first part of the paper reports on stated and unstated drivers in nine mergers. This provides the context for four in-depth case studies of the process of merger in the second and third years post-merger. Our study shows that the contexts of mergers, including drivers of change, are important. Merger is a process without clear boundaries, and this study shows problems persisting into the third year post-merger. Loss of management control and focus led to delays in service developments. Difficulties in the merger process included perceived differences in organisational culture and perceptions of 'takeover' which limited sharing of 'good practice' across newly merged organisations. Merger policy was based on simplistic assumptions about processes of organisational change that do not take into account the dynamic relationship between the organisation and its context and between the organisation and individuals within it. Understanding the process of merger better should lead to a more cautious approach to the likely gains, provide understanding of the problems that are likely in the period of change, and anticipate and avoid harmful consequences.","['England', 'Health Facility Merger', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Mental Health Services', 'Organizational Innovation', 'Organizational Objectives', 'State Medicine']",15482872,"[['Z01.542.363.300'], ['N02.278.235'], ['M01.526.485', 'N02.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.408', 'N02.421.461'], ['N04.452.610'], ['N04.452.615'], ['N03.349.550.902', 'N03.858']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
21885,Comparison of changes in the hypoglossal and the phrenic nerve activity in response to increasing depth of anesthesia in cats.,"The effects of increasing depths of anesthesia on the activities of the hypoglossal nerve (HN) and the phrenic nerve (PN) were investigated in artificially ventilated, vagotomized cats. An abrupt increase in inspired concentration of halothane from 1% to 4% immediately decreased both HN and PN activities, but HN activity decreased more and disappeared much earlier than did PN activity. Steady-state responses of HN and PN activities to changes in end-tidal concentration of halothane showed that halothane depressed both HN and PN activities in a dose-related manner but at different rates, suggesting that respiratory control of the tongue muscles and the diaphragm are in part mediated by different neural pathways. Differential suppression of PN and HN activities also was observed following an acute increase in anesthetic depth with thiopental and diazepam. In contrast, no such differential suppression was observed following ketamine administration. Thus, differential suppression of PN and HN may be associated not only with depth of anesthesia but also with the type of anesthetic used.","['Anesthesia, Inhalation', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Diaphragm', 'Diazepam', 'Halothane', 'Hypoglossal Nerve', 'Ketamine', 'Phrenic Nerve', 'Thiopental', 'Tongue', 'Vagotomy', 'Vagus Nerve']",6691591,"[['E03.155.197.197'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.377.750.250.125'], ['G07.690.773.750'], ['A02.633.567.900.300'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.070.216'], ['D02.455.526.340'], ['A08.800.800.120.330'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.367.652'], ['A08.800.800.720.150.700'], ['D03.383.742.698.253.800.810'], ['A03.556.500.885', 'A14.549.885'], ['E04.525.210.105.600.850'], ['A08.800.050.050.925', 'A08.800.050.600.825', 'A08.800.800.060.920', 'A08.800.800.120.900']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

19065,Job satisfaction among primary health care workers in three selected local government areas in southwest Nigeria.,"BACKGROUND: The primary health care system in Nigeria has been impaired by lack of dedicated workers who are willing to work in the rural areas. This study was carried out to examine factors that enhance job satisfaction among health workers in the primary health care system in Nigeria.METHOD: The study is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in May 2002. The respondents were selected from three local government areas in southwest Nigeria by multistage sampling technique. A standardized structured pre-coded close-ended self-administered questionnaire to collect relevant information on their socio-demographic characteristics and extent of job satisfaction of respondents.RESULT: A total of 125 health workers were interviewed in all. The mean score on job satisfaction was 26.15 out of the total possible score of 49. There was no statistically significant relationship in job satisfaction among the various cadres of health workers considered (p = 0.824). A larger proportion (66.4%) of the health workers were involved with the community based preventive services when compared with the health centre based curative care 33.4% (p < 0.05), there is however no significant difference in satisfaction between this two groups of personnel (p = 0.133). Age and marital status were found to be statistically significant in relation to job satisfaction (p = 0.000 and 0.034 respectively).CONCLUSION: The study shows no significant difference in job satisfaction among the various cadres of health workers in southwest Nigeria.

48538,Prey body mass and richness underlie the persistence of a top predator.,"Predators and prey often differ in body mass. The ratio of predator to prey body mass influences the predator's functional response (how consumption varies with prey density), and therefore, the strength and stability of the predator-prey interaction. The persistence of food chains is maximized when prey species are neither too big nor too small relative to their predator. Nonetheless, we do not know if (i) food web persistence requires that all predator-prey body mass ratios are intermediate, nor (ii) if this constraint depends on prey diversity. We experimentally quantified the functional response for a single predator consuming prey species of different body masses. We used the resultant allometric functional response to parametrize a food web model. We found that predator persistence was maximized when the minimum prey size in the community was intermediate, but as prey diversity increased, the minimum body size could take a broader range of values. This last result occurs because of Jensen's inequality: the average handling time for multiple prey of different sizes is higher than the handling time of the average sized prey. Our results demonstrate that prey diversity mediates how differences between predators and prey in body mass determine food web stability.","['Animals', 'Body Size', 'Coleoptera', 'Diptera', 'Food Chain', 'Insecta', 'Models, Biological', 'Odonata', 'Oligochaeta', 'Predatory Behavior']",31064301,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160', 'E05.041.124.160', 'G07.100.100.160', 'G07.345.249.314'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.375'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.750'], ['G16.500.275.157.250', 'N06.230.124.250'], ['B01.050.500.131.617'], ['E05.599.395'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.750.750'], ['B01.050.500.091.657'], ['F01.145.113.111.600', 'F01.145.113.252.520']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

A chart analysis was completed and Fisher's exact test and independent t test were used in comparing patient outcomes.RESULTS: Ten women received dose-dense chemotherapy, received every 2 weeks, and 99 women received conventional chemotherapy, received with at least 3-week intervals, for breast cancer during pregnancy. Birth weight, gestational age at delivery, rate of growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and incidence of maternal and neonatal neutropenia were not statistically different between the two groups.CONCLUSION: In the small cohort of women in our registry, dose-dense chemotherapy does not appear to increase the risk of fetal or maternal complications.","['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Birth Weight', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Medical Staff, Hospital', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",23168749,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['C23.888.144.186', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.186', 'E05.041.124.160.750.149', 'G07.100.100.160.120.186', 'G07.345.249.314.120.186'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['D02.455.526.728.650.730.243', 'D02.705.672.500.243'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['G07.345.500.325.235.968', 'G08.686.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['M01.526.485.630.490', 'M01.526.485.740.422', 'N02.360.630.490', 'N02.360.740.422'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C04.850', 'C13.703.720'], ['E01.789.700', 'G08.686.784.769.496'], ['C13.703.824.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
16874,Clinic visit frequency in wound care matters: data from the US wound registry.,"OBJECTIVE: A previous study suggested that the frequency with which patients visit wound care clinics influences the rate of chronic wound healing but high bias was present with regard to wound care centre selection. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to confirm this finding by using a very large sample size of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) from the US Wound Registry.METHOD: Patients who visited the clinic more than once for a new DFU were eligible for study inclusion. No exclusion was made with regard to Wagner grade, wound severity, or patient comorbidity. A Cox regression was conducted to analyse time to heal within 1 year using covariates known or suspected to influence wound healing, including visit frequency.RESULTS: In terms of relative effect size, covariates that impeded wound healing the most were wound age and visit frequency with lower visit frequencies associated with lower probabilities of wound healing. Compared with DFUs (n=39,750) seen at a frequency of 7.5 times or more per 4 weeks, wounds seen at intervals of 2 weeks or less had a hazard ratio of 0.098 [(95% confidence interval: 0.09-0.11]. Using a separate breakpoint of ?2 versus < 2 per 4 weeks specifically for the estimate of overall effect size, Cohen's w was 0.14-a small-to-medium effect size.CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm previous work and have implications for clinical practice and analysis of uncontrolled studies.","['Ambulatory Care', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diabetic Foot', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'United States', 'Wound Healing']",28105899,"[['E02.760.106', 'N02.421.585.106'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C14.907.320.191', 'C17.800.893.592.450.200', 'C19.246.099.500.191', 'C19.246.099.937.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['G01.910.857'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
23398,Medical and social differences between French and migrant patients consulting for the first time for HIV infection.,"The objectives of the study were to describe the medical and social characteristics of patients consulting for the first time after diagnosis of HIV-infection and to compare the medical and social characteristics between French and migrant patients. From 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002, all consecutive adults consulting for the first time for HIV infection in two HIV outpatient clinics located in the western suburb of Paris, agreed to an interview based on an administered questionnaire regarding their medical and socioeconomic characteristics. Of the 203 patients (98 women, 105 men), one-third (n=70) was of French nationality. Delay (+/-SD) in access to HIV outpatient clinic after diagnosis was shorter in migrant than in French patients, respectively 7.6+/-29.6 months (median=0.5, range=0 to 196.6) and 23.8+/-51.4 months (median=0.9, range=0 to 199.7); p=0.005. There was no significant difference in the medical characteristics between the two groups of patients on their first consultation. However, most of the migrants were living in very poor socio-economic conditions with minimal resources thus sometimes delaying initiation of HAART. The development of social facilities for HIV-positive migrants should be a public health priority.","['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', 'France', 'HIV Infections', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Transients and Migrants']",16036237,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['F01.145.488'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['M01.920']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
35853,Budd-Chiari syndrome.,"UNLABELLED: A 16-year-old Ethiopian male patient presented with 18 months history of anasarca, anemia & hepatomegaly associated with hypoprothrombinemia, and diagnosed to have Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). The patient responded markedly to medical therapy with diuretics, anticoagulation and salt restriction. The clinical features and treatment of BCS is briefly reviewed and discussed.INTRODUCTION: BCS is a rare disorder resulting from obstruction to the outflow of blood from the liver. It results from occlusion or partial occlusion of one, two, or all three of the major hepatic veins and/or occlusion or partial occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The clinical diagnosis is difficult and Radiology plays a critical role for diagnosis and classification. Type I is occlusion of the IVC with/without hepatic veins, type II is occlusion of major hepatic veins with/without IVC, and type III is occlusion of small centrilobar veins.","['Adolescent', 'Anticoagulants', 'Budd-Chiari Syndrome', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hepatomegaly', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler', 'Vena Cava, Inferior']",20608021,"[['M01.060.057'], ['D27.505.954.502.119'], ['C06.552.347', 'C14.907.355.830.925.275'], ['E02.186'], ['E01.171'], ['C06.552.416', 'C23.300.775.525'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.210.450.150.875', 'D01.857.650'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.350.850.850'], ['A07.015.908.949.648']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
45959,High glucose environment induces M1 macrophage polarization that impairs keratinocyte migration via TNF-á: An important mechanism to delay the diabetic wound healing.,"BACKGROUND: Macrophages play important roles during wound healing, and delayed healing in diabetics is associated with sustained inflammation. M1 type macrophage is recognized to secrete excessive amount of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-á) as compared to its M2 counterpart.OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that macrophage polarization is different between diabetic and normal rats during skin wounding and has direct impact on keratinocyte function in the context of re-epithelialization.METHODS: Skin wounds were created in diabetic and control rats. The phenotypes of infiltrating macrophages, the levels of TNF-á, and the rate of wound closure were determined. Using cell model, the effects of M1 type macrophage on keratinocyte migration were evaluated, and the potential regulatory pathways were determined.RESULTS: The percentage of M1 macrophages and the levels of TNF-á expression were significantly higher in the perilesional area of diabetic rats as compared to control. The condition media (CM) from M1 type macrophage upregulated tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 expression in keratinocytes and significantly reduced keratinocyte migratory capacity. Addition of neutralizing TNF-á antibody to the CM or gene-silencing of TIMP1 in keratinocytes restored the keratinocyte migratory capacity. Treating wounds of diabetic rats with TNF-á antagonist improved the wound healing process.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, high glucose wound environment harbored more M1 macrophages infiltration, an event that created excess TNF-á micro-environment. TNF-á upregulated TIMP1 expression in keratinocytes and resulted in impaired keratinocyte migration. Taken together, these events contributed to impaired wound healing during diabetic condition, and targeting TNF-á is a potential therapeutic option to improve diabetic wound healing.","['Animals', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cell Movement', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Keratinocytes', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Re-Epithelialization', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",31761388,"[['B01.050'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['C18.452.394.750.074', 'C19.246.240', 'E05.598.500.374'], ['A11.409.500', 'A11.436.397'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['G04.753', 'G13.750.726', 'G16.762.891.750'], ['D12.776.645.875.450'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
11595,Examination of enamel-adhesive interface with focused ion beam and scanning electron microscopy.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to observe, with a scanning electron microscope, the interface between enamel and orthodontic adhesive after focused ion-beam milling. In addition, enamel etched with phosphoric acid was compared with enamel conditioned with self-etching primer.METHODS: Four freshly extracted human premolars were collected and pumiced by using rubber cups with fluoride-free paste, washed, and dried. The enamel of 2 teeth was etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 30 seconds, washed, and dried; the enamel of the other 2 teeth was conditioned with self-etching primer for 5 seconds. Stainless steel brackets were bonded with Transbond XT adhesive (3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specimens were milled by focused ion beam and observed under the scanning electron microscope.RESULTS: The scanning electron micrographs showed that 37% phosphoric acid seemed to produce more enamel loss than the self-etching primer. Moreover, the enamel-adhesive interface was more irregular when the enamel was etched with 37% phosphoric acid. Finally, a gentler etch pattern of the self-etching primer on the enamel surface was observed, and this conditioner could be used clinically for minimal intervention in the orthodontic bonding procedure.CONCLUSIONS: Focused ion-beam milling to prepare samples allowed clear observation of the enamel-adhesive interface without artificial damage.","['Acid Etching, Dental', 'Bicuspid', 'Dental Bonding', 'Dental Enamel', 'Dental Materials', 'Dentin-Bonding Agents', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Orthodontic Brackets', 'Phosphoric Acids', 'Resin Cements', 'Surface Properties']",17482085,"[['E06.931.475.111'], ['A14.549.167.860.150'], ['E06.095'], ['A14.549.167.900.255'], ['D25.339', 'D27.720.102.339', 'J01.637.051.339'], ['D25.339.291.300', 'J01.637.051.339.291.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['E06.658.453.255.500'], ['D01.029.260.700.675', 'D01.695.625.675'], ['D05.750.716.822.730', 'D25.339.291.750', 'D25.720.716.822.730', 'J01.637.051.339.291.750', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.730'], ['G02.860']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
5629,Asymmetric retraction of growth cone filopodia following focal inactivation of calcineurin.,"The neuronal growth cone is thought to be the site of decision making in nerve growth and guidance. One likely mechanism of how the growth cone translates various extracellular cues into directed motility involves rises in intracellular calcium. A variety of physiological cues, such as adhesion molecules and neurotransmitters, increases intracellular calcium, and artificial manipulations of growth cone calcium levels affect growth cone morphology and neurite outgrowth. The molecular events downstream of calcium fluxes are incompletely understood. Here we show that calcineurin, a protein phosphatase enriched in growth cones that is dependent on calcium ions and calmodulin, functions in neurite outgrowth and directed filopodial motility in cultured chick dorsal root ganglia neurons. Cyclosporin A and FK506, inhibitors of calcineurin, delayed neuritogenesis and inhibited neurite extension. Chromophore-assisted laser inactivation of calcineurin in regions of growth cones causes localized filopodial and lamellipodial retraction and influences the direction of subsequent outgrowth. We suggest that a spatial distribution of calcineurin activity within the growth cone can regulate motility and direct outgrowth.","['Animals', 'Calcineurin', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Cyclosporine', 'Ganglia, Spinal', 'Lasers', 'Neurites', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases', 'Polyenes', 'Rosaniline Dyes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus', 'Tacrolimus']",7544441,"[['B01.050'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.625.150', 'D12.644.360.087', 'D12.776.476.087'], ['D12.776.157.142'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['A11.251'], ['A13.350.150', 'A16.331.200'], ['D04.345.566.235.300', 'D12.644.641.235.300'], ['A08.340.390.340', 'A08.800.350.340', 'A08.800.800.720.725.350'], ['E07.632.490', 'E07.710.520'], ['A08.675.256.500', 'A08.675.542.145.500', 'A11.284.180.610', 'A11.671.501.145.500', 'A11.671.543'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.625'], ['D02.455.326.271.665'], ['D02.092.146.755'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D02.540.505.760'], ['D02.540.505.810']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27912,Satisfaction and treatment adherence in erectile dysfunction in the medium and long term.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to show the satisfaction and treatment adherence in erectile dysfunction (ED) in the medium and long term.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive, comparative study was conducted in 2 centres through telephone interviews with patients who came for an initial visit between 2012 and 2014 for ED. A complete case history review was conducted on the use of and withdrawal from treatment. For current use, the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) and the Global Assessment Questionnaire (GAQ) were filled out; for past use, only the GAQ was filled out. For the statistical analysis, we employed Fisher's exact test for comparisons of percentages and the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare means.RESULTS: The study included 250 patients; 20.8% were prescribed intraurethral alprostadil (ALP-IU), 17.2% were prescribed intracavernous alprostadil (ALP-IC), 92.8% were prescribed a first IPD5, and 24.8% were prescribed at least a second IPD5. The treatment withdrawal rate was 62.07% for the first IPD5, 41.94% for the last IPD5, 69.23% for the ALP-IU and 65.11% for the ALP-IC (P=.007). The main reason for withdrawal for the IPD5 was a lack of response (32.76% of those who took IPD5). In addition to withdrawal, there were adverse reactions for ALP-IU and ALP-IC (28.85% and 11.63%, respectively). The mean duration of use until withdrawal was 4.3 months for IPD5, 2.2 months for ALP-IU and 5.5 months for ALP-IC (P=.064). The most favourable GAQ and EDITS scores were observed for IPD5 (EDITS score of 74). Sildenafil and tadalafil had the longest usage times (mean >5 months).CONCLUSIONS: The withdrawal rate for treating ED is high, with short usage times of a few months. A lack of response and adverse reactions were the main causes for withdrawal. The drugs that provide greater satisfaction are the IPD5, although there are no significant differences in the mean usage time between the different types and in aspects such as the mean usage time to withdrawal or the withdrawal rates.","['Alprostadil', 'Erectile Dysfunction', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors', 'Self Report', 'Time Factors']",27865471,"[['D10.251.355.255.550.250.100', 'D10.251.355.325.050', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.100'], ['C12.294.644.486', 'F03.835.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.100.150.750.500.600.500', 'F01.145.488.887.500.600.500', 'N05.300.150.800.500.600.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['D27.505.519.389.735.500'], ['E05.318.308.980.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.500'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40049,"Light physical activity determined by a motion sensor decreases insulin resistance, improves lipid homeostasis and reduces visceral fat in high-risk subjects: PreDiabEx study RCT.","OBJECTIVE: To examine physical activity (PA) thresholds affecting glucose, insulin and lipid concentrations and body fat composition in high-risk patients for type 2 diabetes (T2D).INTERVENTION: A total of 113 subjects of both genders having abnormal glucose levels in the oral glucose tolerance test were contacted. A total of 78 subjects with age 58.8±10.4 years and body mass index 31.7±5.3 kg m(-2) were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. INTERVENTION consisted of a supervised walking (60 min three times weekly) for 3 months. All the subjects received standard care for PA and weight reduction and wore an accelerometer during the whole wakeful time.RESULTS: Over 80% of the daily steps clustered at an acceleration level of 0.3-0.7 g (2-3 km h(-1) of walking) and were 5870 in the intervention and 4434 in the control group (P<0.029). Between 0 and 3 months no significant changes were observed in fasting and 2-h glucose, body weight or maximal oxygen uptake. In contrast, changes in fasting and 2-h insulin (-3.4 mU l(-1), P=0.035 and -26.6, P=0.003, respectively), homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (-1.0, P=0.036), total cholesterol (-0.55 mmol l(-1), P=0.041), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (-0.36 mmol l(-1), P=0.008) and visceral fat area (-5.5 cm(2), P=0.030) were significantly greater in the intervention than in control subjects. The overall effects of PA were analyzed by quartiles of daily steps of all subjects. There were significant reductions in total and LDL cholesterol and visceral fat area between the highest (daily steps over 6520) and the lowest quartile (1780-2810 daily steps). The changes associated with PA remained significant after adjustments of baseline, sex, age and body weight change.CONCLUSION: Habitual and structured PAs with the acceleration levels of 0.3-0.7 g and daily steps over 6520, equivalent to walking at 2-3 km h(-1) for 90 min daily, standing for the relative PA intensity of 30-35% of the maximal oxygen uptake, are clinically beneficial for overweight/obese and physically inactive individuals with a high risk for T2D.","['Blood Glucose', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Finland', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intra-Abdominal Fat', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Walking', 'Weight Loss']",24285336,"[['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['E02.760.169.063.500.387', 'E02.779.483', 'E02.831.535.483'], ['Z01.542.816.186'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.355', 'E01.370.374.355', 'E05.200.124.100.355'], ['G07.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452.394.968.500', 'G07.690.773.984.617'], ['A10.165.114.830.500.500'], ['G03.458'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['F01.145.699'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['G11.427.410.568.900', 'G11.427.410.698.277.937', 'I03.350.937', 'I03.450.642.845.940'], ['C23.888.144.243.963', 'G07.345.249.314.120.200.963']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

The sensitivity of cells continuously exposed to DATHF was not influenced by FPGS activity. After short term exposure to DATHF, cells expressing higher levels of human FPGS were more sensitive to the drug while cells expressing low levels were resistant. Cells expressing E. coli FPGS solely in the cytosol were resistant to DATHF and accumulated only low levels of the drug. Expression of E. coli FPGS in the mitochondria of these cells restored drug sensitivity and cytosolic drug accumulation. DATHF is extensively metabolized in the mitochondria of mammalian cells and, despite an inability to enter the mitochondria, folylpolyglutamates and DATHF polyglutamates formed in the mitochondria are released into the cytosol without prior hydrolysis. DATHF was not solely an inhibitor of de novo purine biosynthesis but also inhibited glycine synthesis in the cell.","['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cricetinae', 'Escherichia coli', 'Glutamates', 'Glycine', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines', 'Mitochondria', 'Peptide Synthases', 'Pyrimidines', 'Tetrahydrofolates', 'Thymidine', 'Transfection']",8144562,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210.200', 'A11.436.155'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['G04.346'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D12.125.067.625', 'D12.125.119.409'], ['D12.125.481'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.759.758.399.475'], ['D03.633.100.759.758.399'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['D08.811.464.259.850'], ['D03.383.742'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.400.800', 'D08.211.840'], ['D03.383.742.680.705', 'D13.570.230.855', 'D13.570.685.705'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

7788,Mepolizumab for severe eosinophilic asthma: a real-world snapshot on clinical markers and timing of response.,"Background: Few studies have provided real-world evidence of mepolizumab efficacy and safety. We aimed to evaluate mepolizumab for severe eosinophilic asthma in daily clinical practice.Research design and methods: Patients included in the RINOVA (Interdisciplinary Network for the management of severe asthma in Veneto region, Italy) database were investigated. Blood eosinophil count, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, % of predicted (FEV1%), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), asthma control test (ACT), oral steroid (OCS) intake, and exacerbation rate were evaluated during mepolizumab treatment.Results: 69 patients were enrolled (mean age: 55.1 years; 60.9% females). A significant improvement was detected at one month with respect to blood eosinophils (median level at baseline: 710/ìl; -620/ìl, p < 0,001), FEV1% (median value at baseline 87; range: 79-101; +4, p = 0.001) and ACT (median value at baseline 18; range: 14-20.5;+4, <0.001). A significant reduction of FeNO was observed six months after the treatment start, when the exacerbation rate and the mean OCS dose significantly decreased (respectively: Ä reduction -3; p < 0.001 and -5 mg; p < 0.001).Conclusions: Our study provides real-world evidence of mepolizumab safety and confirms its dramatic steroid sparing effect.

20343,Mimetics of caloric restriction include agonists of lipid-activated nuclear receptors.,"The obesity epidemic in industrialized countries is associated with increases in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and certain types of cancer. In animal models, caloric restriction (CR) suppresses these diseases as well as chemical-induced tissue damage. These beneficial effects of CR overlap with those altered by agonists of nuclear receptors (NR) under control of the fasting-responsive transcriptional co-activator, peroxisome proliferator-activated co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha). In a screen for compounds that mimic CR effects in the liver, we found statistically significant overlaps between the CR transcript profile in wild-type mice and the profiles altered by agonists of lipid-activated NR, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), liver X receptor, and their obligate heterodimer partner, retinoid X receptor. The overlapping genes included those involved in CVD (lipid metabolism and inflammation) and cancer (cell fate). Based on this overlap, we hypothesized that some effects of CR are mediated by PPARalpha. As determined by transcript profiling, 19% of all gene expression changes in wild-type mice were dependent on PPARalpha, including Cyp4a10 and Cyp4a14, involved in fatty acid omega-oxidation, acute phase response genes, and epidermal growth factor receptor but not increases in PGC-1alpha. CR protected the livers of wild-type mice from damage induced by thioacetamide, a liver toxicant and hepatocarcinogen. CR protection was lost in PPARalpha-null mice due to inadequate tissue repair. These results demonstrate that PPARalpha mediates some of the effects of CR and indicate that a pharmacological approach to mimicking many of the beneficial effects of CR may be possible.","['Animals', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Homeostasis', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Liver', 'Liver X Receptors', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Orphan Nuclear Receptors', 'PPAR alpha', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Risk Factors', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors']",15302862,"[['B01.050'], ['E02.642.249.200', 'G07.203.650.240.340.150'], ['C14'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G07.410'], ['G03.458'], ['A03.620'], ['D12.776.260.531', 'D12.776.826.194'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['D12.776.260.643', 'D12.776.826.209', 'D12.776.930.645'], ['D12.776.826.239.500'], ['D12.644.360.024.314.650', 'D12.776.157.057.080.650', 'D12.776.157.725.813.875', 'D12.776.476.024.394.650', 'D12.776.660.675.650', 'D12.776.664.962.813.875', 'D12.776.930.617.650'], ['D12.776.826'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['D12.776.260.755', 'D12.776.930.900', 'D12.776.964.925.984'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Only 4 hair pullers (36%) reported both rising tension and relief with hair pulling. Each group had significantly more internalizing than externalizing symptoms on the CBCL. Seven hair pullers (64%) had a lifetime history of at least one other axis I diagnosis. The results provide further evidence that trichotillomania in referred children and adolescents is usually a chronic disorder often associated with internalizing symptoms and psychiatric comorbidity.

46403,Alterations in 32P-labelled intermediates during flux activation of human platelet glycolysis.,"Using a newly developed isotopic tracer technique for the measurement of 32P-labelled intermediates in glycolysis and nucleotide metabolism in platelets, we studied the variations in 32P-labelled intermediates during activation of the glycolytic flux by cyanide and platelet-activating agents. The major variations occurred in [32P]Fru-1,6-P2, dihydroxy acetone phosphate, ATP and Pi. There was a quantitative covariance between the increase in lactate production and the rise in [32P]Fru-1,6-P2 induced by different platelet-activating agents. In contrast, cyanide induced weaker activation of the flux and greater accumulation of [32P]Fru-1,6-P2. Variations in 32P-labelled intermediates were apparent 5 s after flux activation, but the major changes in [32P]Fru-1,6-P2 occurred much later and fell in periods in which a constant lactate formation was maintained. The cyanide-induced changes in 32P-labelled intermediates depended on the extracellular level of glucose, showing a predominant ATP----Pi conversion in glucose-depleted medium that shifted to an ATP----Fru-1,6-P2 conversion at excess glucose. At about 50 microM glucose, flux activation occurred without major changes in [32P]Fru-1,6-P2, dihydroxy acetone phosphate and Pi, with only a small fall in [32P]ATP. The data provide evidence for a role of the aldolase reaction in flux control and demonstrate rapid changes in Fru-1,6-P2 and ATP during flux activation with an additional role for Fru-1,6-P2 as an energy buffer during post-activation periods.","['Adenosine Diphosphate', 'Blood Platelets', 'Calcimycin', 'Collagen', 'Cyanides', 'Epinephrine', 'Fructosediphosphates', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Lactates', 'Lactic Acid', 'Phosphates', 'Thrombin']",6437451,"[['D03.633.100.759.646.138.124', 'D13.695.667.138.124', 'D13.695.827.068.124'], ['A11.118.188', 'A15.145.229.188'], ['D03.633.100.221.173'], ['D05.750.078.280', 'D12.776.860.300.250'], ['D01.248.497.158.291', 'D01.625.400.100'], ['D02.033.100.291.310', 'D02.092.063.291.310', 'D02.092.211.215.454', 'D02.092.311.461', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.461'], ['D09.894.417.313.300', 'D09.894.417.592.300'], ['G02.111.158.750', 'G03.191.750', 'G03.295.436', 'G03.493.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.241.511.459'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374', 'D01.248.497.158.730', 'D01.695.625.675.650'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.855', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.855', 'D12.776.124.125.890', 'D23.119.960']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
42534,Repetitive naming and the detection of word retrieval deficits in the beginning reader.,"The claim has been advanced that children with severe reading disability are generally deficient in word retrieval compared with normal readers. Support for the claim is based largely on studies of rapid naming of repetitively presented pictured objects or other nameable stimuli, a task which is apparently more sensitive to retrieval problems than the confrontation naming of items presented singly. The purpose of this study was to examine whether there is a general relationship between word retrieval speed and reading ability in beginning readers. Although such a relationship has not been detected with confrontation naming, repetitive naming may provide a more sensitive test. Accordingly, second-grade children were required to name as rapidly as possible repeated presentations of five pictured items drawn from a single category. Separate naming tests were made for objects, colors, animals, letters, and words. The results showed that there was no relationship between reading ability and naming times when the test items were selected from sets of objects, colors, or animals, whereas on letters and words, a significant relationship was found. The less-skilled readers were not, therefore, consistently slower in all repetitive naming situations. Instead their word retrieval deficits extended only to the orthographic materials.","['Child', 'Color Perception', 'Humans', 'Memory', 'Mental Recall', 'Pattern Recognition, Visual', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Semantics', 'Verbal Learning']",4092487,"[['M01.060.406'], ['F02.463.593.932.217'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425.540'], ['F02.463.425.540.641'], ['F02.463.593.524.500', 'F02.463.593.932.622'], ['E05.796.817', 'F02.830.650', 'F04.669.817', 'G11.561.677'], ['L01.559.423.557'], ['L01.559.598.745'], ['F02.463.425.952']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

28806,Solubilizing effects caused by alkyl pyridinium surfactants in phosphatidylcholine liposomes.,"The solubilization of neutral and electrically charged liposomes by a series of alkyl pyridinium surfactants (alkyl chain lengths C10-C14) was investigated. Solubilization was detected as a decrease in static light-scattering of liposome suspensions. Two parameters were regarded as corresponding to the effective surfactant/lipid molar ratios at which the surfactant saturated the liposomes Re(sat) and led to a complete solubilization of these structures Re(sol). From these parameters the corresponding surfactant partition coefficients were determined. The Re and K parameters fell as the surfactant alkyl chain length decreased or both the critical micellar concentration (CMC) and the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB number) increased, regardless of the bilayers electrical charge. Thus, although decyl-pyridinium bromide (DePB) showed the highest ability for saturation and solubilization of bilayers, its concentration was always higher than that needed for dodecyl-pyridinium bromide (DoPB) and tetradecyl-pyridinium bromide (TePB), the last one being the most active. These results emphasize the influence of the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance of these surfactants on liposome solubilization and the minor influence of the electrostatic factors in this process.","['Amines', 'Light', 'Liposomes', 'Phosphatidic Acids', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Pyridinium Compounds', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Solubility', 'Surface-Active Agents']",7586094,"[['D02.092'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['D25.479.517', 'D26.255.260.517', 'J01.637.051.479.517', 'J01.637.087.500.517'], ['D10.570.755.375.760'], ['D10.570.755.375.760.400.800'], ['D03.383.725.762'], ['E05.196.822', 'G01.867'], ['G02.805'], ['D27.720.877']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
37778,Improved understanding of the bacterial vaginal microbiota of women before and after probiotic instillation.,"The vaginal bacterial microbiota of 19 premenopausal women was examined by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of the V2-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Ten of the women were studied further to investigate the effect and persistence of vaginally inserted capsules containing viable lactobacilli. PCR-DGGE indicated that most subjects had a microbiota represented by one to three dominant DNA fragments. Analysis of these fragments revealed that 79% of the women possessed sequences with high levels of similarity to Lactobacillus species sequences. Sequences homologous to Lactobacillus iners sequences were the most common and were detected in 42% of the women tested. Alteration of the vaginal microbiota could be detected by PCR-DGGE in several women after the instillation of lactobacilli. Additionally, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis of lactobacilli isolated from selective media demonstrated that the exogenous strains could be detected for up to 21 days in some subjects. This study demonstrates that non-culture-based techniques, such as PCR-DGGE, are useful adjuncts for studies of the vaginal microbiota.","['Adult', 'Bacteria', 'Culture Media', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Genes, rRNA', 'Humans', 'Lactobacillus', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Premenopause', 'Probiotics', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Vagina']",12513982,"[['M01.060.116'], ['B03'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.645.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B03.353.750.450.475', 'B03.510.460.400.410.475.475', 'B03.510.550.450.475'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['G08.686.157.500.812', 'G08.686.841.249.500.812'], ['G07.203.300.456.500', 'J02.500.456.500'], ['D13.444.735.686.670'], ['E05.393.620.500.687', 'E05.601.700'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['A05.360.319.779']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

36854,The cyclopean eye and its implications: vergence state and visual direction.,"The cyclopean illusion (Hering, 1861) is an anomalous lateral shift in the apparent direction to a monocularly seen target, which arises when a change in vergence is made by the opposite (nonobserving) eye. Surprisingly, this directional illusion does not arise, when the observed target is an afterimage or an intermittently illuminated (4-8 Hz) object. Instead, during convergence, a monocularly imprinted afterimage seems to move toward the observer, and a stroboscopically illuminated target seems to remain fully stationary. The apparent displacement of an afterimage in depth is particularly puzzling. Since binocular interactions in the persistence of monocularly induced afterimages can be demonstrated, it is conceivable that long-persistent afterimages arise, in part, from binocularly driven neurons in the visual cortex, and that a monocularly induced afterimage can thereby become the perceptual equivalent of a binocularly fused target.","['Afterimage', 'Eye Movements', 'Humans', 'Vision, Binocular', 'Visual Cortex']",3250087,"[['F02.463.593.932.073', 'G14.040'], ['G11.427.410.140', 'G14.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.593.932.885'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.571.735', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.814.953']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25954,Microprocessor in controlled transdermal drug delivery of anti-cancer drugs.,"Microprocessor controlled transdermal delivery of anticancer drugs 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) was developed and in vitro evaluation was done. Drugs were loaded based on the pharmacokinetics parameters. In vitro diffusion studies were carried at different current density (0.0, 0.1, 0.22, 0.50 mA/cm2). The patches were evaluated for the drug content, thickness, weight, folding endurance, flatness, thumb tack test and adhesive properties all were well with in the specification of transdermal patches with elegant and transparent in appearance. In vitro permeation studies through human cadaver skin showed, passive delivery (0.0 mA/cm2) of 6-MP was low. As the current density was progressively increased, the flux also increased. the flux also increased with 0.1 mA/cm2 for 15-20 min, but it was less than desired flux, 0.2 mA/cm2 for 30 min showed better flux than 0.1 mA/cm2 current, but lag time was more than 4 h, 0.5 mA/cm2 current for more than 1 h, flux was >159 microg/cm2 h which was desired flux for 6-MP. 5-FU flux reached the minimum effective concentration (MEC) of 54 microg/cm2 h with 0.5 mA/cm2 current for 30-45 min, drug concentration were within the therapeutic window in post-current phase. We concluded from Ohm's Law that as the resistance decreases, current increases. Skin resistance decrease with increase in time and current, increase in the drug permeation. Interestingly, for all investigated current densities, as soon as the current was switched off, 5-FU and 6-MP flux decreased fairly, but the controlled drug delivery can be achieved by switching the current for required period of time.","['Administration, Cutaneous', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cadaver', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electric Impedance', 'Fluorouracil', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine', 'Microcomputers', 'Skin', 'Skin Absorption']",18592348,"[['E02.319.267.120.060'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['C23.550.260.224'], ['D26.255.210', 'E02.319.300.253'], ['G01.202', 'G02.196'], ['E02.319.300'], ['G01.358.500.249.277.350'], ['D03.383.742.698.875.404'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.886.489.534', 'D03.633.100.759.570'], ['L01.224.230.260.550'], ['A17.815'], ['G03.015.500.750', 'G03.787.024.500.750', 'G07.690.725.015.500.750', 'G13.750.778']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

402,Bodily embarrassment and judgment concern as separable factors in the measurement of medical embarrassment: psychometric development and links to treatment-seeking outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding why people do not always engage in medical examinations that might benefit them is a public health issue which is receiving increased attention. One area of promise involves the study of medical embarrassment, although current studies are weakened in that they measure medical embarrassment in a theoretically na?ve and unidimensional manner and have assumed that embarrassment is exclusively a barrier to the timely seeking of treatment.DESIGN: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 116 male and 134 female students (mean age = 19.94 years, 47.2% Caucasian, 20.4% African-American, 32.4% Asian) from two large universities in different parts of the United States.METHODS: Participants completed a comprehensive measure of medical embarrassment, reported on previous treatment avoidance because of embarrassment, and recorded the frequency of psychological, general and sex-related visits across the previous 5 years.RESULTS: As expected, medical embarrassment was not unidimensional and appeared to have two distinct factors--bodily embarrassment and judgment concern. Bodily embarrassment generally predicted less frequent medical contact although not equally so across domains and it interacted with judgment concern in several cases, providing preliminary evidence that there are situations in which aspects of medical embarrassment may actually facilitate greater medical contact.CONCLUSIONS: The data highlight the importance of considering the role of emotions other than fear in health behaviour and the means by which they may facilitate or deter the timely seeking of diagnosis and treatment.","['Adult', 'Attitude to Health', 'Body Image', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Judgment', 'Male', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Shame', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Treatment Outcome']",17640455,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.100.150', 'N05.300.150'], ['F01.752.747.792.110', 'F02.463.593.112'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.785.626'], ['F01.100.150.750.500', 'F01.145.488.887.500', 'N05.300.150.800.500'], ['F04.096.628'], ['F04.711.780'], ['F01.470.483.666'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
43404,Direct fluorometric detection of paramagnetic and heavy metal ions at sub-amol level using an aromatic polyaminocarboxylate by CZE: Combination of pre- and on-capillary complexation technique.,"The low sensitivity of simple CZE for detecting metal ions is a long-standing problem even when an LIF detection system is employed. We have successfully achieved an ultrasensitive CE-LIF using a simple CZE mode (typical detection limit: 10(-11)-10(-10) mol/dm(3)). Both the design of a newly synthesized ligand and the combination of a precapillary derivatizing technique with an on-capillary ternary complexing technique have enabled us to achieve this extremely low LOD and high resolution of large metal complexes. The direct fluorescent detection of the paramagnetic metal ions was achieved for the first time despite their intrinsic fluorescent quenching nature. The fluorescent ligand (L) consists of a polyaminocarboxylate chelating moiety, a strongly emissive fluorescein moiety and a spacer connecting the two portions. The migration behavior of various metal-L complexes was investigated. The resolution among the complexes was improved by the introduction of a ternary complex equilibrium of the kinetically stable mother complexes with OH(-) ion. The analytical potential of our simple system was examined, and it was proved that the system was one of the most sensitive methods without the need for any preconcentration process.","['Calcium', 'Edetic Acid', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Environment', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorometry', 'Ions', 'Ligands', 'Magnetics', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",17577884,"[['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D02.092.782.258.368.250', 'D02.241.081.018.253'], ['E05.196.401.190', 'E05.301.300.190'], ['G16.500.275', 'N06.230'], ['D02.455.426.779.347', 'D03.633.300.953.275', 'D04.711.347'], ['E05.196.712.516.600'], ['D01.248.497'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['H01.671.493'], ['D01.268.556', 'D01.552.544'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
48702,"Effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on humoral immunity: I. Similarities to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan Strain I (SAC) in the in vitro T-dependent antibody response.","We have determined that suppression of the in vitro T-dependent humoral immune response by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is dependent on the type and concentration of serum used in the culture media. Only five out of 23 commercial lots of serum (screened at both 5 and 10%) could support a suppression in the presence of 30 nM TCDD, with the remaining lots demonstrating an apparent 'protective-like' effect against the TCDD exposure. When log dose response curves were established with TCDD (0.3, 3.0, and 30 nM) in media containing each of the serum lots supporting a suppression (at both 5 and 10%), we determined that only three lots could support a full dose-responsive suppression. Subsequently, in a comparison study between the effects of TCDD and the polyclonal B-cell activator Staphylococcus aureus Cowan Strain I (SAC) on the in vitro T-dependent humoral immune response, we have found that SAC suppresses the antibody response to SRBC and demonstrates the same serum dependency for this effect as was previously noted for TCDD. Under serum-free culturing conditions, TCDD (30 nM) caused a 15-fold increase in the AFC response to SRBCs over controls, suggesting that direct addition of TCDD to whole splenocyte cultures in the absence of serum-derived growth factors results in an increase in B-cell activation. Likewise, under serum-free conditions, SAC dose-dependently increased the AFC response over media controls, and at doses which achieved the same degree of suppression of the humoral response aa TCDD. Taken together, these studies suggest that TCDD has actions that are similar to a T cell independent polyclonal B cell activator such as SAC, and selectively acts on the B cell to suppress the T-dependent humoral immune response by a mechanism which is unique to this series of compounds. This effect however, is only detectable under appropriate serum-supported (or serum-deficient) culture conditions as described.","['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1917438,"[['B01.050'], ['G12.450.050.370.250'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['E05.481'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D02.309.500.450', 'D03.633.300.786'], ['B03.300.390.400.800.750.100', 'B03.353.500.750.750.100', 'B03.510.100.750.750.100', 'B03.510.400.790.750.100'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
47191,"Chlorpropamide 2-hydroxylation is catalysed by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 in vitro: chlorpropamide disposition is influenced by CYP2C9, but not by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism.","AIMS: We evaluated the involvement of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 2C9 and 2C19 in chlorpropamide 2-hydroxylation in vitro and in chlorpropamide disposition in vivo.METHODS: To identify CYP isoforms(s) that catalyse 2-hydroxylation of chlorpropamide, the incubation studies were conducted using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP isoforms. To evaluate whether genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C19 influence the disposition of chlorpropamide, a single oral dose of 250 mg chlorpropamide was administered to 21 healthy subjects pregenotyped for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.RESULTS: In human liver microsomal incubation studies, the formation of 2-hydroxychlorpropamide (2-OH-chlorpropamide), a major chlorpropamide metabolite in human, has been best described by a one-enzyme model with estimated K(m) and V(max) of 121.7 +/- 19.9 microm and 16.1 +/- 5.0 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively. In incubation studies using human recombinant CYP isoforms, however, 2-OH-chlorpropamide was formed by both CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 with similar intrinsic clearances (CYP2C9 vs. CYP2C19: 0.26 vs. 0.22 microl min(-1) nmol(-1) protein). Formation of 2-OH-chlorpropamide in human liver microsomes was significantly inhibited by sulfaphenazole, but not by S-mephenytoin, ketoconazole, quinidine, or furafylline. In in vivo clinical trials, eight subjects with the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype exhibited significantly lower nonrenal clearance [*1/*3 vs.*1/*1: 1.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.1 ml h(-1) kg(-1), P < 0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) on the difference 0.2, 1.0] and higher metabolic ratios (of chlorpropamide/2-OH-chlorpropamide in urine: *1/*3 vs.*1/*1: 1.01 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.08, P < 0.05; 95% CI on the difference - 0.9, - 0.1) than did 13 subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype. In contrast, no differences in chlorpropamide pharmacokinetics were observed for subjects with the CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer vs. poor metabolizer genotypes.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that chlorpropamide disposition is principally determined by CYP2C9 activity in vivo, although both CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 have a catalysing activity of chlorpropamide 2-hydroxylation pathway.","['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases', 'Chlorpropamide', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxylation', 'Hypoglycemic Agents', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Microsomes', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",15842554,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D08.244.453.005', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.010', 'D12.776.422.220.453.010'], ['D02.065.950.828.283', 'D02.886.590.795.283'], ['D08.244.453.491.500.700', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.450.500.700', 'D12.776.422.220.453.491.500.700'], ['D08.244.453.491.500.500', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.450.500.500', 'D12.776.422.220.453.491.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.385', 'G02.607.348', 'G03.425'], ['D27.505.696.422'], ['A03.620'], ['A11.284.835.540'], ['D08.811.682.690.708'], ['G05.365.795']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
33496,[Ability to conceive and the course of pregnancy in women after laparoscopic myomectomy].,"The aim of the study was to assess fertility of patients after myomectomy. The study included a group of 32 patients, aged 22-41, who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. Primary infertility was diagnosed in 23 women (71.8%), whereas secondary infertility in 9 women (28.2%). Indications for surgery were rapid growth of myoma during last year and intramural myoma > 3 cm in diameter. The incision of the uterus and removal of myomas was made with harmonic scalpel. The average diameter of the largest myoma was 5.6 cm (range 3-11 cm). The number of myomas observed during operation ranged from 1 to 6. No conversion to laparotomy was performed. The average operation time was 85 min (range 60-185 min). After the operation 13 patients became pregnant, which constitutes 40.6%. Pregnancy ended with birth at term in 9 patients (28.1%), spontaneous abortion occurred in 4 patients (12.5%). Three-dimensional ultrasonography was performed after miscarriage and normal uterine cavity was observed. No obstetric complications were diagnosed in women who conceived. The main conclusions of the study are: 1. Uterine myomas constitute one of the significant causes of infertility and myomectomy using laparoscopy increases the chance of pregnancy. 2. Laparoscopy seems to be a promising and feasible method of myomectomy in women at reproductive age.","['Adult', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Gynecologic Surgical Procedures', 'Humans', 'Infertility', 'Laparoscopy', 'Myoma', 'Pregnancy']",15230143,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G08.686.210'], ['E04.950.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.294.365', 'C13.351.500.365'], ['E01.370.388.250.520', 'E04.502.250.520'], ['C04.557.450.590.540'], ['G08.686.784.769']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
17350,Influence of chemotherapeutic agents and cytokines on the expression of 5-fluorouracil-associated enzymes in human colon cancer cell lines.,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that intratumoral expression of catabolizing and anabolizing enzymes for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is important in the response of cancers to 5-FU-based chemotherapy. We investigated the influence of other chemotherapeutic agents or cytokines, which are often administered for enhancing the efficacy of 5-FU, on the tumoral expression of 5-FU-associated enzymes, i.e., dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), thymidylate synthase (TS), orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT), and thymidine phosphorylase (TP).METHODS: Human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29, Caco-2, and DLD-1) were incubated with 5-FU and with 5-FU combined with cisplatin, camptothecin, paclitaxel, mitomycin C, interferon, or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. mRNA expression of 5-FU-associated enzymes was assessed by real-time PCR. Activity of each enzyme and intracellular 5-FU accumulation after incubation with such agents were also evaluated.RESULTS: Each agent had a synergistic effect on the cytotoxicity of 5-FU. All chemotherapeutic agents other than cytokines induced marked alteration of the mRNA expression profile of 5-FU-associated enzymes; depression of DPD, elevation of TS, and slight suppression of OPRT and TP. In accordance with mRNA expression, enzyme activity of DPD was significantly depressed by such agents. Furthermore, although 5-FU itself increased DPD mRNA expression, a mechanism considered to be related to the acquisition of 5-FU resistance, the addition of cisplatin or camptothecin significantly inhibited the 5-FU-induced elevation of DPD.CONCLUSIONS: 5-FU-associated enzymes in colon cancer cells were greatly influenced by various chemotherapeutic agents; in particular, DPD expression was depressed. These results appear important in planning chemotherapy and also in understanding the development of adverse effects of 5-FU.","['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic', 'Apoptosis', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Camptothecin', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Cytokines', 'Dihydrouracil Dehydrogenase (NADP)', 'Fluorouracil', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferons', 'Ligands', 'Mitomycin', 'Orotate Phosphoribosyltransferase', 'Paclitaxel', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Thymidine Phosphorylase', 'Thymidylate Synthase']",16568373,"[['D27.505.519.186.144', 'D27.505.954.248.144', 'D27.888.569.042.030'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['A11.251.210.190.160', 'A11.251.860.180.160', 'A11.436.140'], ['D03.132.151'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['D01.210.375', 'D01.625.125', 'D01.710.100'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['D08.811.682.660.350'], ['D03.383.742.698.875.404'], ['A11.251.210.190.475', 'A11.251.860.180.475', 'A11.436.365'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.440', 'D12.776.467.374.440', 'D23.529.374.440'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['D02.806.400.249.350', 'D03.383.097.500.350', 'D03.633.100.473.412.249.350'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.700'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888.777', 'D02.455.849.291.850.777'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.850.500', 'D23.050.301.500.600.925', 'D23.050.705.552.600.850'], ['D08.811.913.555.500.862']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

During this period 15,060 minor cases and 9800 medium/major surgical procedures were performed and an arrest rate of 1:15,060 for minor cases and 1:251 for medium/major cases were obtained. The age ranged between one day and 65 years with a mean of 29.8 years and a male/female ratio of 1:1.3 as there were 18 males and 22 females. Twenty-five (62.5%) arrests occurred outside work hours while fifteen (37.5%) cases arrested during work hours. The surgical procedures with high arrest rates in this study were: emergency laparotomy 8 (20%), emergency caesarian sections 7 (17.5%), thoracotomy 6(15%), emergency craniotomy 5(12.5%), emergency hysterectomy 4(10%) and therapeutic bronchoscopy for foreign bodies in the airway 4(10%). The arrests occurred in 30(75%) emergency procedures as opposed to 10(25%) elective cases. Only in 3 out of the 18, 318 day case procedures did the patients arrest. One patient arrested during local infiltration of lignocaine while the other 39(97.5%) arrested under general anaesthesia. There was no arrest with spinal anaesthesia. The predisposing factors for a patient to arrest on the operating table in our environment include emergency major surgery, poor risk patients with ASA 111 and above, surgery performed outside work hours, under general anaesthesia administered by nurse anaesthetists or junior anaesthetic residents. The success rate at resuscitation is highest with patients with ASA 1 & 11, operations performed during work hours and by senior surgeons and anaesthetists.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cesarean Section', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Craniotomy', 'Developing Countries', 'Emergencies', 'Female', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Hysterectomy', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intraoperative Complications', 'Laparotomy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Population Surveillance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Thoracotomy', 'Time Factors', 'Tropical Medicine']",11391840,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.386.105', 'E01.370.388.250.100', 'E04.502.250.100', 'E04.928.600.080'], ['E04.520.252.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E04.525.190'], ['I01.615.500.300'], ['C23.550.291.781', 'N06.230.100.083', 'N06.850.376'], ['C14.280.383'], ['N02.278.020.300.310', 'N02.278.421.639.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E04.950.300.399'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['C23.550.505'], ['E04.406'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.058.290.190.565'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E04.928.760'], ['G01.910.857'], ['H02.403.879']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

27886,Concurrent changes in eccentric hamstring strength and knee joint kinematics induced by soccer-specific fatigue.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence of soccer-specific fatigue on concurrent changes in knee joint kinematics and hamstring strength, given the increased risk of injury during the latter stages of match-play and the prevalence of knee joint and hamstring muscular injury.DESIGN: Repeated measures, randomized order trials.SETTING: Laboratory.PARTICIPANTS: Ten male professional soccer players.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reactive inversion, eversion and neutral hop tasks were completed at 15 min intervals during a soccer-specific protocol, with touchdown knee joint kinematics in the frontal and sagittal planes calculated at 200 Hz. In a separate trial, players completed maximal eccentric knee flexions at 160°·s-1 (reflecting average knee angular velocity in the functional task) at 15 min intervals, quantifying peak torque.RESULTS: All trials were characterized by knee varus at touchdown, with ?4° greater mal-alignment elicited over the final 15 min of the protocol (P ? 0.05). Peak eccentric hamstring strength was significantly (P = 0.045) reduced throughout the 2nd half.CONCLUSIONS: The coincident impairment of eccentric hamstring strength and increased knee varus at touchdown predisposes the player to injury, supporting epidemiological observations.

This reaction is impractical to perform reproducibly in batch mode, yet is very simple to handle in a flow analysis system and uses a single, very long-lived reagent solution. Interference from common inorganic anions and organic phosphorus species was minimal, and good spike recoveries for a range of sample matrices were obtained. The proposed flow analysis system is characterised by a limit of detection of 1.3 ìg L(-1) P, linear range of 5-1000 ìg L(-1) P, dynamic range of 5-5000 ìg L(-1) P, repeatability of 0.8% (1000 ìg L(-1) P, n=10) and 5.6% (10 ìg L(-1) P, n=10), and sample throughput of 57 h(-1). It is expected that this method will improve the feasibility of autonomous long-term environmental monitoring of dissolved reactive phosphate using inexpensive apparatus.","['Environmental Monitoring', 'Equipment Design', 'Flow Injection Analysis', 'Limit of Detection', 'Molybdenum', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphates', 'Solubility', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Water']",25435242,"[['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['E05.320'], ['E05.196.460'], ['E05.318.740.872.374', 'N05.715.360.750.725.500', 'N06.850.520.830.872.500'], ['D01.268.556.555', 'D01.268.956.500', 'D01.552.544.555'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374', 'D01.248.497.158.730', 'D01.695.625.675.650'], ['G02.805'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

10704,Histological analysis of the Ankylos peri-implant soft tissues in a dog model.,"PURPOSE: The importance of the soft tissue-implant interface is enhanced by the presence of a microgap between the implant and the abutment, which represents a contamination site for bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the interface between the Ankylos gap-free implant system and the surrounding soft tissues in a dog model.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six Labrador dogs were included in the study and two Ankylos implants were inserted per dog. The dogs were killed 6 months after abutment placement without functional loading and without plaque control. The implants were analysed histologically by scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy, and histomorphometry.RESULTS: Some sections exhibited histologic signs of a mild inflammation. The connective tissue between the most apical epithelial cells of the junctional epithelium and the alveolar crest was characterized by collagen fibers running from the periosteum and the alveolar crest toward the oral epithelium and, in front of the cone-shaped abutment, by a narrow zone of extracellular matrix with a few collagen fibers.CONCLUSION: Compared with results obtained in other studies using different types of implant (Astra, Br?nemark, ITI), the Ankylos implant showed a higher length and a larger width of connective tissue contact as well as a shorter epithelial downgrowth. The absence of a microgap in the Ankylos system could explain the histologic mild inflammation in the connective tissue.","['Alveolar Process', 'Animals', 'Collagen', 'Connective Tissue', 'Dental Abutments', 'Dental Implants', 'Dental Prosthesis Design', 'Dogs', 'Epithelial Attachment', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Models, Animal', 'Periodontitis', 'Periodontium', 'Surface Properties']",14560487,"[['A02.835.232.781.324.502.125', 'A14.521.125', 'A14.549.167.646.094'], ['B01.050'], ['D05.750.078.280', 'D12.776.860.300.250'], ['A10.165'], ['E06.780.346.500', 'E07.695.190.175'], ['D25.339.312', 'E06.780.346.593', 'E07.695.185', 'J01.637.051.339.312'], ['E06.780.346.625', 'E06.912.145'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['A14.549.167.646.374'], ['A11.436'], ['A11.284.295.310'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['E05.598'], ['C07.465.714.533'], ['A14.549.167.646'], ['G02.860']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
39531,"[The search for an ""ideal"" surgical dressing].","Trials of a new occlusive dressing, Op-site (Smith Nephew), were conducted on a group of patients. Op-site is a fine, transparent, elastic, self-adhesive polyurethan film. Although non-porous and therefore water- and bacteria-proof, it is permeable to gases. The existing dressings fulfil only a few of the criteria of an ""ideal"" dressing and in some cases actually interfere with the healthy process. The main disadvantages are: the disturbance of newly formed epithelium, when many dressings are removed, their fibres become embedded in the new tissues and cause inflammation and delayed healing. Few dressings are true bacterial barriers and the hazard of infection of the wound is always present. Recent studies of the mechanism of wound healing have indicated that a moist, not dry surrounding provides the optimum conditions for wound repair. Healing under Op-site is said to be quicker because the serous exudate permits unhindered migration of new cells across the wound bed and prevents cellular dehydration. In contrast, under dry conditions healing is delayed because the new skin cells must first cleave a path through dehydrated dermis before migrating across the wound. The Op-site wound dressing can be readily applied over the joints and allows complete freedom of movement. The skin remains dry and the wound moist, providing the ideal environment for rapid healing. The film does not adhere to the moist wound and can therefore be removed without damage to the newly formed epidermis. The adhesive is low allergic. Finally, the wound can be assessed without removing the transparent Op-site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Amputation', 'Burns', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fractures, Bone', 'Humans', 'Occlusive Dressings', 'Polyurethanes', 'Postoperative Care', 'Surgical Wound Infection', 'Wound Healing']",3540915,"[['E04.555.080'], ['C26.200'], ['E05.318.372.250.250', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250'], ['C26.404'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E07.101.650'], ['D02.241.081.251.944.750', 'D05.750.716.650', 'D25.720.327.782', 'D25.720.716.650', 'J01.637.051.720.327.782', 'J01.637.051.720.716.650', 'J01.637.412.700'], ['E02.760.731.700', 'E04.604.500', 'N02.421.585.722.700'], ['C01.947.692', 'C23.550.767.925'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

37879,Electrical stimulation of the isolated rat intestine in the presence of nutrient stimulus enhances glucagon-like peptide-1 release.,"The release of small intestinal hormones by constituents of ingested food, such as fatty acids, is integral to post-prandial responses that reduce food intake. Recent evidence suggests that small intestinal electrical stimulation reduces food intake, although the mechanism of action is debated. To test the hypothesis that intestinal stimulation directly alters hormone release locally we used isolated rat distal ileum and measured glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released in the presence or absence of linoleic acid (LA) and electrical field stimulation (EFS). Intact segments were oriented longitudinally between bipolar stimulating electrodes in organ bath chambers containing modified Krebs-Ringers bicarbonate (KRB) buffer including protease inhibitors. Incubation in LA (3 mg ml(-1)) for 45 min increased GLP-1 concentration (21.9 +/- 2.6 pM versus KRB buffer alone 3.6 +/- 0.1 pM). Eleven electrical stimulation conditions were tested. In the presence of LA none of the stimulation conditions inhibited LA-evoked GLP-1 release, whereas two high frequency short pulse widths (14 V, 20 Hz, 5 ms and 14 V, 40 Hz, 5 ms) and one low frequency long pulse width (14 V, 0.4 Hz, 300 ms) EFS conditions enhanced LA-evoked GLP-1 release by >250%. These results are consistent with a local effect of intestinal electrical stimulation to enhance GLP-1 release in response to luminal nutrients in the intestines. Enhancing hormone release could improve the efficacy of intestinal electrical stimulation and provide a potential treatment for obesity and metabolic conditions.","['Animals', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Food', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Glucagon-Like Peptide 1', 'Ileum', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Neural Pathways', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",20664162,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.723.402'], ['G07.203.300', 'J02.500'], ['G10.261.360'], ['D06.472.317.680.500.500'], ['A03.556.124.684.249', 'A03.556.249.124'], ['E05.481'], ['A08.612'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

7366,What is the value of ITS sequence data in Colletotrichum systematics and species diagnosis? A case study using the falcate-spored graminicolous Colletotrichum group.,"Because the genus Colletotrichum is among the most important groups of plant pathogenic fungi worldwide, the ability to accurately diagnose species is vital for the implementation of effective disease control and quarantine measures. Although the long-standing, unresolved taxonomic issues in the genus have recently begun to be addressed through multi-locus phylogenetic research, the tools most commonly used for Colletotrichum species identification are either insufficiently variable (e.g. morphology), or homoplasic (e.g. morphology and host range criteria). In this study, using the systematically well-defined falcate-spored, grass-associated group (FG) of Colletotrichum as a model, we test the utility of ITS sequence data to diagnose species affiliations through similarity-based searches of the NCBI GenBank database or by means of gene trees constructed using phylogenetic methods. 43% of all Colletotrichum sequences accessioned by GenBank are from the ITS region, making it the single most common sequence curated by the community; however, 34% of the ITS accessions existed only as sequence data in the database, with no associated publication. Using Colletotrichum ITS sequence data from 53 FG defined isolates and 16 falcate-spored, non-graminicolous isolates to perform GenBank BLASTN searches, we found that erroneous identifications occurred for 86% of the 14 species tested. In contrast, the phylogenetic tree generated by the ITS sequence data, although poorly supported by bootstrap values, correctly grouped most of the species, but 10% of the individual isolates were incorrectly placed. From this study, we conclude that the currently available infrastructure of Colletotrichum ITS sequence data may yield unreliable species diagnoses, particularly if sequence similarity alone is the only criterion applied.","['Colletotrichum', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA, Fungal', 'DNA, Ribosomal Spacer', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Mycological Typing Techniques', 'Poaceae', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Species Specificity']",19750944,"[['B01.300.381.235'], ['H01.158.273.180', 'L01.313.124'], ['D13.444.308.300'], ['D13.444.308.324.230', 'D13.444.308.475.230'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400.325', 'L01.470.750.750.325'], ['E01.370.225.875.610', 'E05.200.875.610'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['G16.824']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

6901,"The value of computed tomographic scanning in the diagnosis and management of orbital fractures associated with head trauma: a prospective, consecutive study at a level I trauma center.","BACKGROUND: Orbital fractures associated with head trauma are not always easy to diagnose. The real incidence of such fractures is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of routine primary computed tomographic (CT) scanning for diagnosis of orbital fractures in head trauma patients.METHODS: Over a 3-year period, 600 consecutive patients admitted with head trauma were examined clinically; these patients then underwent cranial helical CT scanning, irrespective of severity of head injuries and presence or absence of fracture-related symptoms.RESULTS: Orbital fractures were diagnosed on CT scan in 118 cases (19.7%). All patients with symptoms directly related to an orbital fracture had radiologically diagnosed fractures, compared with 58.3% of patients with isolated blepharohematoma and 3.8% of asymptomatic patients.CONCLUSION: CT scan of the orbits is indicated for any head trauma patient who presents either one or more symptoms directly related to an orbital fracture or just isolated blepharohematoma. CT scan of the orbits is not indicated in asymptomatic head trauma patients. Inclusion of the orbits in the scanning is recommendable only if a CT scan is already being obtained for a head injury. Clinical follow-up is important to detect any late-appearing symptoms. Accurate clinical examination still plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of orbital fractures.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Humans', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orbit', 'Prospective Studies', 'Skull Fractures', 'Switzerland', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",15706197,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.875.250', 'E05.944.500', 'N04.452.859.564.800.250', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.800.325'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.875.500', 'E05.944.600', 'N04.452.859.564.800.500', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.800.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.690'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['C10.900.300.918', 'C26.404.750', 'C26.915.300.745'], ['Z01.542.883'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

525,Enzymatic recovery and purification of polyhydroxybutyrate produced by Ralstonia eutropha.,"Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most studied among a wide variety of polyhydroxyalkanoates, bacterial biodegradable polymers known as potential substitutes for conventional plastics. This work aimed at evaluating the use of enzymes to recover and purify the PHB produced by Ralstonia eutropha DSM545. Screening experiments allowed the selection of trypsin, bromelain and lysozyme among six enzymes, based on their efficiency in lysing cells of a non-PHB producing R. eutropha strain. Then, process conditions for high efficiency in PHB purification from the DSM545 cells were searched for the enzymes previously selected. The best result was achieved with 2.0% of bromelain (enzyme mass per biomass), equivalent to 14.1 U ml(-1), at 50 degrees C and pH 9.0, resulting in 88.8% PHB purity. Aiming at improving the process efficiency and reducing the enzyme cost, experiments were carried out with pancreatin, leading to 90.0% polymer purity and an enzyme cost three times lower than the one obtained with bromelain. The molecular mass analysis of PHB showed no polymer degradation. Therefore, this work demonstrates the potential of using enzymes in order to recover and purify PHB and bacterial biopolymers in general.","['Cellulase', 'Culture Media', 'Cupriavidus necator', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Hydroxybutyrates', 'Muramidase', 'Polyesters', 'Time Factors']",16253372,"[['D08.811.277.450.420.200.200'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['B03.440.400.425.251.200.200', 'B03.660.075.090.688.200.200'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200'], ['D08.811'], ['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['D02.241.081.114.937', 'D02.241.511.429', 'D10.251.400.143.781'], ['D08.811.277.450.642'], ['D05.750.728', 'D25.720.728', 'J01.637.051.720.728'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
27775,Myogenic gene expression at rest and after a bout of resistance exercise in young (18-30 yr) and old (80-89 yr) women.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate mRNA expression of several key skeletal muscle myogenic controllers; myogenic differentiation factor (MyoD), muscle regulatory factor 4 (MRF4), myogenic factor 5 (Myf5), myogenin, myostatin, and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) at rest and 4 h after a single bout of resistance exercise (RE) in young and old women. Eight young women (YW; 23 +/- 2 yr, 67 +/- 5 kg) and six old women (OW; 85 +/- 1 yr, 67 +/- 4 kg) performed 3 sets of 10 repetitions of bilateral knee extensions at 70% of one repetition maximum. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis before and 4 h after RE. Using real-time RT PCR, mRNA from the muscle samples was amplified and normalized to GAPDH. At rest, OW expressed higher (P < 0.05) levels of MyoD, MRF4, Myf5, myogenin, and myostatin compared with YW. In response to RE, there was a main time effect (P < 0.05) for the YW and OW combined in the upregulation of MyoD (2.0-fold) and MRF4 (1.4-fold) and in the downregulation of myostatin (2.2-fold). There was a trend (P = 0.08) for time x age interaction in MRF4. These data show that old women express higher myogenic mRNA levels at rest. The higher resting myogenic mRNA levels in old women may reflect an attempt to preserve muscle mass and function. When challenged with RE, old women appear to respond in a similar manner as young women.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'MyoD Protein', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factor 5', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors', 'Myogenin', 'Myostatin', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Weight Lifting']",16601301,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G07.345.124'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.119', 'E01.370.225.998.054.119', 'E01.370.388.100.100', 'E04.074.119', 'E04.665.100', 'E05.200.500.384.100.119', 'E05.200.998.054.119', 'E05.242.384.100.119'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.210.500.570.294', 'D12.776.260.103.750.294', 'D12.776.260.400.249.624', 'D12.776.930.125.750.294', 'D12.776.930.397.700'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['D12.776.210.500.570.590', 'D12.776.260.103.750.590', 'D12.776.930.125.750.590'], ['D12.776.210.500.570.595', 'D12.776.260.103.750.595', 'D12.776.930.125.750.595'], ['D12.776.210.500.570', 'D12.776.260.103.750', 'D12.776.930.125.750'], ['D12.776.210.500.570.600', 'D12.776.260.103.750.600', 'D12.776.930.125.750.600'], ['D12.644.276.954.300.925', 'D12.776.467.942.300.925', 'D23.529.942.300.925'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D12.644.276.374.687', 'D12.644.276.954.775', 'D12.776.467.374.687', 'D12.776.467.942.775', 'D23.529.374.687', 'D23.529.942.775'], ['I03.450.642.845.950']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

32726,Effectiveness of the typhoid Vi vaccine in overseas travelers from England.,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 500 cases of enteric fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Paratyphi, are reported in the UK each year. The majority are associated with travel to the Indian subcontinent. The typhoid Vi vaccine protects against S. Typhi and is available to travelers from their general practice or private clinics. The effectiveness of this vaccine has been assessed previously in endemic regions of the world but not in travelers.METHODS: Data from the enhanced surveillance scheme concerning persons in England aged ?2 years who traveled from the UK and contracted culture-confirmed enteric fever were used to calculate the effectiveness of the vaccine in travelers. A ""case-case"" case-control design was used, in which patients with typhoid comprised the ""cases"" and those with paratyphoid acted as ""controls.""RESULTS: The overall effectiveness of the vaccine, adjusted for age group, sex, ethnicity, birth in a typhoid-endemic country, and year (of receipt of specimen), was 65% (95% confidence interval 53%-73%). Effectiveness did not vary across subgroups of any of the factors in the model, but there was some evidence of waning effectiveness of the vaccine with increasing time since receipt (trend p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The vaccine has been demonstrated to have a similar effectiveness in travelers as that found in endemic populations. It appears to be protective in all ages, including in young children (aged 2-5 years), a finding not consistently replicated in other studies. However, good hygiene practices are necessary in addition to vaccination to prevent infection. The ""case-case"" case-control design provides a valuable method of calculating the effectiveness of this vaccine in travelers, given the availability of paratyphoid controls, a population with similar demographics and risk exposures.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Travel', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Typhoid-Paratyphoid Vaccines', 'United Kingdom', 'Young Adult']",25444695,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I03.883'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['C01.150.252.400.310.821.873'], ['D20.215.894.135.685.910'], ['Z01.542.363'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

Although many biotelemetry devices record 3D location data with x, y, and z coordinates from tracked animals, the third z coordinate is typically not integrated into studies of animal spatial use. Disregarding the vertical component may seriously limit understanding of animal habitat use and niche separation. We present novel movement-based kernel density estimators and computer visualization tools for generating and exploring 3D home ranges based on location data.

27413,Calcium dynamics in root cells of Arabidopsis thaliana visualized with selective plane illumination microscopy.,"Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) is an imaging technique particularly suited for long term in-vivo analysis of transparent specimens, able to visualize small organs or entire organisms, at cellular and eventually even subcellular resolution. Here we report the application of SPIM in Calcium imaging based on F?rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the genetically encoded-FRET-based Ca(2+) probe Cameleon, in the cytosol or nucleus, were used to demonstrate that SPIM enables ratiometric fluorescence imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution, both at tissue and single cell level. The SPIM-FRET technique enabled us to follow nuclear and cytosolic Ca(2+) dynamics in Arabidopsis root tip cells, deep inside the organ, in response to different stimuli. A relevant physiological phenomenon, namely Ca(2+) signal percolation, predicted in previous studies, has been directly visualized.","['Arabidopsis', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cytosol', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Ion Transport', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Plant Cells', 'Plant Roots', 'Plants, Genetically Modified']",24146766,"[['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.157.100'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['G02.111.820.800.100', 'G03.143.500.100', 'G04.835.800.100'], ['D12.776.157.125'], ['A11.284.430.106', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.117'], ['A11.284.430.214.200', 'A11.284.430.429.200', 'A11.284.835.450.200'], ['E05.196.712.516.600.676.500', 'G01.154.240.280', 'G02.111.255.280'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.435'], ['L01.224.308'], ['G03.143.500'], ['D12.776.532'], ['E01.370.350.515.395', 'E05.595.395'], ['A11.750'], ['A18.400'], ['B01.650.520', 'B05.620.600']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
47043,Paradoxical Increase in Mortality and Rupture of Intracranial Aneurysms in Microsomal Prostaglandin E2 Synthase Type 1-Deficient Mice: Attenuation by Aspirin.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays an important role in formation and rupture of intracranial aneurysms. Expression of microsomal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthase type 1 (mPGES-1) is increased in the wall of intracranial aneurysms in humans. PGE2, a by-product of mPGES-1, is associated with inflammation and cerebrovascular dysfunction.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that deletion of mPGES-1 decreases the formation and rupture of intracranial aneurysms in a murine model.METHODS: Intracranial aneurysms were induced in wild-type and mPGES-1 knockout (mPGES-1 KO) mice by using a combination of deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-induced hypertension and intracranial injection of elastase in the basal cistern. Prevalence of aneurysms, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and mortality were assessed. We also tested the effects of administration of aspirin (6 mg/kg/d) by gavage and PGE2 (1 mg/kg/d) by subcutaneous infusion.RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure and prevalence of aneurysm were similar in wild-type and mPGES-1 KO mice. However, mortality and the prevalence of subarachnoid hemorrhage were markedly increased in mPGES-1 KO mice (P < .05). Bone marrow reconstitution studies suggest that mPGES-1 derived from leukocytes does not appear to increase rupture of intracranial aneurysms. Aspirin, but not PGE2, attenuated the increased mortality in mPGES-1 KO mice (P < .05).CONCLUSION: Vascular mPGES-1 plays a protective role in blood vessels and attenuates rupture of cerebral aneurysms. In contrast to effects on abdominal aneurysms, mPGES-1 deficiency is associated with an increase in rupture of cerebral aneurysms and mortality, which are attenuated by low-dose aspirin.","['Aneurysm, Ruptured', 'Animals', 'Aspirin', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microsomes', 'Mortality', 'Prostaglandin-E Synthases']",26134597,"[['C14.907.055.185'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595.176'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.228.140.300.510.600', 'C14.907.055.635', 'C14.907.253.560.300'], ['D08.811.399.475'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['A11.284.835.540'], ['E05.318.308.985.550', 'N01.224.935.698', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550'], ['D08.811.399.475.600']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This contains 5,6-Methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane and 2-Aminoindane, both amphetamine analogues with the potential to cause methaemoglobinaemia. Furthermore, the most common 'cutting agent' for legal highs in the UK is benzocaine, also known to cause methaemoglobinaemia. Given the increasing prevalence of legal highs, particularly those containing added benzocaine, such presentations may become more common. Furthermore, in one case series, benzocaine gel used for toothache was the second most common reason for hospitalisation due to acquired methaemoglobinaemia after dapsone use. Indeed, the Federal Drug Agency has issued as public warning as to the risk of these products. We therefore think that clinicians and the public should be made more aware of the risk associated with such agents.","['Benzocaine', 'Cyanosis', 'Humans', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Indans', 'Methemoglobinemia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology', 'Substance-Related Disorders']",25063354,"[['D02.241.223.100.050.500.643', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.020.937.687'], ['C23.888.248'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D26.878'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.486.487', 'D04.615.486.487'], ['C15.378.619'], ['F04.824'], ['C25.775', 'F03.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here, we describe the effects of two environmental factors (crowding and temperature) on phenotypic expression of feminization, the host's fecundity and Wolbachia infection intensity among life cycle stages in the naturally Wolbachia-infected copepod, Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides. The copepod was first found to be co-infected with Wolbachia A- and B-supergroups Wolbachia strains based on wsp primers. The relative Wolbachia infection intensity within individuals was determined using quantitative real-time PCR and was significantly higher in the B-supergroup than in the A-supergroup. Experimental results of temperature effect on bacterial density in each developmental stage revealed a significant decrease in Wolbachia infection intensity following exposure to high temperature (37°C) in both sexes and implied that Wolbachia might survive in room temperature (25°C) better than in high temperature. Experimental results of crowding effects on Wolbachia infection intensity suggested a negative correlation between copepod nauplii and Wolbachia infection intensity. No effect of rearing temperature on the sex ratio was reported although the fecundity was significantly decreased by high temperature. The results showed that Wolbachia infection intensity to be correlated with crowding conditions and was decreased following exposure of elevated temperature.","['Animals', 'Copepoda', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Hot Temperature', 'Male', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sex Ratio', 'Wolbachia']",27756651,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.131.365.160'], ['G08.686.210'], ['C01.150.252.400'], ['G01.906.595.543', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.380', 'G16.500.750.775.710.380', 'N06.230.300.100.725.232', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.380'], ['E05.393.620.500.706'], ['G05.815', 'I01.240.800.815', 'N01.224.803.815', 'N06.850.505.400.850.815'], ['B03.660.050.783.500.762']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
32651,The use of quantitative computed tomography to estimate risk of fracture of the hip from falls.,"We conducted an in vitro investigation of the loads and energies needed to fracture the proximal part of the femur in twelve fresh cadavera under loading conditions simulating one particular type of fall. The fracture loads ranged from 778 to 4,040 newtons and the work to fracture, from five to fifty-one joules. We also investigated the relationship between the fracture loads and several potential indices of bone strength, which were measured non-invasively at the subcapital, basic-cervical, and intertrochanteric regions with quantitative computed tomography. A very high positive correlation with the fracture load resulted from use of an intertrochanteric index--the product of the average trabecular computed-tomography number and the total cross-sectional area of the bone (R2 = 0.93, standard error of estimate = 295 newtons, and p less than 0.00001). We expect the use of this parameter to result in improved assessments of the degree of osteoporosis and of the component of risk of fracture of the hip that is associated with bone strength. However, the measured work to fracture for the isolated femur was an order of magnitude smaller than estimates of the energy available during a typical fall (about 450 joules), suggesting that energy absorbed during falling and impact, rather than bone strength, may be the dominant factors in the biomechanics of fracture of the hip.","['Accidental Falls', 'Accidents', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Female', 'Hip Fractures', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2355030,"[['N06.850.135.122'], ['N06.850.135'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['C26.404.061.425', 'C26.531.750', 'C26.558.276.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.800', 'G17.680.750', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
3084,LFCseq: a nonparametric approach for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.,"BACKGROUND: With the advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, RNA-seq has rapidly emerged as a powerful tool for the quantitative analysis of gene expression and transcript variant discovery. In comparative experiments, differential expression analysis is commonly performed on RNA-seq data to identify genes/features that are differentially expressed between biological conditions. Most existing statistical methods for differential expression analysis are parametric and assume either Poisson distribution or negative binomial distribution on gene read counts. However, violation of distributional assumptions or a poor estimation of parameters often leads to unreliable results.RESULTS: In this paper, we introduce a new nonparametric approach called LFCseq that uses log fold changes as a differential expression test statistic. To test each gene for differential expression, LFCseq estimates a null probability distribution of count changes from a selected set of genes with similar expression strength. In contrast, the nonparametric NOISeq approach relies on a null distribution estimated from all genes within an experimental condition regardless of their expression levels.CONCLUSION: Through extensive simulation study and RNA-seq real data analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed approach could well rank the differentially expressed genes ahead of non-differentially expressed genes, thereby achieving a much improved overall performance for differential expression analysis.","['Algorithms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Poisson Distribution', 'RNA', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Software']",25560842,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['L01.224.160'], ['E05.393.332'], ['G05.308.370'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.994.750', 'G17.820.750', 'N05.715.360.750.750.620', 'N06.850.520.830.994.750'], ['D13.444.735'], ['E05.393.760.710'], ['L01.224.900']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

32408,Validity of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) in post-stroke subjects.,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment and dementia are very common after stroke. Telephone screening has potential advantages for clinical follow-up and population-based research in this group. We wished to test the validity of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) for cognitive testing in post-stroke subjects.METHODS: Cognitive function in stroke outpatients was assessed using the R-CAMCOG (a modification of the cognitive part of the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly, for use in stroke subjects) along with the TICS and a modified version, the TICSm. The tests were administered in random order. A cut-off point of 33 on the R-CAMCOG was used to define post-stroke dementia.RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with a median age of 72 years were assessed. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the R-CAMCOG and the TICS and TICSm were 0.833 and 0.855 (both p <0.001) respectively. Twenty-four (38%) patients met R-CAMCOG criteria for post-stroke dementia. The area under the ROC curve for both the TICS and TICSm was 0.94. Using a cut-off of 28 or less on the TICS produced a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 85% for the diagnosis of post-stroke dementia. For the TICSm a cut-off of 20 or lower produced a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 80%.CONCLUSIONS: The TICS and TICSm telephone questionnaires are practicable and valid methods of assessing cognitive function in community outpatients following stroke. Scores of < or =28 and < or =20 respectively carry good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of post-stroke dementia.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Psychometrics', 'Remote Consultation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Telephone']",14716702,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C10.228.140.300', 'C14.907.253'], ['F03.615.250'], ['C10.228.140.380', 'F03.615.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.669.599'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['F04.711.780'], ['L01.178.847.652.550', 'N04.452.758.849.550', 'N04.590.374.800.550'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['L01.178.847.698']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

28538,Statin therapy influences endothelial cell morphology and F-actin cytoskeleton structure when exposed to static and laminar shear stress conditions.,"AIMS: To determine how statin drugs (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) affect endothelial cell (EC) shape and F-actin cytoskeleton arrangement in the presence of physiologically relevant wall shear stress (WSS) of 12.5dyn/cm(2).MAIN METHODS: Human abdominal aortic endothelial cells (HAAECs) were cultured to a confluent monolayer within three dimensional tissue culture models and presheared for 6h at 12.5 dyn/cm(2) within a continuous flow loop. Statins were added to the perfusion media and the perfusion was continued for a further 24h. ECs were then analyzed for morphology and F-actin cytoskeleton arrangement using light microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy.KEY FINDINGS: ECs became rounded with a significantly higher shape index with the addition of 10ìM simvastatin under both static and flow conditions. F-actin cytoskeleton structure was disorganized and fragmented with statin treatment under static and flow conditions. Neither of these findings were observed with the addition of both simvastatin and 200ìM mevalonate, confirming regulation through the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.SIGNIFICANCE: EC morphology and F-actin cytoskeleton arrangement are regulated through the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and are therefore impacted by statin treatment. ECs treated with statins became rounded, which is usually associated with unhealthy cells in regions of the vasculature prone to developing atherosclerotic plaques.","['Actin Cytoskeleton', 'Aorta, Abdominal', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Male', 'Mevalonic Acid', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Simvastatin', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Young Adult']",23517776,"[['A11.284.430.214.190.750.050'], ['A07.015.114.056.205'], ['A11.251'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197', 'D10.570.938.208'], ['A11.436.275'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.519.186.071.202.370', 'D27.505.519.389.370', 'D27.505.954.557.500.202.370'], ['D02.241.511.579'], ['E01.370.350.515.395', 'E05.595.395'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.638.400.900', 'D04.615.638.400.900'], ['G01.374.835'], ['E05.481.500.617'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
36948,A rare case of paratesticular pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration: a case report.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of children and young adults. It represents 6.5% of all malignant tumors in pediatrics with an annual incidence of 4 to 7 cases per million children. Embryonal RMS arising in paratesticular region in young males is a common entity, however pleomorphic RMS in such location is quite rare. An eighteen year old male presented with painless right scrotal mass measuring 7 x 6 x 5 cm of two year duration, which was reported on ultrasonography as extratesticular tumor. Fine needle aspiration showed cellular smears comprising of pleomorphic population of mostly singly scattered cells and few cell aggregates. Few isolated large cells with whip like cytoplasmic processes and faint cross-striations were also seen. A diagnosis of paratesticular malignant mesenchymal tumor probably RMS was made. Tumor was removed surgically with right sided orchidectomy. On histopathology, it was reported as pleomorphic RMS. There was focal lymphatic invasion and involvement of rete testis. Immunostaining of tumor cells revealed myogenin and desmin positivity. The case is being presented because of diagnosis of RMS on Fine needle aspiration and rare occurrence of pleomorphic RMS in paratesticular location.","['Adolescent', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Scrotum', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms']",19790247,"[['M01.060.057'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.119.500', 'E01.370.225.998.054.119.500', 'E01.370.388.100.100.500', 'E04.074.119.500', 'E04.665.100.500', 'E05.200.500.384.100.119.500', 'E05.200.998.054.119.500', 'E05.242.384.100.119.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['C04.557.450.590.550.660', 'C04.557.450.795.550.660'], ['A05.360.444.661'], ['C04.588.839']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
20806,Migration behavior of metal complexes in capillary zone electrophoresis. Interpretation in terms of quantitative structure-mobility relationships.,"Significant advances in metal ion analysis by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) have occurred as a consequence of using metal complexes with various organic and inorganic ligands. Metal-ligand complexes that contribute to metal speciation in solution have also gained the attention of researchers. An understanding of the molecular properties that control the separation and further insight into the migration mechanism call for a systematic analysis of relationships between migration parameters and charge and size characteristics of metal complexes. To perform such an investigation, a number multiparametric migration models derived from a generally valid equation for electrophoretic mobility as a function of charge density were developed. The models operating with tabular or readily calculated structural descriptors (in particular, metal atom electronegativity or effective charge) as well as with the formal charge and ligand number were evaluated using numerous sets of experimental migration data for inorganic and organic ligand complexes. Consistent--in a great many instances--approximation results confirm the separation mechanism for metal complexes in CZE as governed basically by differences in charge-to-size parameters, present a valuable and convincing selection of such parameters, possessing a definite physical meaning, and owing to the general validity of the multivariate regression approach, open new possibilities in its application to more complex (i.e., electrokinetic chromatographic) systems.","['Chelating Agents', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Metals', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship']",11833646,"[['D27.505.519.914.500', 'D27.720.832.500'], ['E05.196.401.190', 'E05.301.300.190'], ['D01.552'], ['G02.111.830.500', 'G07.690.773.997.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
29197,"Spatiotemporal detection and analysis of exocytosis reveal fusion ""hotspots"" organized by the cytoskeleton in endocrine cells.","Total internal reflection fluorescence microscope has often been used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying vesicle exocytosis. However, the spatial occurrence of the fusion events within a single cell is not frequently explored due to the lack of sensitive and accurate computer-assisted programs to analyze large image data sets. Here, we have developed an image analysis platform for the nonbiased identification of different types of vesicle fusion events with high accuracy in different cell types. By performing spatiotemporal analysis of stimulus-evoked exocytosis in insulin-secreting INS-1 cells, we statistically prove that individual vesicle fusion events are clustered at hotspots. This spatial pattern disappears upon the disruption of either the actin or the microtubule network; this disruption also severely inhibits evoked exocytosis. By demonstrating that newcomer vesicles are delivered from the cell interior to the surface membrane for exocytosis, we highlight a previously unappreciated mechanism in which the cytoskeleton-dependent transportation of secretory vesicles organizes exocytosis hotspots in endocrine cells.","['Actin Cytoskeleton', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Exocytosis', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Rats', 'Secretory Vesicles']",25606674,"[['A11.284.430.214.190.750.050'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G04.468'], ['A03.734.414.131', 'A06.300.414.087', 'A06.390.131', 'A11.382.625.092', 'A11.436.294.092'], ['G04.575'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.880.810']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

31821,Does the Iliac Wing Influence L5 Pedicle Screw Fixation?,"OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the iliac wing influences L5 pedicle screw (PS) fixation and to propose methods to reduce such influence.METHODS: A total of 100 computed tomography scans (from 50 male and 50 female patients) of the lower lumbar region and pelvis were obtained and 3-dimensionally reconstructed. Cylinders with 6.5-mm diameters were drawn to simulate the different trajectories of L5 PS. The maximum lengths and lateral angles of trajectories, and the vertical distances from the inner edge of the iliac wing to these trajectories, were measured.RESULTS: The maximum lengths and lateral angles differed significantly among trajectories; the maximum length, but not the lateral angle, differed significantly between male and female subjects. The influence of the iliac wing was more significant in male than in female subjects. The iliac wing had a greater effect on screws implanted along the pedicle axis than on screws for which the trajectories commenced at Du's entry point and passed through the center of the pedicle.CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates the influence of the iliac wing on L5 PS fixation. Careful attention is required when implanting PSs, especially in male patients. The combined use of Du's technique and a percutaneous method for PS implantation effectively reduces the influence of the iliac wing. To minimize the complications of PS fixation further, preoperative simulation of fixation for each patient is very important.","['Anthropometry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ilium', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', 'Pedicle Screws', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",29452313,"[['E01.370.600.024', 'E05.041', 'N06.850.505.200.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.232.043.825.434'], ['E01.370.350.400', 'L01.224.308.410'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['E07.695.370.437.500', 'E07.858.442.660.460.437.500', 'E07.858.690.725.460.437.500'], ['G08.686.815'], ['E04.555.100.700'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
33804,Interprofessional Education in U.S. Dental Hygiene Programs: Program Director Responses Before and After Introduction of CODA Standard 2-15.,"A 2014 survey found that dental hygiene program directors perceived interprofessional education (IPE) as a priority for themselves and the dental hygiene profession in the U.S. The aim of this study was to explore whether IPE collaborations in dental hygiene programs and program directors' attitudes changed from 2014 to 2017 since the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) Standard 2-15 on IPE was introduced in August 2016. In May 2017, directors of all 325 U.S. dental hygiene programs were invited to participate in a web-based survey. A total of 117 directors responded, for a 38% response rate, and their responses were then compared with the responses in 2014 (that survey had a 33% response rate). The results showed that, while the percentage of responding dental hygiene programs with a nursing program on campus had decreased (90% to 80%; p<0.022), the likelihood of having other health care-related programs on campus did not change. In 2017 as compared to 2014, the programs were still most likely to collaborate with nursing (50% vs. 46%) and other allied health professions (44% vs. 56%) and in intraprofessional education with dental assisting programs (41% vs. 41%). IPE was still most likely to occur in volunteer activities (68% vs. 73%), basic science courses (65% vs. 60%), and communications training (63% vs. 63%). In 2017, program directors rated IPE as less challenging for programs to manage than in 2014 (on five-point scale with 1=not at all challenging: 3.31 vs. 3.62; p=0.022). However, the responding directors did not view IPE as being as important to the profession in 2017 as the respondents reported in 2014 (3.29 vs. 3.88; p<0.001). The majority in 2017 agreed/strongly agreed that Standard 2-15 will improve the profile of dental hygiene as part of the health care team (77%) and contribute to integrating dental hygiene into interprofessional care (IPC) teams (78%). Overall, this study found that the introduction of an explicit IPE dental hygiene CODA standard in 2016 had already resulted in changes after only one year. However, the responding program directors' lower agreement with statements concerning their graduates' IPC-related competence deserves further attention.","['Curriculum', 'Dental Hygienists', 'Humans', 'Interprofessional Relations', 'Schools, Dental', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",30600245,"[['I02.158'], ['M01.526.485.067.105.376', 'N02.360.067.105.376'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.401.205'], ['I02.783.495.481'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

38659,Land use regression model for ultrafine particles in Amsterdam.,"There are currently no epidemiological studies on health effects of long-term exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP), largely because data on spatial exposure contrasts for UFP is lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a land use regression (LUR) model for UFP in the city of Amsterdam. Total particle number concentrations (PNC), PM10, PM2.5, and its soot content were measured directly outside 50 homes spread over the city of Amsterdam. Each home was measured during one week. Continuous measurements at a central urban background site were used to adjust the average concentration for temporal variation. Predictor variables (traffic, address density, land use) were obtained using geographic information systems. A model including the product of traffic intensity and the inverse distance to the nearest road squared, address density, and location near the port explained 67% of the variability in measured PNC. LUR models for PM2.5, soot, and coarse particles (PM10, PM2.5) explained 57%, 76%, and 37% of the variability in measured concentrations. Predictions from the PNC model correlated highly with predictions from LUR models for PM2.5, soot, and coarse particles. A LUR model for PNC has been developed, with similar validity as previous models for more commonly measured pollutants.","['Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Cities', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Linear Models', 'Netherlands', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter']",21158386,"[['D27.888.284.101'], ['N06.850.460.100'], ['G16.500.275.069', 'N06.230.069', 'Z01.433'], ['N06.850.460.350'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.314', 'L01.470.750.750.462'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['G02.712'], ['D20.633']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
38405,Tetrodotoxin-resistant Na+ spikes of C fibers have at least two subtypes in the isolated bullfrog sciatic nerve.,"The C fiber compound action potentials (C-CAPs) were studied for their properties with the vaseline gap method from the isolated bullfrog sciatic nerve. Two components (the fast and the slow C-CAPs) were found to be Na+ dependent and tetrodotoxin-resistant. The conduction velocities of the fast and the slow C-CAPs were 0.61 +/- 0.06 m/s (n = 13) and 0.42 +/- 0.05 m/s (n = 8), respectively; their time constants were 11.4 +/- 1.7 m/s and 16.3 +/- 1/7 ms, respectively, with both parameters being significantly different at P < 0.01. The slow C-CAP had about 1.3 times higher threshold than that of the fast C-CAP, with a significant difference (P < 0.01). They showed differential sensitivity to lidocaine and Cd2+. Capsaicin reduced the amplitudes of both fast and slow C-CAPs, but not abolished.

23296,A urine preservative system to maintain bacterial counts. A laboratory and clinical evaluation.,"The urinary tract is a common site of infection in the hospitalized, institutionalized, or ambulatory patient population. Ideally, urine should be cultured immediately or refrigerated up to 24 hours for quantitative examination for microorganisms. In the evaluation of patients at their homes or in long-term care facilities, rapid plating or refrigeration may not be practical. This is also true when evaluating small children in whom external collection devices are required to obtain a specimen. Because of these limitations, we evaluated a urine preservative and transport system, the Sage Products Urine Culture Tube, in a study of 1469 clinical specimens. This tube utilizes boric acid (1.1% final concentration) as a preservative. The Urine Culture Tube was easy to use and was as effective as refrigeration in maintaining bacterial counts. This system may be particularly useful where rapid transport or refrigeration is limited.","['Bacteria', 'Boric Acids', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Preservation, Biological', 'Refrigeration', 'Specimen Handling', 'Urine']",3924460,"[['B03'], ['D01.029.260.093', 'D01.132.250', 'D02.203.130'], ['N03.219.151.125'], ['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['E01.354.340'], ['E01.354.506'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['E02.792', 'E05.760'], ['E02.792.643', 'E05.760.643'], ['E01.370.225.998', 'E05.200.998'], ['A12.207.927']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
8219,Urinary infection before and after prostatectomy.,"To determine the prevalence of pre and post prostatectomy related urinary tract infection and its correlation with peri-operative events, we studied 120 patients who underwent prostatectomy due to benign prostatic hypertrophy from September 2005 to September 2006. Urine cultures were performed before the operations, after a week, and three months later. Data including prostate volume, prostatic specific antigen (PSA), post voiding residue (PVR) and histopathological reports as well as the duration of urinary leak, bladder irrigation, hospitalization, and catheterization were studied. The mean age of the studied patients was 70.5 +/- 8 years. Significant preoperative bacteriuria was revealed in 18 (15%) patients of whom 14(77%) patients developed negative cultures following the operation. Postoperative bacteriuria was detected in 9(7.5%) patients who negative urine cultures preoperatively. Pre and post operative micro-organisms were different in the majority of the cases. The mean PSA was higher in patients with a positive history of infection. Following prostatectomy, patients with positive urine cultures had significantly longer urinary leakage, catheterization, and hospital stays compared with those who remained culture negative. We conclude that the incidence of positive urine culture pri-prostatectomy for BPH can be improved by appropriate antibiotic therapy, and the risk factors for postoperative urinary infection include preoperative infection, prolonged urinary leakage, catheterization, and hospital stay. The elevated PSA may be a risk factor.","['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iran', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary Tract Infections', 'Urine']",20228515,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['Z01.252.245.500.350'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.442.750', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.442.750', 'D12.776.866.249.500', 'D23.050.285.625', 'D23.101.140.625'], ['E04.950.774.860.625'], ['C12.294.565.500'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['G02.111.905', 'G05.308.850', 'G07.690.773.998'], ['E01.370.390.820', 'E02.148.947', 'E05.157.500'], ['C01.915', 'C12.777.892', 'C13.351.968.892'], ['A12.207.927']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
20462,Forget Me if You Can: Attentional capture by to-Be-remembered and to-Be-forgotten visual stimuli.,"Previous studies on directed forgetting in visual working memory (VWM) have shown that, if people are cued to remember only a subset of the items currently held in VWM, they will completely forget the uncued, no longer relevant items. While this finding is indicative of selective remembering, it remains unclear whether directed forgetting can also occur in the absence of any concurrent to-be-remembered information. In the current study, we addressed this matter by asking participants to memorize a single object that could be followed by a cue to forget or remember this object. Following the cue, we assessed the object's activation in VWM by determining whether a matching distractor would capture attention in a visual search task. The results showed that, compared to a cue to remember, a cue to forget led to a reduced likelihood of attentional capture by a matching distractor. In addition, we found that capture effects by to-be-remembered and to-be-forgotten distractors remained stable as the interval between the onset of the cue and the search task increased from 700 ms to 3900 ms. We conclude that, in the absence of any to-be-remembered objects, an instruction to forget an object held in WM leads to a rapid but incomplete deactivation of the representation of that object, thus allowing it to continue to produce a weak biasing effect on attentional selection for several seconds after the instruction to forget.","['Adult', 'Attention', 'Cues', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory, Short-Term', 'Mental Recall', 'Young Adult']",28074450,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F02.830.104.214'], ['F02.463.425.234'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425.540.407'], ['F02.463.425.540.641'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
8036,Is bad living better than good death? Impact of demographic and cultural factors on health state preference.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of demographic and cultural factors on health preferences among Chinese general population.METHODS: The Chinese EQ-5D-5L valuation study was conducted between December 2012 and January 2013. A total of 1296 participants were recruited from the general public at Beijing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Nanjing, and Shenyang. Each participant was interviewed to measure preferences for ten EQ-5D-5L health states using composite time trade-off and seven pairs of states using discrete choice experiment (data were not included in this study). At the end of the interview, each participant was also asked to provide their demographic information and answers to two questions about their attitudes towards whether bad living is better than good death (LBD) and whether they believe in an afterlife. Generalized linear model and random effects logistic models were used to examine the impact of demographic and cultural factors on health preferences.RESULTS: Participants who had serious illness experience received college or higher education, or agree with LBD were more likely to value health states positively and have a narrower score range. Participants at Beijing were more likely to be non-traders, value health states positively, less likely to reach the lowest possible score, and have narrower score range compared with all other four cities after controlling for all other demographic and culture factors.CONCLUSIONS: Health state preference is significantly affected by factors beyond demographics. These factors should be considered in achieving a representative sample in valuation studies in China.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Beijing', 'Buddhism', 'China', 'Choice Behavior', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Preference', 'Quality of Life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Religious Philosophies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",26346987,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['Z01.252.474.164.225', 'Z01.433.114'], ['K01.844.117'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['F02.463.785.373.346'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.100.150.750.625.500', 'F01.145.488.887.625.500', 'N04.452.822.700.500', 'N05.300.150.800.625.500'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.740.100.500.700', 'N01.224.935.530.700'], ['K01.844.799'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
10143,Whooping cough vaccination: some reasons for non-completion.,"The decline in the number of children nationally being vaccinated against pertussis has caused anxiety and concern, both for parents and for professional workers. Publicity by the media and professional press has added to the confusion, and has been largely held responsible for the present situation. A survey was undertaken to analyse the factors which may have been responsible for the reduction in the number of children coming forward for pertussis vaccination in Leicestershire. These factors included social class, the position of the child within the family, and the reasons given by families for omission of the vaccine. Observations on the computerized record of immunization and vaccination, and the family's own record of the dates of immunization were made.

42422,A three-phase clinical evaluation of prazosin.,"A preliminary study of cardiac hemodynamics with measurement in both supine and tilt positions showed that the antihypertensive effect of prazosin given intravenously is associated with a fall in total peripheral resistance, with minor effects on cardiac output and heart rate, and with no consistent orthostatic hypotension. The postural reflexes appear to remain intact. The results are entirely similar to those reported by Lund-Johansen. In a second, short-term study of ambulatory patients, prazosin alone exerted an antihypertensive effect somewhat less than that of methyldopa, but the difference in blood pressure reduction between supine and standing positions was less with prazosin than with methyldopa.

22588,A new pollen-derived microcarrier for pantoprazole delivery.,"Plant-derived carriers have emerged as promising materials for drug encapsulation. Especially, sporopollenin microcapsules extracted from diverse pollen species have been proved to be effective drug carriers due to their biocompatibility, homogeneity in size, resistance to harsh chemical conditions and high thermal stability. Here in this study, sporopollenin microcapsules were isolated successfully from the pollens of a common tree (Corylus avellana, the European hazelnut) and used as a carrier for pantoprazole (PaNa) (a proton pump inhibitor). The drug entrapment efficiency was recorded as 29.81%. SEM micrographs clearly showed the drug was loaded into the microcapsules through the apertures of microcapsule and also some drugs were adsorbed on the surface of microcapsules. FT-IR spectra analysis confirmed the drug loading. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that thermal stability of PaNa was enhanced by encapsulation. In vitro release studies showed that PaNa-loaded sporopollenin microcapsules exhibited better release performance than the control. C. avellana sporopollenin microcapsules can make an efficient carrier for delivery of PaNa.","['2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles', 'Corylus', 'Drug Carriers', 'Pantoprazole', 'Pollen']",27987792,"[['D02.886.640.074', 'D03.383.725.024', 'D03.633.100.103.034'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.750.200.875'], ['D26.255.260', 'E02.319.300.380'], ['D02.886.640.074.625', 'D03.383.725.024.625', 'D03.633.100.103.034.625'], ['A18.024.249.500.249.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Different dosage of TMP, RSM and norepinephrine (NE) were used to study their effects on the collagen synthesis and proliferation of cultured cardiac Fbs.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, moderate or high dosage TMP and RSM could significantly inhibit the collagen synthesis and the proliferation of cultured cardiac Fbs. Moreover, low-dose TMP(50 mg/L) and low-dose RSM(3 g/L) could antagonize the collagen synthesis and the proliferation of cultured cardiac FB stimulated by NE (500 micrograms/L).CONCLUSION: Both TMP and RSM could inhibit these processes. The mechanisms of these effect might be correlated to their Ca++ antagonistic action.","['Animals', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Fibroblasts', 'Male', 'Myocardium', 'Plant Extracts', 'Pyrazines', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza']",11477820,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.562.249', 'D27.505.696.260.500', 'D27.505.954.411.192'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251'], ['D05.750.078.280', 'D12.776.860.300.250'], ['D20.215.784.500.350', 'D26.335'], ['A11.329.228'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['D03.383.679'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.583.520.922.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
30257,Distance measurements in nucleic acids using windowless dipolar recoupling solid state NMR.,"A windowless, homonuclear dipolar recoupling pulse sequence (DRAWS) is described and a theoretical basis for describing its recoupling performance is developed using numerical techniques. It is demonstrated that DRAWS recouples weak dipolar interactions over a broad range of experimental and molecular conditions. We discuss two spectroscopic control experiments, which help to take into account effects due to insufficient proton decoupling, relaxation, and static dipolar couplings to nearby 13C spins at natural abundance. Finally DRAWS is used in combination with selective 13C labeling to measure 13C-13C distances in five doubly labeled DNA dodecamers, [d(CGCGAAT*T*CGCG)]2, which contain the binding site for the restriction enzyme EcoRI. The longest distance reported is 4.8 A. In most cases the distances agree well with those derived from X-ray crystallographic data, although small changes in hydration level can result in relatively large changes in internuclear distances.","['Carbon Isotopes', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleic Acids']",9050159,"[['D01.268.150.075', 'D01.496.123'], ['L01.224.160'], ['E05.196.309.742.225'], ['D13.444.308'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['L01.224.680'], ['G02.111.570.820.486', 'G05.360.580'], ['D13.444']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
24099,Reversal of lung lesions in transgenic transforming growth factor alpha mice by expression of mutant epidermal growth factor receptor.,"Transgenic mice expressing transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) in type II cells under control of the lung-specific surfactant protein-C (SP-C) promoter develop pulmonary fibrosis and marked airspace hypoplasia. To identify cellular signaling mechanisms involved in lesion formation, we generated transgenic mice expressing a mutant epidermal growth factor receptor lacking a portion of the intracytoplasmic domain (EGF-R-M) under control of the human SP-C promoter. Transcripts of the SP-C-EGF-R-M transgene were detected in distal bronchiolar and type II cells by in situ hybridization. The morphology of lungs from the SP-C-EGF-R-M transgenic mice was normal. Lung fibrosis was not detectable and airspace hypoplasia was significantly corrected in bitransgenic mice derived by breeding SP-C-TGF-alpha and SP-C-EGF-R-M mice. Correction of lung pathology in the bitransgenic mice occurred without altering the level of hTGF-alpha mRNA. To further demonstrate that reversal of TGF-alpha lesions required signaling through the EGF-R, SP-C-TGF-alpha transgenic mice were bred to mice homozygous for the wa-2 mutation which encodes a mutated EGF-R. TGF-alpha-induced lesions were reversed in homozygous wa-2 mice. Amelioration of TGF-alpha-dependent pulmonary lesions in SP-C-EGF-R-M mice or wa-2/wa-2 mice supports the concept that autocrine and paracrine signaling mediate fibrosis and airspace remodeling caused by TGF-alpha.","['Animals', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Lung', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha']",8879184,"[['B01.050'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074'], ['G05.308'], ['E05.393.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A04.411'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['G05.365.590'], ['C08.381.765'], ['D12.644.276.382.750', 'D12.644.276.963.360', 'D12.776.467.382.750', 'D12.776.467.960.360', 'D23.529.382.750', 'D23.529.960.360']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
24736,Mercury water and cauterizing stones: Nicolas Andr? and tic douloureux.,"In his 1756 text, Observations pratiques sur les maladies de l'ur?thre et sur plusiers faits convulsifs, Nicolas Andr? coined the term ""tic douloureux."" He believed that this pain originated from compression of facial sensory peripheral nerves. Using scientific observation and experimentation to confirm this hypothesis, he reproduced the tic pain and treated it by using careful efforts to remove adhesions from the nerve with a caustic solution of mercury water. Believing that recurrence of the pain was a result of early closure of the wound, with recompression of the nerve being the direct cause, Andr? prevented recompression by ensuring open wound drainage. Andr?'s surgical technique of using cauterizing stones ensured that there was minimal blood loss and little danger of rebleeding and recompression of the nerve by an accumulated blood clot. His case reports include lengthy follow-up periods that documented the benefits of his procedures, which were confirmed by testimonials from uninvolved colleagues. Although remembered for the two words, ""tic douloureux,"" Nicolas Andr? has long been ignored for his prescient treatment and scientific analysis of a disease for which the modern standard of care has only been defined during the last generation.","['Cautery', 'France', 'History, 18th Century', 'Humans', 'Mercury', 'Solutions', 'Trigeminal Neuralgia']",10223470,"[['E02.154', 'E04.014.170'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['K01.400.504.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.268.556.504', 'D01.268.956.437', 'D01.552.544.504'], ['D26.776'], ['C07.465.299.625.500.700', 'C10.292.319.625.700.700']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
41025,Solution structure of subunit F(6) from the peripheral stalk region of ATP synthase from bovine heart mitochondria.,"The ATP synthase enzyme structure includes two stalk assemblies, the central stalk and the peripheral stalk. Catalysis involves rotation of the central stalk assembly together with the membrane-embedded ring of c-subunits driven by the trans-membrane proton-motive force, while the alpha and beta-subunits of F(1) are prevented from co-rotating by their attachment to the peripheral stalk. In the absence of structures of either the intact peripheral stalk or larger complexes containing it, we are studying its individual components and their interactions to build up an overall picture of its structure. Here, we describe an NMR structural characterisation of F(6), which is a 76-residue protein located in the peripheral stalk of the bovine ATP synthase and is essential for coupling between the proton-motive force and catalysis. Isolated F(6) has a highly flexible structure comprising two helices packed together through a loose hydrophobic core and connected by an unstructured linker. Analysis of chemical shifts, (15)N relaxation and RDC measurements confirm that the F(6) structure is flexible on a wide range of timescales ranging from nanoseconds to seconds. The relationship between this structure for isolated F(6) and its role in the intact peripheral stalk is discussed.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases', 'Myocardium', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",15327958,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.325.750', 'D08.811.913.696.650.150.500.750', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.875.500.750', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.875.500.750', 'D12.776.543.585.475.625', 'D12.776.575.750.625'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23331,"Denosumab in patients with giant-cell tumour of bone: a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study.","BACKGROUND: Giant-cell tumour of bone (GCTB) is a rare, locally aggressive osteoclastogenic stromal tumour of the bone. This phase 2 study aimed to assess the safety and activity of denosumab in patients with surgically salvageable or unsalvageable GCTB.METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study done at 30 sites in 12 countries we enrolled adults and skeletally mature adolescents (aged ?12 years) weighing at least 45 kg with histologically confirmed and radiographically measurable GCTB, Karnofsky performance status 50% or higher (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0, 1, or 2), and measurable active disease within 1 year of study enrolment. Patients had surgically unsalvageable GCTB (cohort 1), had surgically salvageable GCTB with planned surgery expected to result in severe morbidity (cohort 2), or were enrolled from a previous study of denosumab for GCTB (cohort 3). Patients received 120 mg subcutaneous denosumab once every 4 weeks during the treatment phase, with loading doses (120 mg subcutaneously) administered on study days 8 and 15 to patients in cohorts 1 and 2 (patients in cohort 3 did not receive loading doses). The primary endpoint was safety in terms of the type, frequency, and severity of adverse events; secondary endpoints included time to disease progression from cohort 1 and the proportion of patients without surgery at month 6 for cohort 2. The safety analysis set included all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of denosumab. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00680992, and has been completed.FINDINGS: Between Sept 9, 2008, and Feb 25, 2016, 532 patients were enrolled: 267 in cohort 1, 253 in cohort 2, and 12 in cohort 3. At data cutoff on Feb 24, 2017, median follow-up was 58·1 months (IQR 34·0-74·4) in the overall patient population, and 65·8 months (40·9-82·4) in cohort 1, 53·4 months (28·2-64·1) in cohort 2, and 76·4 months (61·2-76·5) in cohort 3. During the treatment phase, the most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were hypophosphataemia (24 [5%] of 526 patients), osteonecrosis of the jaw (17 [3%], pain in extremity (12 [2%]), and anaemia (11 [2%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 138 (26%) of 526 patients; the most common were osteonecrosis of the jaw (17 [3%]), anaemia (6 [1%]), bone giant cell tumour (6 [1%]), and back pain (5 [1%]). 28 (5%) patients had positively adjudicated osteonecrosis of the jaw, four (1%) had atypical femur fracture, and four (1%) had hypercalcaemia occurring 30 days after denosumab discontinuation. There were four cases (1%) of sarcomatous transformation, consistent with historical data. Ten (2%) treatment-emergent deaths occurred (two of which were considered treatment-related; bone sarcoma in cohort 2 and sarcoma in cohort 1). Median time to progression or recurrence for patients in cohort 1 during the first treatment phase was not reached (28 [11%] of 262 patients had progression or recurrence). 227 (92%; 95% CI 87-95) of 248 patients who received at least one dose of denosumab in cohort 2 had no surgery in the first 6 months of the study.INTERPRETATION: The types and frequencies of adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of denosumab, which showed long-term disease control for patients with GCTB with unresectable and resectable tumours. Our results suggest that the overall risk to benefit ratio for denosumab treatment in patients with GCTB remains favourable.FUNDING: Amgen.","['Adult', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents', 'Bone Neoplasms', 'Denosumab', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Giant Cell Tumor of Bone', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",31704134,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.696.242'], ['C04.588.149', 'C05.116.231'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.060.782', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.060.782', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.200.782'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C04.557.450.565.380.380', 'C04.557.450.565.575.420'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
37441,The stream/bounce effect occurs for luminance- and disparity-defined motion targets.,"We generalised the stream/bounce effect to dynamic random element displays containing luminance- or disparity-defined targets. Previous studies investigating audio-visual interactions in this context have exclusively employed motion sequences with luminance-defined disks or squares and have focused on properties of the accompanying brief stimuli rather than the visual properties of the motion targets. We found that the presence of a brief sound temporally close to coincidence, or a visual flash at coincidence significantly promote bounce perception for motion targets defined by either luminance contrast or disparity contrast. A brief tone significantly promoted bouncing of luminance-defined targets above a no-sound baseline when it was presented at least 250 ms before coincidence and 100 ms after coincidence. A similar pattern was observed for disparity-defined targets, though the tone promoted bouncing above the no-sound baseline when presented at least 350 ms before and 300 ms after coincidence. We further explored the temporal properties of audio-visual interactions for these two display types and found that bounce perception saturated at similar durations after coincidence. The stream/bounce illusion manifests itself in dynamic random-element displays and is similar for luminance- and disparity-defined motion targets.","['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Auditory Perception', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Discrimination, Psychological', 'Humans', 'Motion Perception', 'Optical Illusions', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Vision, Ocular']",22896912,"[['E02.037', 'E02.190.888.030', 'E05.723.136'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['F02.463.593.071', 'G07.888.125'], ['E01.370.380.850.950.500', 'F02.463.593.778.435.110', 'F02.463.593.932.281', 'F02.463.593.932.901.500', 'G14.940.500'], ['F02.463.593.257'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.593.932.567'], ['F02.463.593.446.659'], ['E05.723.729'], ['F02.830.816.964', 'G02.111.820.480.900', 'G04.835.480.900', 'G11.561.790.964', 'G14.935']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
40385,"Flavobacterium antarcticum sp. nov., a novel psychrotolerant bacterium isolated from the Antarctic.","A yellow-pigmented, Gram-negative and aerobic bacterial strain, designated AT1026(T), was isolated from a terrestrial sample from the Antarctic. Results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the Antarctic isolate belonged to the genus Flavobacterium, with the highest sequence similarity to Flavobacterium tegetincola (96.4 %). Cells were non-motile, non-gliding and psychrotolerant, with optimum and maximum temperatures of about 20 and 25 degrees C. Flexirubins were absent. The major isoprenoid quinone (MK-6), predominant cellular fatty acids (iso-C(15 : 1) G, iso-C(15 : 0) and a mixture of C(16 : 1)omega7c and/or iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH) and DNA G+C content (38 mol%) of the Antarctic isolate were consistent with those of the genus Flavobacterium. In contrast, several phenotypic characters can be used to differentiate this isolate from other flavobacteria. The polyphasic data presented in this study indicated that this isolate should be classified as a novel species in the genus Flavobacterium. The name Flavobacterium antarcticum sp. nov. is therefore proposed for the Antarctic isolate; the type strain is AT1026(T) (=IMSNU 14042(T)=KCTC 12222(T)=JCM 12383(T)).","['Antarctic Regions', 'Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Cold Temperature', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'DNA, Ribosomal', 'Fatty Acids', 'Flavobacterium', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Soil Microbiology']",15774636,"[['Z01.158'], ['E01.370.225.875.150.125', 'E05.200.875.150.125'], ['G01.906.595.272', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.300', 'G16.500.750.775.710.300', 'N06.230.300.100.725.154', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.300'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['D13.444.308.475'], ['D10.251'], ['B03.440.080.190.250', 'B03.440.400.425.310.250'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.695'], ['D13.444.735.686.670'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.555', 'N06.850.425.300']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1
7999,The role of pregabalin in relieving ureteral stent-related symptoms: a randomized controlled clinical trial.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the role of pregabalin in relieving USRS in patients with an indwelling double-J (DJ) stents.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 500 adult patients with a unilateral single ureteral stone who underwent ureteroscopic stone management and required DJ stent insertion were prospectively included in our study. Patients were blindly assigned into four groups A, B, C and D. Those in group A were managed with combination of solifenacin 5-mg tablets and pregabalin 75-mg capsules bid. Patients in group B were managed with solifenacin 5-mg tablets. Those in group C were managed with pregabalin 75-mg capsules bid. Those in group D were control group. All patients were evaluated on day 15 postoperatively for stent-related symptoms using the Arabic translated and validated ureteral stent symptom questionnaire (USSQ).RESULTS: The total USSQ score as well as general health index was significantly lower in group A as compared to other groups. In addition, urinary symptom index was significantly improved in both groups A and B as compared to group C and group D. Pain symptom index was significantly improved in both groups A and C as compared to groups B and D. No statistically significant difference was reported regarding sexual index and work performance index among the whole study groups.CONCLUSION: Pregabalin appears to be a well-tolerated, safe and effective drug in reducing most of USRS, especially relief of pain with subsequent improvement of patient's quality of life. Its combination with solifenacin should be considered to manage patients with USRS as it shows a significant improvement in total USSQ score and general health index when compared to each drug alone.","['Adult', 'Analgesics', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Flank Pain', 'Hematuria', 'Humans', 'Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregabalin', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Solifenacin Succinate', 'Stents', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Ureter', 'Ureteral Calculi', 'Urological Agents']",28260223,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.696.663.850.014', 'D27.505.954.427.040'], ['E02.319.310'], ['C23.888.592.612.386'], ['C12.777.934.442', 'C13.351.968.934.442', 'C23.550.414.849'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.942.343'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.241.081.114.500.350.500', 'D12.125.190.350.450'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['C12.294.644', 'C13.351.500.665'], ['E05.318.370.850', 'N05.715.360.325.730', 'N06.850.520.445.850'], ['D03.605.687.900', 'D03.633.100.531.820.594'], ['E07.695.750'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['A05.810.776'], ['C12.777.725.938.500', 'C12.777.967.374.500', 'C12.777.967.500.851', 'C13.351.968.725.938.500', 'C13.351.968.967.374.500', 'C13.351.968.967.500.851', 'C23.300.175.850.750'], ['D27.505.954.944']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
23515,Classifying health-related behaviours: exploring similarities and differences amongst behaviours.,"OBJECTIVES: The classification of health behaviours may provide a useful framework for understanding their characteristics and therefore the ways in which they are similar and different. However, to date, little research has attempted to identify these characteristics and explore the dimensions along which behaviours differ. This paper uses an inductive approach to explore this issue.DESIGN AND METHODS: In Study 1, 25 repertory grid interviews and 3 focus groups encompassing lay public and health professionals identified 25 ways of describing health behaviours. These were refined into 11 key characteristics. In Study 2, 180 members of the general public rated 20 health behaviours on each of these characteristics.RESULTS: Principal components analysis indicated behaviours were perceived along three key dimensions: 'easy immediate pay-offs' versus 'effortful long-term pay-offs'; 'private unproblematic' versus 'public and problematic'; and 'important routines' versus 'unimportant one-offs'. Risk behaviours were clearly differentiated being perceived as 'easy immediate pay-offs' and 'public-problematic'. In contrast with other approach behaviours such as diet or self-examination, physical activity behaviours were perceived as 'effortful long-term pay-offs'.CONCLUSIONS: This research provides an useful starting point in the development of a framework that allows us to better understand differences and similarities between health behaviours. These dimensions may be important to consider when researchers set out to predict or change behaviour.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'England', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Young Adult']",19646330,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F01.145.317.269'], ['Z01.542.363.300'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['E05.318.308.112', 'N05.715.360.300.269', 'N06.850.520.308.112'], ['F01.145.488'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['E05.318.308.980.438', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.669.599'], ['F01.829.458'], ['E01.370.500', 'E05.318.308.980.438.580', 'N02.421.726.233.443', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.580', 'N06.850.780.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['D27.505.696.706.776.800', 'D27.505.954.444.695', 'D27.720.269.800', 'D27.720.799.763.764'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

34523,Are absences truly generalized seizures or partial seizures originating from or predominantly involving the pre-motor areas? Some clinical and theoretical observations and their implications for seizure classification.,"In both the current (1981) ILAE Classification of Epileptic Seizures and the recently Proposed Diagnostic Scheme for People with Epilepsy and Epileptic Seizures, typical absence seizures are defined as generalized seizures, implying widespread subcortical and cortical neuronal involvement from onset with impairment of consciousness as the clinical hallmark. Clinical observations from three patients and clinical and experimental data from the literature suggest, however, that: (1) consciousness is retained in many typical absences; (2) the true hallmark of these seizures is arrest of motor initiation due to disturbance of pre-motor area frontal-lobe function; (3) typical absences and partial seizures from these areas may show similar clinical and EEG features and involve the same neuronal circuits. The neuronal system primarily involved in these seizures consists of a relatively limited cortico-thalamo-cortical circuit, including the reticular thalamic nucleus, the thalamocortical relay and the predominantly anterior and mesial frontal cerebral cortex, with the cortex probably acting as the primary driving site. Typical absences thus should not be classified or defined as generalized seizures, particularly since neuropathological and imaging studies increasingly argue for localized structural abnormalities, even in idiopathic or primary generalized epilepsy. These observations further highlight the intrinsic weaknesses of the current classification system for seizures and support further adaptations of the diagnostic system currently under development.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Consciousness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsies, Partial', 'Epilepsy, Absence', 'Epilepsy, Generalized', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Video Recording']",16854562,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F02.463.188.409', 'F02.830.233'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['C10.228.140.490.360'], ['C10.228.140.490.375.260', 'C10.228.140.490.493.125'], ['C10.228.140.490.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.280.960']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
29480,Impact of abomasal nematodes on roe deer and chamois body condition in an alpine environment.,"Abomasal helminths were examined from 101 roe deer and 43 chamois, shot or found-dead, in the period July-November 1993-95, in the Parco Naturale Paneveggio Pale di San Martino (Italian Eastern Alps). Twelve helminth species were observed in both roe deer and chamois. For both host species, discriminant analysis, using the abundance of each parasite species in the hosts, failed to distinguish between subjects from each of the three study years. For 44 roe deer and 27 chamois data on body weight, body length, foot length, withers height, thoracic circumference and kidney fat index were also available. Principal Component Analysis was performed on the biometrical data in order to group related variables into a few compound variables. In both host species it was possible to identify two principal components, with an explained variance > 80%: the first component, led by body length, was an expression of skeletal development and the second, led by kidney fat index, of nutritional status. Parasite abundance and richness appeared to be negatively correlated with the scores of both skeletal and nutritional Components in the two host species, although only the correlation between parasite abundance and the scores of the nutritional component in roe deer was statistically significant (Spearman r = -0.411; p < 0.05). These results support the susceptibility of roe deer to abomasal helminths, which could be important considering the spatial and nutritional interspecific competition between domestic and wild ruminants often recorded in alpine environments.","['Abomasum', 'Animals', 'Biometry', 'Cold Climate', 'Deer', 'Disease Reservoirs', 'Female', 'Goat Diseases', 'Goats', 'Health Status', 'Helminthiasis, Animal', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases', 'Species Specificity', 'Stomach Diseases']",9802085,"[['A13.869.106'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.318.740.225', 'N06.850.505.200'], ['G16.500.275.071.275', 'N06.230.300.100.250.275'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.373'], ['N06.850.520.203.250'], ['C22.405'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.513'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['C01.610.335.349', 'C01.610.701.377', 'C22.674.377'], ['Z01.542.489'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['C22.836'], ['G16.824'], ['C06.405.748']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

In addition to seizures, there was a marked decline in school performance. At the age of 14 years, sodium valproate was started as add-on therapy; 2 weeks later he was hospitalized in a stuporous state. The serum level of valproate was within the therapeutic range. Cognitive evaluation disclosed moderate mental retardation. No metabolic abnormalities were detected. Valproate was discontinued and during the 4 following months, a slow but significant improvement was documented in cognitive functions. Repeated assessment was within the range of mild mental retardation. Initially, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild cortical atrophy. A subsequent MRI study performed 2 years later was normal.","['Adolescent', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Atrophy', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsies, Myoclonic', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Recovery of Function', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Valproic Acid']",10726594,"[['M01.060.057'], ['D27.505.954.427.080'], ['C23.300.070'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['F03.615.250'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['C10.228.140.490.375.130', 'C10.228.140.490.493.063'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['G16.757'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['D02.241.081.944.509.900', 'D10.251.400.895.593.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
17517,Recovery-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy for recent-onset bipolar disorder: randomised controlled pilot trial.,"BACKGROUND: Despite evidence for the effectiveness of structured psychological therapies for bipolar disorder no psychological interventions have been specifically designed to enhance personal recovery for individuals with recent-onset bipolar disorder.AIMS: A pilot study to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a new intervention, recovery-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), designed in collaboration with individuals with recent-onset bipolar disorder intended to improve clinical and personal recovery outcomes.METHOD: A single, blind randomised controlled trial compared treatment as usual (TAU) with recovery-focused CBT plus TAU (n = 67).RESULTS: Recruitment and follow-up rates within 10% of pre-planned targets to 12-month follow-up were achieved. An average of 14.15 h (s.d. = 4.21) of recovery-focused CBT were attended out of a potential maximum of 18 h. Compared with TAU, recovery-focused CBT significantly improved personal recovery up to 12-month follow-up (Bipolar Recovery Questionnaire mean score 310.87, 95% CI 75.00-546.74 (s.e. = 120.34), P = 0.010, d = 0.62) and increased time to any mood relapse during up to 15 months follow-up (÷2 = 7.64, P<0.006, estimated hazard ratio (HR) = 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.78). Groups did not differ with respect to medication adherence.CONCLUSIONS: Recovery-focused CBT seems promising with respect to feasibility and potential clinical effectiveness.

Data collected included demographics, mechanism of injury, x-ray rate, and time in hard collar. Data analysis was by chi-square test for proportions and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. There were 211 patients studied. The x-ray ordering rate decreased from 67% to 50% (25% relative reduction, p = 0.0187). Time in hard collar was also reduced from a median of 128 min to a median of 103 min (effect size 25.5 min), but this did not reach statistical significance.

8946,Second-generation pseudorabies virus vaccine with deletions in thymidine kinase and glycoprotein genes.,"A modified-live pseudorabies virus (PRV) vaccine, designated PRV(dlg92/d1tk), with deletions in the thymidine kinase (tk) and glycoprotein-gIII (g92) genes, was derived from the PRV (Bucharest [BUK]-d13) vaccine strain. The vaccine virus also contained a deletion in glycoprotein gI. Despite 3 deletions, PRV(dlg92/d1tk) replicated to high titers in cell culture from 30 C to 39.1 C. Enzyme assays and autoradiography revealed that PRV(dlg92/d1tk) did not induce a functional tk activity in infected tk- RAB(BU) cells (rabbit skin). Rabbit skin cells were infected with PRV(dlg92/d1tk), with vaccine strains derived from BUK or Bartha K strains of PRV or with the virulent Illinois (ILL), Indiana-Funkhauser (IND-F), and Aujeszky (Auj) strains of PRV and were labeled with [3H]mannose from 4 or 5 to 24 hours after infection to investigate whether these viruses induced the synthesis of glycoprotein gIII. Nonionic detergent extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with antisera from pigs vaccinated with tk(-)-PRV(BUK-d13) or tk+-Bartha K, pigs vaccinated with tk+-PRV(BUK) strains and then challenge exposed to tk+-PRV(IND-F), naturally infected domestic or feral pigs, and pigs vaccinated with tk-)-PRV(dlg92/d1tk). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against PRV glycoproteins gIII, gp50, and gII were also studied. After immunoprecipitation, labeled PRV-specific proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The PRV glycoprotein-gII complex, but not glycoprotein gIII, was synthesized in PRV(dlg92/d1tk)-infected cells. Glycoprotein gII and gIII were made in cells infected with PRV vaccine strains BUK, Bartha K, and BUK-d13 and with virulent PRV strains ILL, IND-F, and Auj. Cells infected with PRV(dlg92/d1tk) and with PRV strains ILL, IND-F, Auj, Bartha K, BUK, and BUK-d13, excreted into the cell culture medium a highly sulfated glycoprotein gX of about 90 kilodaltons.

43618,Molecular characterization of Porcine circovirus type 2 isolates from post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome-affected and non-affected pigs.,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is recognized as a primary cause in post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). In this study, both PCV1 and PCV2 types were studied in pigs originating from PMWS-affected (+) and non-affected (-) herds from Brittany. PCV2 was identified by PCR in 100 % of animals from PMWS(+) herds and in 76 % from PMWS(-) herds, while PCV1 was not detected. The complete sequences of 38 PCV2 isolates were determined and 23 new variants were identified, displaying between 94.6 and 99.9 % nucleotide identity with one another. Although highly related to all the PCV2 sequences available in databases, the isolates from France gathered in a distinct subcluster. Compared with the 13 PCV2 from PMWS(+) farms, the 10 PMWS(-) sequences exhibited a slightly higher variability. No viral molecular marker specific to a pathogenic state could be identified, even by including other PCV2 variants isolated from PMWS-suffering animals from other countries. We concluded that the PMWS outbreaks in Brittany are most likely not due to the emergence of a new genotype of circovirus.","['Animals', 'Circoviridae Infections', 'Circovirus', 'DNA, Viral', 'France', 'Genetic Variation', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Swine', 'Swine Diseases', 'Wasting Syndrome']",14769887,"[['B01.050'], ['C01.925.256.200'], ['B04.280.120.150'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['G05.365'], ['E05.318.416', 'E05.393.522', 'H01.158.201.636.475.500', 'H01.158.273.343.595.475.500', 'H01.181.122.650.475.550', 'H02.403.720.500.300', 'N06.850.520.470'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['G02.111.810.550', 'G05.810.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['C22.905'], ['C18.452.915', 'C18.654.940']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1
24162,MIBG-treatment in neuroblastoma; experiences of the T?bingen/Frankfurt group.,"27 children with neuroblastoma were treated with 131I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MBIG). They were either refractory to conventional therapy or experienced relapse after initially successful treatment. 7 children revealed stage IV and 20 stage III at the beginning of MIBG-treatment. MIBG was administered by infusion lasting from 30 min to 30 hrs. In most children the dose was split into two portions each infused over a period of 4 hrs with a 24 hrs interval between. Courses were repeated up to 6 times and maximum activity given to one patient cumulatively was 38,221 MBq. 24 patients were evaluable for analysis of results. In 4 children (16.7%) a CR was observed, in 10 (41.7%) a PR, in 5 (20.8%) a disease stabilization and 5 were nonresponders. The 4 CR-patients were initially stage IV. 3 of them were treated in addition by bone marrow transplantation (bmt), one by further chemotherapy. 3 died of a relapse, 1 of complications from bmt. 5 of the 10 PR-patients died of tumor progression, 3 achieved a CR by additional chemotherapy, 1 a PR by bmt and 1 stays in PR without further measures. 2 of the 5 children with a disease stabilization were the first treated patients to whom a fairly low dose was given. In 3 of the 5 nonresponders no uptake of MIBG was observed; they died from tumor progression. 1 of the 2 nonresponders with uptake died of graft-versus-host disease after bmt, 1 other also of tumor progression. Duration of remission was between 1 and 12 months and depended upon uptake and dose of MIBG, interval between administrations and individual tumor behaviour. Side effects were seen as marked bone marrow depression; this was reversible in any case and we did not loose a patient due to MIBG-induced leuko- or thrombopenia. In cases of severely ill children we observed a very fast and dramatical amelioration in clinical conditions. With this method even in neuroblastoma relapse and in nonresponders complete remissions are achievable. Important is the intensification of the therapeutical effect by additional chemotherapy or in combination with bmt. For a definitive evaluation further investigations are necessary to optimize therapeutic strategies.","['3-Iodobenzylguanidine', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Iodobenzenes', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma']",3406023,"[['D02.078.370.510', 'D02.455.426.559.389.454.300', 'D02.455.526.581.496.300'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.454', 'D02.455.526.581.496'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.590.650.550', 'C04.557.470.670.590.650.550', 'C04.557.580.625.600.590.650.550']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
27314,Treatment of scedosporiosis with voriconazole: clinical experience with 107 patients.,"The efficacy of voriconazole in 107 patients with scedosporiosis was analyzed. Principal infection sites were the lungs/sinuses (24%), central nervous system (CNS) (20%), and bone (18%), while 21% of patients had disseminated infection. Solid organ transplantation (22%), hematological malignancy (21%), and surgery/trauma (15%) were the predominant underlying conditions. A successful therapeutic response was achieved in 57% of patients (median, 103 therapy days), with > 98% of those responding receiving > or = 28 days of therapy. Patients receiving primary therapy showed a 61% response versus 56% for the others. The best therapeutic responses were seen for skin/subcutaneous (91%) or bone (79%) infections, and the lowest for CNS infections (43%). Patients without major immune suppression (72%) or those with solid organ transplantation (63%) or various hematological conditions (60%) showed the best responses by underlying condition. Median known survival time was 133 days (therapy successes, 252 days; failures, 21 days). In all, 43 (40%) patients died, 73% due to scedosporiosis. Patients with Scedosporium prolificans infection had significantly reduced survival times (P = 0.0259) and were more likely to die from fungal infection (P = 0.002) than were Scedosporium apiospermum-infected patients. In a subset of 43 patients where voriconazole baseline MICs were available, response to voriconazole was higher for S. apiospermum-infected patients (54% response; MIC(50), 0.25 microg/ml) than for S. prolificans-infected patients (40% response; MIC(50), 4.0 microg/ml). Voriconazole demonstrated clinically useful activity in the treatment of both S. apiospermum and S. prolificans infections and was well tolerated.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Aspergillosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrimidines', 'Scedosporium', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles', 'Voriconazole']",18212110,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D27.505.954.122.136'], ['C01.150.703.080'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.318.372.250.250', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250'], ['E05.318.308.980.438', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.383.742'], ['B01.300.107.796', 'B01.300.381.785'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D03.383.129.799'], ['D03.383.129.799.950']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
19218,Role of refractory period in homoclinic models of neural synchronization.,"We study the properties of a homoclinic model of neuron by introducing a suitable one-dimensional map. We show that the system is characterized by a response time to external signals which is a decreasing function of the signal strength, in contrast to excitable models whose response time is signal-independent. In a one-dimensional array of these systems with bidirectional coupling, we observe a sudden transition to a synchronized state at a certain value of the coupling strength. The transition occurs when the response time of a site to the signals of the adjacent sites is of the order of refractory time. Near the transition, we find an intermittent behavior due to the competition between a turbulent and a synchronized state. The observed behavior distinguishes homoclinic systems from excitable systems.","['Action Potentials', 'Cortical Synchronization', 'Models, Neurological', 'Neurons']",17565504,"[['G04.580.100', 'G07.265.675.100', 'G11.561.570.100'], ['E01.370.376.300.437.500', 'E01.370.405.245.575.500', 'G07.265.256.249'], ['E05.599.395.642'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
44352,Application of surfactant assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction for sample preparation of chlorophenols in water samples.,"A simple, rapid, and efficient method, based on surfactant assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (SA-DLLME), followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been developed for the extraction and determination of chlorophenols as model compounds in environmental water samples. A conventional cationic surfactant called cethyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as a disperser agent in the proposed approach. Thirty-five microliter of 1-octanol as an extraction solvent was injected rapidly into 11 mL aqueous sample containing 0.09 mmol L(-1) of CTAB, the mixture was then shaken for 3 min to disperse the organic phase. Having the extraction procedure been completed, the mixture was centrifuged and 20 ìL of collected phase was injected into HPLC for subsequent analysis. Some parameters such as the type and volume of the extraction solvent, the type and concentration of surfactant, pH, ionic strength, shaking time, extraction temperature and centrifugation time were optimized. The preconcentration factors (PFs) in a range of 187-353 were obtained under the optimum conditions. The linear range, detection limit (S/N=3), and precision (n=5) were 0.2-200, 0.1 ìg L(-1), and 4.7-6.9%, respectively. Tap water, sea water and mineral water samples were successfully analyzed for the existence of chlorophenols using the proposed method.","['Cetrimonium', 'Cetrimonium Compounds', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chlorophenols', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Solvents', 'Surface-Active Agents', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",20875589,"[['D02.092.877.883.111.500', 'D02.675.276.190.500'], ['D02.092.877.883.111', 'D02.675.276.190'], ['E05.196.155'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.261.190', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.190'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['G02.300'], ['D27.720.844'], ['D27.720.877'], ['D27.888.284.903.655']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
11133,Dual-band perfect absorber for multispectral plasmon-enhanced infrared spectroscopy.,"Metamaterial-based perfect absorbers utilize intrinsic loss, with the aid of appropriate structural design, to achieve near unity absorption at a certain wavelength. For most of the reported absorbers, the absorption occurs only at a single wavelength where plasmon resonances are excited in the nanostructures. Here we introduce a dual-band perfect absorber based on a gold nanocross structure. Two bands of maximum absorption of 94% are experimentally accomplished by breaking the symmetry of the cross structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate the two bands can be readily tuned throughout the mid-infrared with their associated resonances giving rise to large near-field enhancements. These features are ideal for multiband surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy applications. We experimentally demonstrate this application by simultaneously detecting two molecular vibrational modes of a 4 nm thick polymer film utilizing our proposed absorber. Furthermore, in response to variations in the interaction strength between the plasmonic and molecular dipoles, we observe an anticrossing behavior and modification in the spectral line shape of the molecular absorption peak, which are characteristic of the coupling between the two modes.","['Absorption', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Gold', 'Light', 'Metal Nanoparticles', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance']",22920565,"[['G01.015', 'G02.010', 'G03.015', 'G03.787.024', 'G07.690.725.015'], ['E05.320'], ['E05.325.192'], ['D01.268.556.322', 'D01.268.956.186', 'D01.552.544.322'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['J01.637.512.600.500'], ['E05.196.822', 'G01.867'], ['E05.196.712.726.676', 'E05.196.867.826.676'], ['E05.196.890', 'E05.601.043.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
16972,Increased Variance in Oral and Gastric Microbiome Correlates With Esophagectomy Anastomotic Leak.,"BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leak after esophagectomy remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality. The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome has been found to play a significant role in tumor oncogenesis and postoperative bowel anastomotic leak. We hypothesized that the GI microbiome could differentiate between esophageal cancer histologies and predict postoperative anastomotic leak.METHODS: A prospective study of esophagectomy patients was performed from May 2013 to August 2014, with the collection of oral saliva, intraoperative esophageal and gastric mucosa, and samples of postoperative infections (neck swab or sputum). The presence and level for each bacterial probe as end points were used to analyze correlations with tumor histology, tumor stage, and presence of postoperative complications by unequal variances t tests for multiple comparisons and principal coordinate analysis.RESULTS: Esophagectomy was successful in 55 of 66 patients who were enrolled. Among those, the diagnosis was adenocarcinoma in 44 (80%) squamous cell carcinoma in (13%), and benign disease in 4 (7%). The 30-day mortality was 1.8% (1 of 55). Complications included anastomotic leak requiring local drainage in 18% (10 of 55) and postoperative pneumonia in 2% (1 of 55). No correlation was noted between GI microbiome flora and tumor histology or tumor stage. A significant difference (p = 0.015) was found when the variance in bacterial composition between the preoperative oral flora was compared with intraoperative gastric flora in patients who had a leak but not in patients with pneumonia.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with anastomotic leaks had increased variance in their preoperative oral and gastric flora. Microbiome analysis could help identify patients at higher risk for leak after esophagectomy.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Aged', 'Anastomotic Leak', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Esophageal Mucosa', 'Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Esophagectomy', 'Female', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth', 'Prospective Studies']",29307454,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C23.550.767.071'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['A03.556.875.500.180', 'A10.615.550.146'], ['C04.588.274.476.205', 'C04.588.443.353', 'C06.301.371.205', 'C06.405.117.430', 'C06.405.249.205'], ['E04.210.346'], ['A03.556.875.875.440', 'A10.615.550.291'], ['G06.591.375', 'G16.500.275.157.049.100.500.375', 'N06.230.124.049.100.500.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A01.456.505.631', 'A03.556.500', 'A14.549'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
26910,Femtosecond response of polyatomic molecules to ultra-intense hard X-rays.,"X-ray free-electron lasers enable the investigation of the structure and dynamics of diverse systems, including atoms, molecules, nanocrystals and single bioparticles, under extreme conditions. Many imaging applications that target biological systems and complex materials use hard X-ray pulses with extremely high peak intensities (exceeding 1020 watts per square centimetre). However, fundamental investigations have focused mainly on the individual response of atoms and small molecules using soft X-rays with much lower intensities. Studies with intense X-ray pulses have shown that irradiated atoms reach a very high degree of ionization, owing to multiphoton absorption, which in a heteronuclear molecular system occurs predominantly locally on a heavy atom (provided that the absorption cross-section of the heavy atom is considerably larger than those of its neighbours) and is followed by efficient redistribution of the induced charge. In serial femtosecond crystallography of biological objects-an application of X-ray free-electron lasers that greatly enhances our ability to determine protein structure-the ionization of heavy atoms increases the local radiation damage that is seen in the diffraction patterns of these objects and has been suggested as a way of phasing the diffraction data. On the basis of experiments using either soft or less-intense hard X-rays, it is thought that the induced charge and associated radiation damage of atoms in polyatomic molecules can be inferred from the charge that is induced in an isolated atom under otherwise comparable irradiation conditions. Here we show that the femtosecond response of small polyatomic molecules that contain one heavy atom to ultra-intense (with intensities approaching 1020 watts per square centimetre), hard (with photon energies of 8.3 kiloelectronvolts) X-ray pulses is qualitatively different: our experimental and modelling results establish that, under these conditions, the ionization of a molecule is considerably enhanced compared to that of an individual heavy atom with the same absorption cross-section. This enhancement is driven by ultrafast charge transfer within the molecule, which refills the core holes that are created in the heavy atom, providing further targets for inner-shell ionization and resulting in the emission of more than 50 electrons during the X-ray pulse. Our results demonstrate that efficient modelling of X-ray-driven processes in complex systems at ultrahigh intensities is feasible.","['Crystallography', 'Electrons', 'Iodine', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Photons', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Static Electricity', 'Time Factors', 'X-Rays']",28569799,"[['E05.196.309', 'H01.181.529.240'], ['G01.249.335', 'G01.358.500.750'], ['D01.268.380.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E07.632.490', 'E07.710.520'], ['G01.249.705', 'G01.358.500.505.650.782', 'G01.590.540.782', 'G01.750.250.650.782', 'G01.750.770.578.782'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['D12.776'], ['G01.358.500.249.820'], ['G01.910.857'], ['G01.358.500.505.970', 'G01.750.250.970', 'G01.750.750.918']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
24335,Exteriorization of thoracic duct lymph. Theoretical considerations and an experimental model.,"Successful manipulation of the immune response will ultimately provide the answers for controlling homograft rejection, reversing autoimmune states, and quite possibly for curing carcinoma and other malignant neoplasms. During the past decade, many new drugs and techniques have been developed that alter the immune state. The theoretical basis for approaching the immune system via the thoracic duct is based on the fact that 90% to 95% of the cells in thoracic duct lymph are thymus-derived lymphocytes.

36727,"Deoxyribonucleoside kinases belonging to the thymidine kinase 2 (TK2)-like group vary significantly in substrate specificity, kinetics and feed-back regulation.","In eukaryotic cells deoxyribonucleoside kinases belonging to three phylogenetic sub-families have been found: (i) thymidine kinase 1 (TK1)-like enzymes, which are strictly pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside-specific kinases; (ii) TK2-like enzymes, which include pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside kinases and a single multisubstrate kinase from Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK); and (iii) deoxycytidine/deoxyguanosine kinase (dCK/dGK)-like enzymes, which are deoxycytidine and/or purine deoxyribonucleoside-specific kinases. We cloned and characterized two new deoxyribonucleoside kinases belonging to the TK2-like group from the insect Bombyx mori and the amphibian Xenopus laevis. The deoxyribonucleoside kinase from B. mori (Bm-dNK) turned out to be a multisubstrate kinase like Dm-dNK. But uniquely for a deoxyribonucleoside kinase, Bm-dNK displayed positive cooperativity with all four natural deoxyribonucleoside substrates. The deoxyribonucleoside kinase from X. laevis (Xen-PyK) resembled closely the human and mouse TK2 enzymes displaying their characteristic Michaelis-Menten kinetic with deoxycytidine and negative cooperativity with its second natural substrate thymidine. Bm-dNK, Dm-dNK and Xen-PyK were shown to be homodimers. Significant differences in the feedback inhibition by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates between these three enzymes were found. The insect multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinases Bm-dNK and Dm-dNK were only inhibited by thymidine triphosphate, while Xen-PyK was inhibited by thymidine and deoxycytidine triphosphate in a complex pattern depending on the deoxyribonucleoside substrate. The broad substrate specificity and different feedback regulation of the multisubstrate insect deoxyribonucleoside kinases may indicate that these enzymes have a different functional role than the other members of the TK2-like group.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bombyx', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Deoxycytidine', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thymidine Kinase', 'Xenopus laevis']",11812127,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.937.650.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400.325', 'L01.470.750.750.325'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500', 'D13.570.230.329', 'D13.570.685.245.500'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.750.310.250.500'], ['G07.410.732'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.940.350', 'G07.690.936.563'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D08.811.913.696.620'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.550'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['E05.393.751'], ['G05.365.590.762', 'G05.558.800'], ['G02.111.835'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.610.500.562']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
26672,Lectin immuno tests: quantitation and titration of antigens and antibodies using lectin-antibody conjugates.,"We have investigated the possibility of using lectin-antibody conjugates as general reagents in immunological procedures requiring a labeled antigen or antibody. Using these conjugates, labeling is achieved through saccharide binding sites of lectins which operate as acceptors for glycoconjugate marker substances added secondarily. Marker substances used in this work were enzymes, radioactively labeled glycoconjugates and erythrocytes, but other markers can also be used. Using the first two markers, antigens and antibodies were determined with accuracy and sensitivity equal to those of conventional enzyme or radioimmunoassays. Using erythrocytes as a marker, a simple erythro-adsorption procedure, possibly followed by hemolysis, has been developed which allowed the titration of antigens and antibodies to be carried out with a sensitivity at least equal to enzyme or radioimmunoassays.","['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens', 'Concanavalin A', 'Erythrocytes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Rabbits', 'Sheep']",7007506,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.257', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.257', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.257', 'D23.050.101'], ['D23.050'], ['D12.776.503.499.500', 'D12.776.765.678.500'], ['A11.118.290', 'A11.443.240', 'A15.145.229.334'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['E05.478.566.350', 'E05.478.583.400', 'E05.601.470.350'], ['E05.478'], ['E05.478.566.380', 'E05.601.470.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
36736,Legal and ethical framework for global health information and biospecimen exchange - an international perspective.,"BACKGROUND: The progress of electronic health technologies and biobanks holds enormous promise for efficient research. Evidence shows that studies based on sharing and secondary use of data/samples have the potential to significantly advance medical knowledge. However, sharing of such resources for international collaboration is hampered by the lack of clarity about ethical and legal requirements for transfer of data and samples across international borders.MAIN TEXT: Here, the International Clinical Trial Center Network (ICN) reports the legal and ethical requirements governing data and sample exchange (DSE) across four continents. The most recurring requirement is ethical approval, whereas only in specific conditions approval of national health authorities is required. Informed consent is not required in all sharing situations. However, waiver of informed consent is only allowed in certain countries/regions and under certain circumstances. The current legal and ethical landscape appears to be very complex and under constant evolution. Regulations differ between countries/regions and are often incomplete, leading to uncertainty.CONCLUSION: With this work, ICN illuminates the unmet need for a single international collaborative framework to facilitate DSE. Harmonising requirements for global DSE will reduce inefficiency and waste in research. There are many challenges to realising this ambitious vision, including inconsistent terminology and definitions, and heterogeneous and dynamic legal constraints. Here, we identify areas of agreement and significant difference as a necessary first step towards facilitating international collaboration. We propose the establishment of a working group to continue the comparison across jurisdictions, create a standardised glossary and define a set of basic principles and fundamental requirements for DSE.","['Electronic Health Records', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination', 'International Cooperation', 'Internationality', 'Ownership', 'Tissue Banks']",31964390,"[['E05.318.308.940.968.625.500', 'N04.452.859.564.650.125', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.530.250', 'N06.850.520.308.940.968.625.250'], ['H02.403.371', 'N01.400.337'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.143.443'], ['I01.615.500'], ['I01.615'], ['I01.880.604.583.594', 'N04.452.633'], ['N02.278.065.900']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0

45474,Aberration correction with soft contact lens: is the postlens tear film important?,"PURPOSE: A number of factors may influence the performance of soft contact lenses designed to correct the aberrations of the eye. Although the effect of many of these factors has been investigated, the effect of postlens tear film has not. We estimated the optical effect of the postlens tear film by using simplified models of postlens tear thickness profiles.METHODS: Three models were analyzed, including (1) a worst-case scenario before lens settling, (2) representative components of thickness profile based on Zernike-like forms, and (3) a series of undulations (ripples) across the postlens tear film. A range of thicknesses of the tear film was studied. Ray-tracing analyses were conducted on all models to calculate the modulation transfer function response between 0 and 100 cycles per degree and Strehl ratio.RESULTS: The results show that in only a few scenarios does the reduction in optical performance because of the postlens tear film approach those introduced by conventional spherical surface soft contact lenses.CONCLUSION: The postlens tear film can introduce discernable amounts of optical degradation in the lens-wearing eye. However, the amount of this effect is likely to be small compared with other sources, and benefits afforded by the use of aberration-corrected soft contact lenses should not be severely affected.","['Computer Simulation', 'Contact Lenses, Hydrophilic', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Refractive Errors', 'Tears']",12772762,"[['L01.224.160'], ['E07.632.500.276.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.599.395'], ['C11.744'], ['A12.200.882']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
23862,[Clinical and morphologic stages in Balkan endemic nephropathy].,"The first clinical classification of Balkan endemic nephropathy was elaborated by A. Puhlev et al in 1960, according to which two stages could be established in the course of the disease-compensated and decompensated. Gradually, many new data accumulated as regards the various aspects of the disease, that cannot be put into the frames of the first clinical classification. On the base of the author's own long-term complex clinical-laboratory, functional, instrumental and nephrobiopsic studies, he admits the existence of four stahes in the clinical and morphological course of the Balkan endemic nephropathy. 1. Initial stage, reflecting the onset of the morbid process. The disease, at that stage, could be diagnosed via some provoking methods or renal biopsy. Morphologically, light alterations in some glomerules were established as well as more severe ones in the cells of the proximal tubules. 2. Subclinical stage - decreet and inconstant manifestations of the disease were established with completely preserved renal function. The size of the kidneys is slightly reduced - bilaterally. The morphological alterations are localized in the glomerules, proximal tubules, small vessels and interstitium. 3. Compensated stage - with manifested renal symptomatics and considerable morphological alterations in renal parenchyma, but still preserved excretory function. 4. Decompensated stage - where the known four stages of the chronic renal insufficiency are included. The classification proposed reflects the dynamics of the advancement of the morbid process. In this way, the most adequate treatment is enabled as well as the prophylaxis and assessment of working capacity and disability of the patients with Balkan endemic nephropathy.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Balkan Nephropathy', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephritis, Interstitial']",6673348,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['C12.777.419.570.643.150', 'C13.351.968.419.570.643.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A05.810.453'], ['C12.777.419.780.750.500', 'C13.351.968.419.780.750.500'], ['A05.810.453.324.359', 'A05.810.453.736.520'], ['A05.810.453.736.560.570'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C12.777.419.570.643', 'C13.351.968.419.570.643']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Strain SSK2-1(T) grew optimally at 30 °C, at pH 7.0-8.0 and in the presence of 2.0% (w/v) NaCl. Neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain SSK2-1(T) clustered with the type strains of two Octadecabacter species, showing 96.5-96.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Strain SSK2-1(T) and Octadecabacter arcticus DSM 13978(T) contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C18 : 1ù7c as the common major fatty acid. The polar lipid profile of strain SSK2-1(T) was similar to that of O. arcticus DSM 13978(T) by having phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol and one unidentified aminolipid as the major components. The DNA G+C content of strain SSK2-1(T) was 60.1 mol%. Differential phenotypic properties, particularly temperature range for growth, oxidase activity and nitrate reduction, together with phylogenetic distinctiveness, revealed that strain SSK2-1(T) is separate from recognized species of the genus Octadecabacter. On the basis of the data presented, strain SSK2-1(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Octadecabacter, for which the name Octadecabacter jejudonensis sp. nov. is proposed.

36674,Premature excitation and onset of reentrant ventricular tachycardia.,"It was hypothesized that quantitative sinus rhythm electrogram measurements could be used to predict conduction events that result from premature stimulation and reentrant ventricular tachycardia inducibility. Sinus rhythm activation and electrogram-duration maps were constructed from bipolar electrograms acquired at 196-312 sites in the epicardial border zone of 43 canine hearts (25 with and 18 without reentrant ventricular tachycardia inducible by premature stimulation). From these maps, lines of electrical discontinuity, where blocks would occur during premature excitation, were estimated. The mean error in distance between the estimated and actual block lines of premature excitation was 0.97 +/- 0.49 cm. Based on the quantitative characteristics of the activation and electrogram-duration maps and the longest block line that formed during premature excitation, it was possible to predict whether reentry would occur (sensitivity, 94.7%; specificity, 79.6%). In reentry experiments, the breakthrough-point location along the unidirectional arc of the block that initiated reentry was also predictable (mean error, 0.79 +/- 0.19 cm). Sinus rhythm measurements are useful to predict conduction events that result from premature stimulation and reentry inducibility.","['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Dogs', 'Gap Junctions', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal', 'Myocardium', 'Pacemaker, Artificial', 'Tachycardia, Ventricular', 'Ventricular Premature Complexes']",12234826,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.085'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['A11.284.149.165.420.471'], ['A10.690.552.500.500', 'A11.620.249'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['E07.305.250.750'], ['C14.280.067.845.940', 'C14.280.123.875.940', 'C23.550.073.845.940'], ['C14.280.067.325.500', 'C14.280.123.375.500', 'C23.550.073.325.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

14373,"Identification and characterization of a centrosomal protein, FOR20 as a novel S100A6 target.","S100A6 is a Ca2+-signal transducer that interacts with numerous proteins and regulates their biochemical functions. Here we identified a centrosomal protein, FOR20 (FOP-related protein of 20 kDa) as a novel S100A6 target by screening protein microarrays carrying 19,676 recombinant GST-fused human proteins. Binding experiments revealed that S100A6 interacts with the N-terminal region (residues 1-30) of FOR20 in a Ca2+-dependent manner in vitro and in living cells. Several S100 proteins including S100A1, A2, A4, A11, B also exhibited Ca2+-dependent interactions with FOR20 as well as S100A6. We found that two distantly related centrosomal proteins, FOP and OFD1, also possess N-terminal regions with a significant sequence similarity to the putative S100A6-binding site (residues 1-30) in FOR20 and are capable of binding to S100A6 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Taken together, these results may indicate that S100A6 interacts with FOR20 and related centrosomal proteins through a conserved N-terminal domain, suggesting a novel Ca2+-dependent regulation of centrosomal function.","['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrosome', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'S100 Calcium Binding Protein A6', 'S100 Proteins', 'Substrate Specificity']",28765046,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210.172.500', 'A11.329.228.220'], ['D12.776.167'], ['A11.251'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750.585.160', 'A11.284.430.214.190.750.820.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.126.110'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.588.570.700', 'E05.601.680'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D12.776'], ['D12.776.157.125.750.532', 'D12.776.167.481'], ['D12.776.157.125.750', 'D12.776.631.655'], ['G02.111.835']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
40447,Serum androgens and estrogens in postmenopausal women with and without endometrial cancer.,"Thirty-five consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the endometrium and an equal number of control subjects matched to the cancer patients for age and percentage of ideal weight were studied prospectively. In the cancer patients, the mean +/- SE serum androstenedione, testosterone, estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) levels were 503 +/- 34 pg/ml, 224 +/- 22 pg/ml, 38.7 +/- 3.6 pg/ml, and 14.5 +/- 0.9 pg/ml, respectively. Similar concentrations were found in the control subjects. Body weight and percentage of ideal weight showed highly significant correlations (P less than 0.001) with E1 and E2 but not with the androgen concentrations in either group. The heavier patients had higher E1 and E2 levels. Age and years since menopause did not correlate with any of the hormonal levels. The cancer patients with overt diabetes tended to be more obese and have higher estrogen levels than did the nondiabetic subjects. Those with a history of prior estrogen usage were more slender and had lower endogenous estrogens than the nonusers. Twenty-three of the cancer patients (66%) had a presumed risk factor(s) for the development of this tumor, that is, excess body weight, high endogenous estrogen levels, or a history of prior estrogen usage. These data support the concept that conditions which lead to continued, unopposed estrogen stimulation may be associated with malignant transformation of the endometrium.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Androgens', 'Diabetes Complications', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Estrone', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Uterine Neoplasms']",7361834,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.696.399.472.161'], ['C19.246.099'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['D27.505.696.399.472.277'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.414', 'D04.210.500.578.502.497', 'D06.472.040.502.497', 'D06.472.334.851.437.996'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800', 'G17.680.750', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800'], ['C04.588.945.418.948', 'C13.351.500.852.762', 'C13.351.937.418.875']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

17276,Preparing the next generation of scientists in translation research.,"AIM: Four questions about translation research are considered in this article. (1) Why should there be concern about preparing nurse scientists for translation research? (2) Are current research-intensive doctoral programs in nursing preparing graduates for translation research? (3) Should targeted efforts be made to systematically prepare nurses in translation research? (4) What strategies would be useful? QUESTION 1: It is argued that translation research is needed in order to increase the odds that interventions found to be efficacious can be effectively translated into practices that will produce desired outcomes. Thus, evidence from translation research is a very important component of the science base needed to guide innovation in practice. Another reason of concern in preparing translation researchers is the growing pace of research into the efficacy of interventions, which accelerates the need for translation research. Furthermore, the emergence of clinical doctoral programs in nursing that will be seeking faculty with expertise in translation research supports the need for preparing scientists in translation research. QUESTION 2: To determine whether translation research was visible in current research-intensive doctoral programs, a Web-based review of these programs offered by colleges and universities in the database of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) was conducted in the fall of 2003. The search revealed that in the 79 programs surveyed, no school identified an area of emphasis in terms that suggested a component of translation science such as research dissemination or utilization, knowledge transfer, diffusion of innovation, or technology transfer. Less than a dozen courses could be located that focused on topics related to translation research or translation science. QUESTIONS 3 AND 4: The case is made that more attention should be given to preparing translation scientists in research-intensive doctoral programs in nursing, and several strategies were suggested for moving toward that goal.","['Curriculum', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Education, Nursing, Graduate', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Forecasting', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination', 'Internet', 'Nursing Research', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Program Evaluation', 'Research Personnel', 'Schools, Nursing', 'Societies, Nursing', 'United States']",17129339,"[['I02.158'], ['L01.143.320'], ['I02.358.337.450', 'I02.358.462.565'], ['H02.249.750', 'H02.403.200.400'], ['I01.320'], ['N03.349.380.420', 'N05.300.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.143.443'], ['L01.224.230.110.500'], ['H01.770.644.145.390', 'H02.478.395', 'N04.590.233.508.613'], ['N04.452.615'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['E05.337.820', 'N04.761.685', 'N05.715.360.650'], ['M01.526.839'], ['I02.783.495.623'], ['N03.540.828.672'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
3913,"Interactive effects of water limitation and elevated temperature on the physiology, development and fitness of diverse accessions of Brachypodium distachyon.","An enduring question in plant physiology and evolution is how single genotypes of plants optimize performance in diverse, often highly variable, environments. We grew 35 natural accessions of the grass Brachypodium distachyon in four environments in the glasshouse, contrasting soil water deficit, elevated temperature and their interaction. We modeled treatment, genotype and interactive effects on leaf-level and whole-plant traits, including fecundity. We also assessed the relationship between glasshouse-measured traits and parameters related to climate at the place of origin. We found abundant genetic variation in both constitutive and induced traits related to plant-water relations. Most traits showed strong interaction between temperature and water availability, and we observed genotype-by-environment interaction for several traits. Notably, leaf free proline abundance showed a strong effect of genotype ? temperature ? water. We found strong associations between phenology, biomass and water use efficiency (WUE) with parameters describing climate of origin. Plants respond to multiple stressors in ways not directly predictable from single stressors, underscoring the complex and trait-specific mechanisms of environmental response. Climate-trait correlations support a role for WUE and phenology in local adaptation to climate in B. distachyon.","['Biodiversity', 'Brachypodium', 'Climate', 'Genotype', 'Inheritance Patterns', 'Models, Biological', 'Quantitative Trait, Heritable', 'Soil', 'Temperature', 'Water']",27864966,"[['G16.500.275.157.049', 'N06.230.124.049'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.072'], ['G16.500.275.071', 'N06.230.300.100.250'], ['G05.380'], ['G05.420'], ['E05.599.395'], ['G05.420.720'], ['D20.721', 'G01.311.820', 'G16.500.275.815', 'N06.230.600'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
7851,Correlates of fatigue phenomenon in palliative care patients with advance cancers in Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a multidimensional phenomenon that has different meanings according to different societal and cultural settings. This study aims to decipher fatigue in Taiwanese patients with cancer.METHODS: We recruited 440 patients with advanced cancer admitted consecutively to the palliative care unit of a major medical center in Taiwan. The data were collected at admission, 1 and 2 weeks after admission, and 2 days before death.RESULTS: The subject group consisted of 51.8% males and 48.2% females with a median age of 67 years (ranging from 27 to 93 years). The leading primary tumor sites among these patients were lung (20.2%), liver (18.0%), and colon-rectum (10.7%), and the median survival was 15 days, with a range of 1 to 418 days. All symptoms improved 1 week after admission, but most of them significantly worsened 2 days before death. In general, the physical signs manifested variation patterns similar to those of symptoms. The severity of psychosocial distress and death fear was lower after admission and retained the same level at 2 days before death, defying the consistent patterns found in other symptoms and signs. In the correlation analysis, most symptoms were correlated with fatigue during admission, with weakness being the most significant one. Although self-efficacy and emotion were correlated with fatigue both on admission and 1 week after admission, social support and death fear were not correlated with fatigue at all times.CONCLUSION: The meaning of fatigue is mainly associated with physical factors among these patients. Education of complexities in fatigue in tandem with psychosocial and spiritual care may help alleviate this symptom, and promote quality of life.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms', 'Palliative Care', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Taiwan']",22612408,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C23.888.369'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04'], ['E02.760.666', 'N02.421.585.666'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['Z01.252.474.872', 'Z01.639.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
30431,Going flat: examining heterogeneity in the soda-obesity relationship by subgroup and place of birth among Asian Americans.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if the association between soda consumption and obesity is uniform among Asian-American population subgroups.DESIGN: We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses on odds of being obese among seven Asian subgroups and by place of birth using data from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey.SETTING: An omnibus population-based health survey.SUBJECTS: Non-institutionalized adults, aged 18 years or over, residing in California (n 36 271).RESULTS: Despite low levels of soda consumption in several Asian-American ethnic groups, soda consumption increased the odds of being obese among Chinese, Koreans and Other Asians but not for Whites. Obesity risk varied across Asian subgroups and by place of birth within these subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: More public health efforts addressing soda consumption in Asian-American communities are needed as a strategy for not only preventing chronic diseases but also disparities, considering the varying levels of soda intake across subgroups. Results support the growing body of literature critiquing acculturation theory in immigrant health research by documenting inconsistent findings by place of birth. Future research should take into account the heterogeneity among Asian Americans to advance our understanding of health outcomes and disparities.","['Acculturation', 'Adult', 'Asian Americans', 'California', 'Carbonated Beverages', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Emigrants and Immigrants', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity', 'Public Health', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",28233506,"[['I01.076.201.450.050', 'I01.880.853.100.079'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.686.508.200.100', 'M01.686.754.225'], ['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['G07.203.100.300', 'J02.200.300'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['M01.189'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['E05.318.308.980.438', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['H02.403.720', 'N01.400.550', 'N06.850'], ['N01.224.791', 'N06.850.505.400.800'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
30869,"Integration of leprosy elimination into primary health care in orissa, India.","BACKGROUND: Leprosy was eliminated as a public health problem (<1 case per 10,000) in India by December 2005. With this target in sight the need for a separate vertical programme was diminished. The second phase of the National Leprosy Eradication Programme was therefore initiated: decentralisation of the vertical programme, integration of leprosy services into the primary health care (PHC) system and development of a surveillance system to monitor programme performance.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To study the process of integration a qualitative analysis of issues and perceptions of patients and providers, and a review of leprosy records and registers to evaluate programme performance was carried out in the state of Orissa, India. Program performance indicators such as a low mean defaulter rate of 3.83% and a low-misdiagnosis rate of 4.45% demonstrated no detrimental effect of integration on program success. PHC staff were generally found to be highly knowledgeable of diagnosis and management of leprosy cases due to frequent training and a support network of leprosy experts. However in urban hospitals district-level leprosy experts had assumed leprosy activities. The aim was to aid busy PHC staff but it also compromised their leprosy knowledge and management capacity. Inadequate monitoring of a policy of 'new case validation,' in which MDT was not initiated until primary diagnosis had been verified by a leprosy expert, may have led to approximately 26% of suspect cases awaiting confirmation of diagnosis 1-8 months after their initial PHC visit.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the need for effective monitoring and evaluation of the integration process. Inadequate monitoring could lead to a reduction in early diagnosis, a delay in initiation of MDT and an increase in disability rates. This in turn could reverse some of the programme's achievements. These findings may help Andhra Pradesh and other states in India to improve their integration process and may also have implications for other disease elimination programmes such as polio and guinea worm (dracunculiasis) as they move closer to their elimination goals.","['Awareness', 'Counseling', 'Delivery of Health Care, Integrated', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Health Education', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leprosy', 'Patient Compliance', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility of Results']",20020051,"[['F02.463.188.150'], ['F02.784.176', 'F04.408.413', 'N02.421.143.303', 'N02.421.461.363'], ['N04.590.374.142', 'N05.300.262'], ['E02.319.310'], ['I02.233.332', 'N02.421.726.407'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.475.371'], ['F01.100.150.750.500.600', 'F01.145.488.887.500.600', 'N05.300.150.800.500.600'], ['N04.590.233.727'], ['N04.761', 'N05.715'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
12115,Somatic and psychological effects of low-dose aromatase inhibition in men with obesity-related hypogonadotropic hypotestosteronemia.,"INTRODUCTION: Reduced testosterone levels are frequently observed in obese men. Increased aromatase activity may be an etiological factor.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluate the clinical effects of aromatase inhibition in obesity-related hypogonadotropic hypotestosteronemia (OrHH).METHODS: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial in 42 obese men with a BMI >35 kg/m(2), and a serum total testosterone <10 nmol/l. All patients started on one tablet of 2.5 mg/week, with subsequent dose escalation every month until a serum total testosterone of 20 nmol/l was reached.ENDPOINTS: Psychological function, body composition, exercise capacity, and glucose, lipid, and bone metabolism.RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients completed the study according to protocol. Letrozole decreased serum estradiol from 119.1±10.1 to 59.2±6.1 pmol/l (P<0.001), and increased serum LH from 3.3±0.3 to 8.8±0.9 U/l (P<0.0001) and serum total testosterone from 8.6±0.7 to 21.5±1.3 nmol/l (P<0.0001). Significant effects on the predefined endpoints were not observed.CONCLUSION: Despite a marked rise in serum testosterone, low-dose aromatase inhibition had no somatic or psychological effects in men with OrHH.","['Adult', 'Androgens', 'Aromatase Inhibitors', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'Bone Density', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Energy Intake', 'Estradiol', 'Exercise Tolerance', 'Hormones', 'Humans', 'Hypogonadism', 'Letrozole', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Nitriles', 'Obesity, Morbid', 'Psychometrics', 'Testosterone', 'Triazoles']",23949882,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.696.399.472.161'], ['D27.505.519.389.870.300', 'D27.505.696.399.450.327.149', 'D27.505.696.399.450.855.300'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['G02.111.130', 'G03.180', 'G07.100.049'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['G11.427.100'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['G07.203.650.240.340'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['G11.427.680.270'], ['D06.472', 'D27.505.696.399.472'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C19.391.482'], ['D02.626.300', 'D03.383.129.799.638'], ['G03.458'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.463', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343.463', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343.463'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.711.513'], ['D02.626'], ['C18.654.726.500.700', 'C23.888.144.699.500.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500.500'], ['F04.711.780'], ['D04.210.500.054.079.429.824', 'D06.472.334.851.968.984'], ['D03.383.129.799']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

6155,The role of cytotoxic and regulatory T cells in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.,"Recent data suggests the presence of cytotoxic (TIA-1 and granzyme B+) and regulatory T-cells (FOXP3+) in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) tissues has been shown to correlate with poor overall survival in mainly diagnostic biopsies. By tissue microarray analyses, we extend this observation to a cohort of relapsed/refractory cHL tissue biopsies and analyze immunohistochemical expression of FOXP3, TIA-1, and granzyme B in the inflammatory background and the tumor microenvironment. High expression of TIA-1 (>50%) correlated with poor overall survival (P<0.0001), low expression of FOXP3 (<25%) correlated with poor overall survival (P<0.01), and combined high TIA-1 (>50%) and low FOXP3 (<25%) correlated with poor overall survival (P<0.0001).

33866,Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: differentiation of malignant and benign tumors by endoscopic ultrasound findings of mural nodules.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs)have a wide pathologic spectrum and it is difficult to differentiate malignant from benign tumors. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of malignancy using contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound (CE-EUS).SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In our institute, main duct type and mixed type IPMNs, branch duct type IPMNs with mural nodules, and IPMNs with coexistent invasive ductal cancer were indications for surgery. Eighty-seven IPMNs (14 main duct, 25 mixed, and 48 branch duct type) were resected and CE-EUS findings were compared with pathologic findings. Twelve clinicopathological variables and CE-EUS morphologic findings were assessed.Mural nodules defined as blood flow supplied protrusions were classified into 4 types: type I: low papillary nodule, type II: polypoid nodule, type III:papillary nodule, and type IV: invasive nodule.RESULTS: Forty-two, 26, 16, and 3 were pathologically diagnosed as adenoma,noninvasive carcinoma, invasive IPMNs, and coexistent invasive ductal cancer, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that types III/IV mural nodule (odds ratio = 10.8; 95% confidential intervals = 2.75-56.1) and symptomatic IPMNs (odds ratio = 4.31; 95% confidential intervals = 1.37-14.7) were significant for malignancy. For mural nodule diameter, invasive IPMNs were significantly larger, but types III and IV mural nodules were more frequently associated with malignancy, particularly invasive cancer, at 88.9% and 91.7%, respectively. The diagnosis of IPMNs with types III or IV mural nodule as malignant resulted in a sensitivity of 60%, specificity of 92.9%, and accuracy of 75.9%.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, new morphologic criteria were useful to identify the malignant potentials of IPMNs.","['Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Contrast Media', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Endosonography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Probability', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",19300203,"[['C04.557.470.200.025.075', 'C04.557.470.590.075'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.119.500', 'E01.370.225.998.054.119.500', 'E01.370.388.100.100.500', 'E04.074.119.500', 'E04.665.100.500', 'E05.200.500.384.100.119.500', 'E05.200.998.054.119.500', 'E05.242.384.100.119.500'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.232.750', 'C04.557.470.615.132.750', 'C04.588.274.761.750', 'C04.588.322.475.750', 'C06.301.761.750', 'C06.689.667.625', 'C19.344.421.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E05.318.740.275', 'N05.715.360.750.220', 'N06.850.520.830.275'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['E01.171'], ['E01.370.350.850.280'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['A10.615.550'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['C04.588.274.761', 'C04.588.322.475', 'C06.301.761', 'C06.689.667', 'C19.344.421'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
43927,[The effect of dexmedetomidine on autophagy and apoptosis in intestinal ischemia reperfusion-induced lung injury].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effects of dexmedetomidine against autophagy and apoptosis in intestinal ischemia reperfusion (I/R)-induced lung injury.METHODS: Twenty-four SD rats were randomly and equally divided into 4 groups according to the random number table: control group, I/R group, small dose of dexmedetomidine (D1) group and large dose of dexmedetomidine (D2) group. The model of lung injury was induced by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by 12 h reperfusion. Rats in D1 and D2 groups received intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine at dose of 1 µg/kg and 5 µg/kg respectively. Rats in control and I/R groups were given same volume of normal saline. Pathological changes were detected by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3(LC3)II/I ratio, Beclin-1, Bax and Bcl-2 expression were measured by Western blot. Cell apoptosis was assayed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), while caspase-3 activity was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Significant infiltration of neutrophils and thickened alveolar walls were observed in the I/R group compared to the control group, which were improved by dexmedetomidine (5 µg/kg) treatment. Compared to the control group, the apoptosis cells [(69 ± 8) cells/field], LC3 II/I ratio(57 ± 8), Beclin-1(487%± 45%) and Bax (358% ± 37%) expression were markedly increased (P<0.05), while Bcl-2 (39% ± 5%) expression was decreased (P<0.05) in the I/R group. Compared to the I/R group, the apoptosis cells [(32 ± 5) cells/field], LC3 II/I ratio(27 ± 4), Beclin-1 (285%± 41%) and Bax (181% ± 25%) expression were markedly reduced (P<0.05), while Bcl-2 (91% ± 9%) expression was increased (P<0.05) in the D2 group.CONCLUSIONS: Autophagy and apoptosis were activated in intestinal I/R-induced lung injury.

19086,Human neutrophils exhibit disparate chemotactic factor gene expression.,"The evolution of acute inflammation from initiation through resolution is associated with the changing character of the infiltrating leukocytes. Recruitment of these leukocytes is dependent upon the generation of chemotactic factors that have either global or specific activity for a particular leukocyte. In this manuscript we present data demonstrating that human neutrophils can express mRNA for neutrophil chemotactic factor/interleukin 8 (IL-8), but fail to express mRNA for monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1). The expression of IL-8 was observed upon adherence or in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Maximal IL-8 antigenic production was noted at 24 hrs. These studies demonstrate a disparate expression of chemotactic cytokines by neutrophils.","['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-8', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils', 'RNA, Messenger']",1701991,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.110.990.600', 'D12.776.467.374.200.110.990.600', 'D23.125.300.110.990.600', 'D23.469.200.110.990.600', 'D23.529.374.200.110.990.500'], ['D23.125'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['D23.050.550'], ['G05.297'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.470'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.120.800', 'D12.644.276.374.465.312', 'D12.776.467.374.200.120.800', 'D12.776.467.374.465.246', 'D23.125.300.120.800', 'D23.469.200.120.800', 'D23.529.374.200.120.800', 'D23.529.374.465.312'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['D13.444.735.544']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
21657,"Combination of herbal components (curcumin, carvacrol, thymol, cinnamaldehyde) in broiler chicken feed: Impacts on response parameters, performance, fatty acid profiles, meat quality and control of coccidia and bacteria.","The objective of this study was to determine whether curcumin and a commercial microencapsulated phytogenic supplement containing thymol, cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol in broiler chicken feed would improve health and meat quality (fatty acid profile), as well as to determine the coccidiostatic and bactericidal potential of the additives. The broiler chickens were divided into five groups: NC - negative control feed; PC - positive control; CU - with 50 mg/kg of curcumin, PHY - 100 mg/kg phytogenic; and PHY + CU, a combination of both additives at 50 mg/kg (curcumin) and 100 mg/kg (phytogenic). We observed significantly higher levels of total proteins associated with increased circulating globulins, as well as lower levels of uric acid, cholesterol and triglycerides in the PHY + CU group than in the NC. There were significantly fewer oocysts in birds supplemented with additives in the NC group on day 21; on day 35, the NC, PHY and PHY + CU groups had significantly lower counts than the PC and CU groups; however, at 44 days, the lowest counts were in PC group. The bacterial counts were significantly lower on day 21 in all groups that received additives than those of the control group; however, at 44 days, the bacterial and Escherichia coli counts in these groups were significantly higher than those of the control. Curcumin with or without phytogenic agent improved meat quality, with increased antioxidant levels and reduction of lipid peroxidation. There were significantly lower total saturated fatty acid levels and significantly greater monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty acid levels in broilers that consumed additives individually and in combination. The combination of additives significantly increased the crypt/villus ratio, a marker of improved intestinal health and performance. Additives potentiated their individual effects, suggesting they can replace conventional growth promoters without compromising health, intestinal mucosa or meat quality.","['Acrolein', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Chickens', 'Coccidia', 'Coccidiosis', 'Curcumin', 'Cymenes', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Fatty Acids', 'Meat', 'Poultry Diseases', 'Thymol']",31812772,"[['D02.047.122'], ['G07.203.300.300.100', 'J02.500.300.100'], ['B01.050'], ['B03'], ['C01.150.252'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['B01.043.075.189'], ['C01.610.752.250'], ['D02.455.326.146.485.222.222', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.200', 'D02.455.426.559.694.222'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.310', 'D02.455.849.575.219'], ['G07.203.300.456', 'J02.500.456'], ['D10.251'], ['G07.203.300.600', 'J02.500.600'], ['C22.131.728'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.963', 'D02.455.849.575.875']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
17794,"Neurologic Outcomes After Low-Volume, Ultrasound-Guided Interscalene Block and Ambulatory Shoulder Surgery.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postoperative neurologic symptoms after interscalene block and shoulder surgery have been reported to be relatively frequent. Reports of such symptoms after ultrasound-guided block have been variable. We evaluated 300 patients for neurologic symptoms after low-volume, ultrasound-guided interscalene block and arthroscopic shoulder surgery.METHODS: Patients underwent ultrasound-guided interscalene block with 16 to 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine or a mix of 0.2% bupivacaine/1.2% mepivacaine solution, followed by propofol/ketamine sedation for ambulatory arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Patients were called at 10 days for evaluation of neurologic symptoms, and those with persistent symptoms were called again at 30 days, at which point neurologic evaluation was initiated. Details of patient demographics and block characteristics were collected to assess any association with persistent neurologic symptoms.RESULTS: Six of 300 patients reported symptoms at 10 days (2%), with one of these patients having persistent symptoms at 30 days (0.3%). This was significantly lower than rates of neurologic symptoms reported in preultrasound investigations with focused neurologic follow-up and similar to other studies performed in the ultrasound era. There was a modest correlation between the number of needle redirections during the block procedure and the presence of postoperative neurologic symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound guidance of interscalene block with 16- to 20-mL volumes of local anesthetic solution results in a lower frequency of postoperative neurologic symptoms at 10 and 30 days as compared with investigations in the preultrasound period.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ambulatory Surgical Procedures', 'Anesthetics, Combined', 'Anesthetics, Local', 'Arthroscopy', 'Bupivacaine', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mepivacaine', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Prospective Studies', 'Shoulder', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional']",27281729,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E04.030'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.017', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.017'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['E01.370.388.250.070', 'E04.502.250.070', 'E04.555.113'], ['D02.065.199.239', 'D02.092.146.113.239'], ['E05.723.402'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.383.621.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E03.155.086.711', 'E04.525.210.550'], ['E01.370.376.550', 'E01.370.600.550'], ['C10.668.829'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['A01.378.800.750'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.350.850.855', 'E04.502.890']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
32826,Reducing conduct problems among children exposed to intimate partner violence: a randomized clinical trial examining effects of Project Support.,"This study was a randomized clinical trial of Project Support, an intervention designed to reduce conduct problems among children exposed to intimate partner violence. Participants were 66 families (mothers and children) with at least 1 child exhibiting clinical levels of conduct problems. Families were recruited from domestic violence shelters. The Project Support intervention involves (a) teaching mothers child management skills and (b) providing instrumental and emotional support to mothers. Families were randomly assigned to the Project Support intervention condition or to an existing services comparison condition. They were assessed on 6 occasions over 20 months, following their departure from the shelter. Children in families in the Project Support condition, compared with those in the comparison condition, exhibited greater reductions in conduct problems. Mothers in the Project Support condition, compared with those in the comparison condition, displayed greater reductions in inconsistent and harsh parenting behaviors and psychiatric symptoms. Changes in mothers' parenting and psychiatric symptoms accounted for a sizable proportion of Project Support's effects on child conduct problems at the end of treatment. Clinical and policy implications are discussed.","['Adult', 'Child', 'Child of Impaired Parents', 'Child, Preschool', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Education', 'Family Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Parenting', 'Social Support', 'Spouse Abuse', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Young Adult']",19634963,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.106'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['F03.625.094.300'], ['I02'], ['F04.754.864.581.273'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.263.370.290.170'], ['F01.829.263.370.310'], ['I01.880.853.500.600'], ['I01.198.240.856.350.750', 'I01.198.240.856.575.500', 'I01.880.735.900.350.750', 'I01.880.735.900.688.500'], ['F03.950.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
41729,Chromosome 1q loss of heterozygosity frequently occurs in sporadic insulinomas and is associated with tumor malignancy.,"The pathogenesis of sporadic insulinomas is not clear, and there are no reliable genetic determinants that are useful to distinguish malignant and benign forms of this tumor. It was reported that 1q LOH might contribute to pathogenesis in gastrinomas and was correlated with tumor progression. However, little data are available on 1q LOH in sporadic insulinomas. In our study, we determine whether 1q LOH occurs in sporadic insulinomas and is associated with tumor malignancy by performing 1q allelotyping with 17 markers in 40 tumors and pair normal DNA. Thirty-five (88%) insulinomas had 1q LOH. Of the 35 insulinomas with 1q LOH, 14 (40%) had 1q21.3-23.2 LOH over a 7.5 cM region (SRO-1), whereas LOH in 21 tumors (60%) occurred at 1q31.3 over an 11.4 cM area (SRO-2). Of 24 tumors without MEN1 LOH, 20 had either SRO-1 or SRO-2 LOH (83%), whereas in 16 tumors with MEN1 LOH, 9 were shown to have LOH at either SRO-1 or SRO-2 (56%) (p = 0.065). This result suggests that LOH at 2 SRO might be MEN1 gene independent and may contribute to the pathogenesis in a subset of insulinomas without MEN1 gene LOH. The presence of 1q21.3-23.2 LOH is significantly associated with malignancy of insulinomas (p = 0.014). The high frequency of LOH at 1q 21.3-23.2 and 1q31.3 suggests these 2 areas may harbor putative tumor suppressor genes that may play an important role in the tumorigenesis of a subset of insulinomas. LOH at 1q21.3-23.2, which was associated with tumor malignancy, could be one of the genetic markers for identifying malignancy in sporadic insulinomas.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Insulinoma', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms']",15900598,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.393.183'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.235.240', 'G05.360.162.520.300.235.240'], ['D13.444.308.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['C04.557.470.035.100.852', 'C04.588.274.761.249.500', 'C04.588.322.475.249.500', 'C06.301.761.249.500', 'C06.689.667.249.500', 'C19.344.421.249.500'], ['G05.365.590.029.530'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.340.024.850.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.588.274.761', 'C04.588.322.475', 'C06.301.761', 'C06.689.667', 'C19.344.421']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
10625,Health-related and condition-specific quality of life in episodic cluster headache.,"Health-related quality of life was studied in 35 episodic cluster headache (CH) patients during and after the cluster period, using a generic (SF-36) and a headache-specific (MSQ2.1) instrument. The results were compared with those of age- and sex-matched migraineurs (n = 53) and healthy persons (n = 62). During the cluster period patients had lower scores than controls in all SF-36 and MSQ2.1 domains. The difference was significant for most SF-36 and all MSQ2.1 domains. Although CH patients had lower scores than migraineurs on most scales, the difference was significant only on SF-36 scores measuring bodily pain and social functioning. There was a good correlation between the two instruments. After the termination of the cluster period the quality of life of patients was similar to that of headache-free controls. Generic and headache-specific QoL are severely impaired in CH and this impairment is at least as severe as in migraine.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Cluster Headache', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",15009012,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['C10.228.140.546.399.937.500'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['E05.318.308.980.438', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

The factors that determine the selectivity of the disease process remain unknown. We had speculated that PPA may occasionally arise as a tardive manifestation of genetic or acquired vulnerabilities involving the language network of the brain.OBJECTIVE: To explore predisposing factors for PPA.RESULTS: In 2 patients, PPA developed with a background of mild left hemicranial hypoplasia.CONCLUSION: In keeping with other observations of PPA in patients with dyslexia and childhood injury to the left temporal lobe, these 2 patients support the contention that some cases of PPA may arise in settings where the language network has become a locus of least resistance.","['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Aphasia, Primary Progressive', 'Apolipoproteins E', 'Brain', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cranial Fossa, Middle', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Female', 'Functional Laterality', 'Humans', 'Language', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",14967776,"[['E02.760.169.063.500.067', 'E02.831.067', 'I03.050', 'N02.421.784.110'], ['M01.060.116'], ['C10.228.140.380.132', 'C10.597.606.150.500.800.100.155', 'C23.888.592.604.150.500.800.100.155', 'F03.615.400.125'], ['D10.532.091.500', 'D12.776.070.400.500', 'D12.776.521.120.500'], ['A08.186.211'], ['F03.615.250'], ['A01.456.830.165', 'A02.835.232.781.750.165'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['C10.228.140.490'], ['F02.830.297.425', 'G11.561.225.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.209.399', 'L01.559'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.737'], ['E01.370.350.350.800.800', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800.800', 'E01.370.350.710.800.800', 'E01.370.350.825.800.800', 'E01.370.384.730.800.800'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
26639,"Delayed enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance and clinical, morphological, and electrocardiographical features in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","BACKGROUND: The clinical, morphological, and electrocardiographical relevance of delayed enhancement (DE) in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was studied in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 56 patients underwent both gadolinium-enhanced CMR and 12-lead electrocardiogram. The CMR demonstrated DE at the left ventricular (LV) wall in 39 patients. The patients with DE included more cases with dilated phase of HCM, higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes and incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT), lower LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and mean LV wall thickness (WT), and a larger ratio of maximum to minimum LVWT. The QRS duration was prolonged and the QRS axis deviated toward left with increases in the DE volume (r = 0.58 and r = 0.41, P < .01). Abnormal Q waves were present in 5 patients and the location coincided with the DE segments in 4 patients, but the concordance was not significant. The amplitude of T waves correlated with the ratio of the apex to basal LVWT (r = 0.38, P < .01) and was more negative in cases with DE at the apex.CONCLUSIONS: In HCM, the DE was associated with higher NYHA classes and prevalence of VT, impaired global LV function and asymmetrical hypertrophy, and conduction disturbance, abnormal Q waves, and giant negative T waves.","['Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",19477402,"[['C14.280.238.100', 'C14.280.484.048.750.070.160'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['A07.541.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.600.350', 'L01.224.308.380'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['G09.330.955.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
29437,The relation between supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction.,"The clinical characteristics of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTA) and their relation to left ventricular dysfunction were assessed in 208 consecutive patients with recent myocardial infarction. Arrhythmias were quantified on hospital discharge by 24 hour electrocardiographic recording. All the variables were evaluated between the second and the fourth week after infarction. SVTA occurred in 113 (54%) patients: Supraventricular premature beats (SVPB) in 49 (24%), frequent or repetitive SVPB in 37 (18%), atrial or junctional tachycardia in 23 (11%), atrial flutter or fibrillation in 4 (2%). Most of these arrhythmias occurred in the absence of symptoms, and the most complex forms were always selflimiting. No relation was found among the presence of different forms of SVTA and sex, coronary risk factors, previous history of ischemic heart disease, type or site of acute myocardial infarction, NYHA functional class. Age, left atrial dimension (LAD), cardio-thoracic ratio (CTR) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest differed significantly among three groups of patients: those without SVTA, those with SVPB less than 100 per hour and those with frequent-repetitive SVPB or atrial-junctional tachycardia. The more SVTA complexity, the worse LAD, CTR, LVEF and the higher the age. Multivariate discriminant analysis showed that CTR was directly and LVEF inversely related to the occurrence of SVPB less than 100 per hour, while the presence of frequent-repetitive SVPB or supraventricular tachycardia was closely related to increasing age, LAD, CTR and decreasing LVEF. Patients with atrial fibrillation always showed the worst values of LAD, CTR, LVEF and age. The results of the present study show that different types of SVTA occurring at discharge from hospital after myocardial infarction are clinically benign, but always suggestive of different degrees of left ventricular dysfunction.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Atrial Flutter', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Failure', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Risk Factors', 'Tachycardia, Ectopic Atrial', 'Tachycardia, Ectopic Junctional', 'Tachycardia, Supraventricular']",3266415,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C14.280.067.198', 'C23.550.073.198'], ['C14.280.067.248', 'C23.550.073.248'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C14.280.434'], ['A07.541.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.520'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C14.280.067.845.880.315', 'C14.280.123.875.880.315', 'C23.550.073.845.880.315'], ['C14.280.067.845.880.320', 'C14.280.123.875.880.320', 'C23.550.073.845.880.320'], ['C14.280.067.845.880', 'C14.280.123.875.880', 'C23.550.073.845.880']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
29192,Regulation of ApoB secretion by the low density lipoprotein receptor requires exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and interaction with ApoE or ApoB.,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is required for the hepatic assembly and secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The LDL receptor (LDLR) promotes post-translational degradation of apoB and thereby reduces VLDL particle secretion. We investigated the trafficking pathways and ligand requirements for the LDLR to promote degradation of apoB. We first tested whether the LDLR drives apoB degradation in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated pathway. Primary mouse hepatocytes harboring an ethyl-nitrosourea-induced, ER-retained mutant LDLR secreted comparable levels of apoB with LDLR-null hepatocytes, despite reduced secretion from cells expressing the wild-type LDLR. Additionally, treatment of cells with brefeldin A inhibited LDLR-dependent degradation. However, this rescue was reversible, and degradation of apoB occurred upon removal of brefeldin A. To characterize the lipoprotein reuptake pathway of degradation, we employed an LDLR mutant defective in constitutive endocytosis and internalization of apoB. This mutant was as effective in reducing apoB secretion as the wild-type LDLR. However, the effect was dependent on apolipoprotein E (apoE) as only the wild-type LDLR, and not the endocytic mutant, reduced apoB secretion in apoE-null cells. Treatment with heparin rescued a pool of apoB in cells expressing the endocytic mutant, indicating that reuptake of VLDL via apoE still occurs with this mutant. Finally, an LDLR mutant defective in binding apoB but not apoE reduced apoB secretion in an apoE-dependent manner. Together, these data suggest that the LDLR directs apoB to degradation in a post-ER compartment. Furthermore, the reuptake mechanism of degradation occurs via internalization of apoB through a constitutive endocytic pathway and apoE through a ligand-dependent pathway.","['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', 'Apolipoproteins B', 'Apolipoproteins E', 'Brefeldin A', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepatocytes', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, LDL']",18272520,"[['B04.280.030'], ['B01.050'], ['D10.532.091.300', 'D12.776.070.400.300', 'D12.776.521.120.300'], ['D10.532.091.500', 'D12.776.070.400.500', 'D12.776.521.120.500'], ['D02.540.576.500.875'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.248'], ['G05.308'], ['A11.436.348'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['E05.599.395'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D12.776.543.750.710.450']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
10230,A cost-effectiveness analysis of the diagnostic strategies for differentiating focal nodular hyperplasia from hepatocellular adenoma.,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI) strategy compared with conventional MRI strategy and biopsy to differentiate focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) from hepatocellular adenoma (HCA).METHODS: A decision tree model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of EOB-MRI, conventional MRI with extracellular contrast agents, and biopsy as the initial diagnostic modality in patients with incidentally detected focal liver lesions suspected of being FNH or HCA. We analysed the cost and effectiveness, i.e. probability of successful diagnosis of each strategy. Costs were based on utilisation rates and Medicare reimbursements in the USA and South Korea.RESULTS: In the base case analysis of our decision tree model, the effectiveness of the three strategies was similar. The cost of the EOB-MRI strategy ($1283 in USA, $813 in South Korea) was lowest compared with the biopsy strategy ($1725 in USA, $847 in South Korea) and the conventional MRI strategy ($1750 in USA, $962 in South Korea). One-way, two-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed unchanged results over an acceptable range.CONCLUSIONS: EOB-MRI strategy is the most cost-effective strategy for differentiating FNH from HCA in patients with incidentally detected focal liver lesions in a non-cirrhotic liver.KEY POINTS: • The effectiveness of the three strategies was similar. • The cost of the EOB-MRI strategy was lowest. • EOB-MRI strategy is the most cost-effective for differentiating FNH from HCA.","['Adenoma, Liver Cell', 'Adult', 'Contrast Media', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Focal Nodular Hyperplasia', 'Gadolinium DTPA', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement', 'Liver', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'Middle Aged', 'Republic of Korea', 'United States']",28726119,"[['C04.557.470.035.120', 'C04.588.274.623.040', 'C06.301.623.040', 'C06.552.697.040'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['N03.219.151.125'], ['G17.162.500'], ['E01.171'], ['C06.552.270'], ['D02.092.782.590.401', 'D02.241.081.018.639.400', 'D02.257.141'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.600.350', 'L01.224.308.380'], ['A03.620'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['N03.219.521.346.506.564.663', 'N03.219.521.576.343.840', 'N03.706.615.696'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.252.474.557.750'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
7857,Bioinformatics Assembling and Assessment of Novel Coxsackievirus B1 Genome.,"The human microbiome project via application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing techniques has found surprising large and diverse amounts of microbial sequences across different body sites. There is a wave of investigators studying autoimmune related diseases designing from birth case and control studies to elucidate microbial associations and potential direct triggers. Sequencing analysis, considered big data as it typically includes millions of reads, is challenging but particularly demanding and complex is virome profiling due to its lack of pan-viral genomic signature. Impressively thousands of virus complete genomes have been deposited and these high-quality references are core components of virus profiling pipelines and databases. Still it is commonly known that most viral sequences do not map to known viruses. Moreover human viruses, particularly RNA groups, are notoriously heterogeneous due to high mutation rates. Here, we present the related assembling challenges and a series of bioinformatics steps that were applied in the construction of the complete consensus genome of a novel clinical isolate of Coxsackievirus B1. We further demonstrate our effort in calling mutations between prototype Coxsackievirus B1 sequence from GenBank and serial clinical isolate genome grown in cell culture.","['Computational Biology', 'Enterovirus B, Human', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Metagenome', 'Metagenomics', 'Quality Control']",30129002,"[['H01.158.273.180', 'L01.313.124'], ['B04.820.578.750.284.182'], ['G05.360.340.358.840'], ['H01.158.273.180.350', 'H01.158.273.343.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G05.360.340.550'], ['H01.158.273.343.350.261'], ['J01.897.608']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Forty-two percent to 98% of CIS cells revealed an aneuploid pattern of nuclear DNA, indicating that most of them are neoplastic cells. In patients with hypospadias, CIS was not seen, and no other abnormalities were detected. In children with DMP, the percentage of tubules populated with germ cells was significantly lower than it was in those with hypospadias (48.3% +/- 10.6% vs 92.4% +/- 4.0%). The total number of germ cells (CIS cells + spermatogonia) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, but the number of spermatogonia was significantly reduced in children with DMP (0.08 +/- 0.05 vs 3.65 +/- 0.2), suggesting impaired differentiation of gonocytes to spermatogonia. The following significant correlations were present with DMP: 1) the higher the seminiferous tubule cross-section area, the higher the number of CIS cells (r = 0.78); and 2) the higher the serum gonadotropin levels, the higher were tubular diameter (r = 0.93 for FSH and r = 0.75 for luteinizing hormone [LH]), area (r = 0.79 for FSH and r = 0.82 for LH), percentage of tubules populated with germ cells (r = 0.86 for FSH and r = 0.81 for LH), and number of CIS cells (r = 0.87 for FSH and r = 0.79 for LH). The results indicate that in intersex children with 46,XY karyotype, CIS occurs in dysgenetic testes in all cases and is frequently associated with gonadoblastoma. Impaired organogenesis of sex cords, relative inhibition of testosterone secretion, and the associated increased secretion of gonadotropins may create a milieu that induces or is favorable for the formation or maintenance of neoplastic lesions in dysgenetic testes early in childhood.","['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disorders of Sex Development', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Male', 'Testicular Neoplasms', 'Testis']",11545290,"[['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C12.706.316', 'C13.351.875.253', 'C16.131.939.316', 'C19.391.119'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.288', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343.288', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343.288'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E01.370.225.500.385.315', 'E05.200.500.385.315', 'E05.242.385.315', 'E05.393.285.475'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.463', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343.463', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343.463'], ['C04.588.322.762', 'C04.588.945.440.915', 'C12.294.260.937', 'C12.758.409.937', 'C19.344.762', 'C19.391.829.782'], ['A05.360.444.849', 'A05.360.576.782', 'A06.300.312.782']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
13221,Bilingual medical students as interpreters--what are the benefits and risks?,"AIMS: To identify the frequency of medical students interpreting in healthcare settings and to explore the issues related to the use of non-professional interpreters.METHODS: All 4th and 5th year University of Otago medical students were surveyed to identify bilingual medical students who have interpreted for patients. Students and key informants were interviewed and audiotaped.RESULTS: Of the 102 bilingual students identified, 59 interpreted for patients. We analysed 39 student interviews. Most reported a 'good' interpreting experience and thought student interpreting was 'a good idea', but some encountered 'bad' experiences. Stakeholders (professional interpreters, DHB policy staff, and clinicians who use interpreters) thought students should not interpret. Issues explored were: student comfort, clinician's choice, the interpreter's role, cultural competency, awareness, and provision of interpreting services.CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of bilingual clinical medical students have interpreted for patients contrary to Capital and Coast District Health Board policy and professional interpreter recommendations. In conjunction with published literature and after consulting with interpreter trainers, we have developed a document which canvasses the issues involved and proposed practical guidelines, to better prepare healthcare professionals and non-professional interpreters for interpreting situations. More research is required to find out why clinicians are asking medical students and others to interpret rather than engaging professional interpreters.","['Communication Barriers', 'Humans', 'Multilingualism', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Risk Assessment', 'Students, Medical', 'Translating']",18815600,"[['L01.143.230'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.559.423.452'], ['F01.829.401.650.675', 'N05.300.660.625'], ['N04.761', 'N05.715'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['M01.848.769.602'], ['L01.559.423.796']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
34785,Phylogenomics of phosphoinositide lipid kinases: perspectives on the evolution of second messenger signaling and drug discovery.,"BACKGROUND: Phosphoinositide lipid kinases (PIKs) generate specific phosphorylated variants of phosatidylinositols (PtdIns) that are critical for second messenger signaling and cellular membrane remodeling. Mammals have 19 PIK isoforms spread across three major families: the PtIns 3-kinases (PI3Ks), PtdIns 4-kinases (PI4Ks), and PtdIns-P (PIP) kinases (PIPKs). Other eukaryotes have fewer yet varying PIK complements. PIKs are also an important, emerging class of drug targets for many therapeutic areas including cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases and host-pathogen interactions. Here, we report the genomic occurrences and evolutionary relationships or phylogenomics of all three PIK families across major eukaryotic groups and suggest potential ramifications for drug discovery.RESULTS: Our analyses reveal four core eukaryotic PIKs which are type III PIK4A and PIK4B, and at least one homolog each from PI3K (possibly PIK3C3 as the ancestor) and PIP5K families. We also applied evolutionary analyses to PIK disease ontology and drug discovery. Mutated PIK3CA are known to be oncogenic and several inhibitors are in anti-cancer clinical trials. We found conservation of activating mutations of PIK3CA in paralogous isoforms suggesting specific functional constraints on these residues. By mapping published compound inhibition data (IC50s) onto a phylogeny of PI3Ks, type II PI4Ks and distantly related, MTOR, ATM, ATR and PRKDC kinases, we also show that compound polypharmacology corresponds to kinase evolutionary relationships. Finally, we extended the rationale for drugs targeting PIKs of malarial Plasmodium falciparum, and the parasites, Leishmania sp. and Trypanosoma sp. by identifying those PIKs highly divergent from human homologs.CONCLUSION: Our phylogenomic analysis of PIKs provides new insights into the evolution of second messenger signaling. We postulate two waves of PIK diversification, the first in metazoans with a subsequent expansion in cold-blooded vertebrates that was post-emergence of Deutrostomia\Chordata but prior to the appearance of mammals. Reconstruction of the evolutionary relationships among these lipid kinases also adds to our understanding of their roles in various diseases and assists in their development as potential drug targets.","['1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase', 'Animals', 'Drug Discovery', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Phylogeny', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Signal Transduction']",21208444,"[['D08.811.913.696.620.550'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.295', 'H01.158.703.007.675', 'H01.181.466.675'], ['B01'], ['G05.045.250', 'G16.075.250'], ['H01.158.273.180.350', 'H01.158.273.343.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.645'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['G02.111.820.800', 'G04.835.800'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

44261,Evaluation of a dithiocarbamate derivative as a model of thiol oxidative stress in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes.,"Thiol redox state (TRS) refers to the balance between reduced thiols and their corresponding disulfides and is mainly reflected by the ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG). A decrease in GSH/GSSG, which reflects a state of thiol oxidative stress, as well as thiol modifications such as S-glutathionylation, has been shown to have important implications in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, research models for inducing thiol oxidative stress are important tools for studying the pathophysiology of these disease states as well as examining the impact of pharmacological interventions on thiol pathways. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of a dithiocarbamate derivative, 2-acetylamino-3-[4-(2-acetylamino-2-carboxyethylsulfanylthiocarbonylamino)phenylthiocarbamoylsulfanyl]propionic acid (2-AAPA), as a pharmacological model of thiol oxidative stress by examining the extent of thiol modifications induced in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes and its impact on cellular functions. The extent of thiol oxidative stress produced by 2-AAPA was also compared to other models of oxidative stress including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), diamide, buthionine sulfoximine, and N,N?-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitroso-urea. Results indicated that 2-AAPA effectively inhibited glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase activities and decreased the GSH/GSSG ratio by causing a significant accumulation of GSSG. 2-AAPA also increased the formation of protein disulfides as well as S-glutathionylation. The alteration in TRS led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and increase in reactive oxygen species production. Compared to other models, 2-AAPA is more potent at creating a state of thiol oxidative stress with lower cytotoxicity, higher specificity, and more pharmacological relevance, and could be utilized as a research tool to study TRS-related normal and abnormal biochemical processes in cardiovascular diseases.","['Acetylcysteine', 'Animals', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Glutathione', 'Glutathione Disulfide', 'Humans', 'Myocytes, Cardiac', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Rats', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds', 'Thiocarbamates']",24607690,"[['D02.886.030.230.259', 'D12.125.166.230.259'], ['B01.050'], ['C14'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D12.644.456.448'], ['D12.644.456.448.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A07.541.704.570', 'A10.690.552.750.570', 'A11.620.500'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D02.886.489'], ['D02.241.081.251.869', 'D02.886.706']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5408,"A phase II multicentered, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial of the stroke self-management program.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The benefits of chronic disease self-management programs for stroke survivors are uncertain because individuals with severe impairments have been excluded from previous research. We undertook a phase II randomized controlled trial to determine whether a self-management program designed for survivors (SSMP; 8 weeks) was safe and feasible compared to standard care (control) or a generic self-management program (generic; 6 weeks).METHODS: Stroke survivors were recruited from 7 South Australian hospitals via a letter or indirectly (eg, newspapers). Eligible participants were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio of 50 per group. Primary outcomes were recruitment, participation, and participant safety. Secondary outcomes were positive and active engagement in life using the Health Education Impact Questionnaire and characteristics of quality of life and mood at 6 months from program completion.RESULTS: Of 315 people screened, 149 were eligible and 143 were randomized (48 SSMP, 47 generic, 48 control); mean age was 69 years (SD, 11) and 59% were female. Demographic features were similar between groups and 41% had severe cognitive impairment; 57% accessed the interventions, with 52% SSMP and 38% generic completing >50% of sessions (P=0.18). Thirty-two participants reported adverse events (7 control, 12 generic, 13 SSMP; P=0.3; 34% severe); however, none was attributable to the interventions. Potential benefits for improved mood were found.CONCLUSIONS: SSMP was safe and feasible. Benefits of the stroke-specific program over the generic program included greater participation and completion rates. An efficacy trial is warranted given the forecast growth in the stroke population and improved survival trends.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Australia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Self Care', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Standard of Care', 'Stroke Rehabilitation', 'Treatment Outcome']",21493910,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['Z01.639.100', 'Z01.678.100.373'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E02.900', 'I03.050.563', 'N02.421.784.680'], ['E05.318.370.850', 'N05.715.360.325.730', 'N06.850.520.445.850'], ['N04.761.789.900', 'N05.715.840'], ['E02.760.169.063.500.477.500', 'E02.831.477.500', 'H02.403.680.600.750.500', 'N02.421.784.511.500'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
24486,Arecoline arrests cells at prometaphase by deregulating mitotic spindle assembly and spindle assembly checkpoint: implication for carcinogenesis.,"One apparent feature of cancerous cells is genomic instability, which may include various types of chromosomal aberrations, such as translocation, aneuploidy, and the presence of micronuclei inside the cells. Mutagenic factors that promote the emergence of genomic instability are recognized as risk factors for the development of human malignancies. In Asia, betel quid (BQ) chewing is one of such risk factors for oral cancer. Areca nut is an essential constitute of BQ and is declared as a group I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms regarding the carcinogenicity of areca nut are not fully explored. Here we reported that arecoline, a major alkaloid of areca nut, could arrest cells at prometaphase with large amounts of misaligned chromosomes. This prometaphase arrest was evidenced by condensed chromosome pattern, increased histone H3 phosphorylation, and accumulation of mitotic proteins, including aurora A and cyclin B(1). To investigate the molecular mechanisms accounting for arecoline-induced prometaphase arrest, we found that arecoline could stabilize mitotic spindle assembly, which led to distorted organization of mitotic spindles, misalignment of chromosomes, and up-regulation of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) genes. The SAC proteins BubR1 and Mps1 were differentially modified between the cells treated with arecoline and nocodazole. This together with aurora A overexpression suggested that SAC might be partly suppressed by arecoline. As a result, the arecoline-exposed cells might produce progeny that contained various chromosomal aberrations and exhibited genomic instability.","['Areca', 'Arecoline', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genomic Instability', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Mitosis', 'Mouth Neoplasms', 'Prometaphase', 'Spindle Apparatus', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",20138568,"[['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.093.088'], ['D03.066.515.292', 'D03.132.080', 'D03.383.725.547.292'], ['D27.888.569.100'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['C04.697.098.500', 'C23.550.727.098.500'], ['A11.251'], ['C23.550.362', 'G05.365.590.335', 'G05.370'], ['D12.776.157.687.485', 'D12.776.660.720.485', 'D12.776.664.469'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G04.144.220.220.781', 'G05.113.220.781'], ['C04.588.443.591', 'C07.465.530'], ['G04.144.220.220.687.812', 'G04.144.220.220.781.812', 'G05.113.220.687.812', 'G05.113.220.781.812'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750.820'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1609,Demonstration that orf2 encodes the feline immunodeficiency virus transactivating (Tat) protein and characterization of a unique gene product with partial rev activity.,"The long PCR technique was used to amplify the three size classes of viral mRNAs produced in cells infected by feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). We identified in the env region a new splice acceptor site that generated two transcripts, each coding for an 11-kDa protein, p11(rev), whose function is unknown. The small-size class of mRNAs included two bicistronic orf2/rev mRNAs and two rev-like mRNAs, consisting only of the second exon of rev and coding for a 15-kDa protein, p15(rev). p15(rev) contained the minimal effector domain of Rev and was sufficient to mediate partial Rev activity. The bicistronic mRNAs encoded two distinct proteins, one of 23 kDa corresponding to Rev and a 9-kDa protein encoded by the orf2 gene. The orf2 gene product is a protein of 79 amino acids with characteristics similar to those of the Tat (transactivator) proteins of the ungulate lentiviruses. Transient expression assays, using the FIV long terminal repeat (LTR) to drive transcription of the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase demonstrated that the orf2 gene transactivates gene expression an average of 14- to 20-fold above the basal level. Deletion mutants of the FIV LTR were generated to locate sequences responsive to transactivation mediated by the orf2 gene. A 5' deletion mutant that removed the AP1 site resulted in residual low-level transactivation by orf2. Further experiments using LTR mutants with internal deletions identified three regions located between positions -126 and -47 relative to the cap site that were important for orf2-directed transactivation. These regions include the AP1 site, a C/EBP tandem repeat, and an ATF site.","['Animals', 'Gene Products, rev', 'Gene Products, tat', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rabbits', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Activation']",9847366,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.157.725.076', 'D12.776.664.962.186', 'D12.776.964.925.984.385'], ['D12.776.260.755.199', 'D12.776.930.900.199', 'D12.776.964.900.750.750', 'D12.776.964.925.984.400'], ['B04.820.650.589.530.400'], ['G05.360.335.760.640', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.650'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.850', 'G05.360.080.708.850'], ['D12.776.260.755', 'D12.776.930.900', 'D12.776.964.925.984'], ['G05.308.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
35733,Use of guanidine hydrochloride and ammonium sulfate in comprehensive in-line sorption enrichment of xenobiotics in biological fluids by high-performance liquid chromatography.,"A novel approach has been developed for direct injection of physiological fluids on an in-line extraction pre-column followed by column switching in order to introduce the adsorbed xenobiotic onto the analytical column. The physiological fluid is pre-treated with guanidinium solution in water (200 microliters of fluid plus 300 microliters of a reagent containing 8.05 M guanidinium and 1.02 M ammonium sulfate) in order to denature protein binding sites and to serve as a universal solvent for a divergent range of polar to non-polar xenobiotics in a hydrophilic medium. A 0.5 M ammonium sulfate solution (500 microliters) is used as a pre- and post-flush reagent for the extraction pre-column (30 mm x 2.1 mm I.D.). The pre-flush reagent prepares the sorbent environment of the C18 pre-column for the hydrophobic retention of analytes. The post-flush reagent flushes non-retained sample proteins and salts to waste prior to switching the pre-column in-line with the analytical column. Universal chromatographic conditions for the analytical phase allows elution of a range of polar to non-polar xenobiotics within 20 min from an end-capped C8 silica analytical column (250 mm x 4.6 mm I.D.). This is effected by a linear gradient from a binary system consisting of solvent A (0.05 M KH2PO4) and solvent B (acetonitrile-isopropanol, 80:20, v/v).","['Ammonium Sulfate', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Guanidine', 'Guanidines', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Organophosphate Poisoning', 'Solvents', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Xenobiotics']",8468376,"[['D01.625.062.374', 'D01.875.800.800.850.050'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D02.078.370.472'], ['D02.078.370'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.720.470.410'], ['C25.723.717'], ['D27.720.844'], ['E05.196.712.726.802', 'E05.196.867.826.802'], ['D26.969']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
21550,A cost-effectiveness analysis of amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling for prenatal genetic testing.,"Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are tests for the prenatal diagnosis of cytogenetic abnormalities. We calculated the incremental costs per abnormal birth averted, and the incremental costs per quality-adjusted outcome, of amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling performed for the indication of maternal age. Probabilities were obtained from the literature, and direct medical costs from hospital charges deflated to reflect aggregated contracted care reimbursements. Utilities were used to quality-adjust prenatal testing outcomes. Based on costs per abnormal birth averted, at all maternal ages from 30 to 43 years, amniocentesis was more cost-effective than chorionic villus sampling; at ages 44 and 45, chorionic villus sampling was more cost-effective. However, if the anxiety reduction provided by first-trimester diagnosis was equivalent to a 0.2% risk of an abnormal child, chorionic villus sampling was more cost-effective than amniocentesis at all maternal ages. Based on data from the 1988 United States natality cohort, the current policy of testing women aged 35 and older would cost $103,329 and $111,184 per abnormal birth averted for amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, respectively. Testing women aged 30 and older would almost double these costs. For either prenatal test, targeting high risk women for testing, and striving for utilization rates of 50% or higher, appeared to be the most cost-effective policy.","['Adult', 'Amniocentesis', 'Anxiety', 'Chorionic Villi Sampling', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Female', 'Genetic Testing', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', 'Maternal Age', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'United States']",8057700,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.050', 'E01.370.225.998.329.309', 'E01.370.378.630.050', 'E04.665.600.309', 'E05.200.500.384.050', 'E05.200.998.329.309', 'E05.242.384.050'], ['F01.470.132'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.149', 'E01.370.225.998.054.149', 'E01.370.378.630.150', 'E01.370.388.100.150', 'E04.074.149', 'E05.200.500.384.100.149', 'E05.200.998.054.149', 'E05.242.384.100.149'], ['C23.550.210', 'G05.365.590.175'], ['C16.131.260', 'C16.320.180'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['N03.219.151.125'], ['E05.245', 'L01.313.500.750.190'], ['E01.370.225.562', 'E05.200.562', 'E05.393.435', 'N02.421.308.430', 'N02.421.726.233.221'], ['I01.655.500.608.400', 'I01.880.604.825.608.400', 'N03.623.500.608.428'], ['H01.770.644.145.360', 'N03.349.380', 'N05.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G08.686.560', 'N05.715.350.075.550', 'N06.850.490.250.550'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E01.370.378.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
15310,Ginsenoside Rb1 promotes browning through regulation of PPARã in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.,"Browning of white adipocyte tissue (WAT) has received considerable attention due to its potential implication in preventing obesity and related comorbidities. Ginsenoside Rb1 is reported to improve glycolipid metabolism and reduce body weight in obese animals. However whether the body reducing effect mediates by browning effect remains unclear. For this purpose, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to study the effect of ginsenoside Rb1 on browning adipocytes specific genes and oxygen consumptions. The results demonstrate that 10 ìM of ginsenoside Rb1 increases basal glucose uptake and promoted browning evidenced by significant increases in mRNA expressions of UCP-1, PGC-1á and PRDM16 in 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes. Further, ginsenoside Rb1 also increases PPARã activity. And the browning effect is abrogated by GW9692, a PPARã antagonist. In addition, ginsenoside Rb1 increases basal respiration rate, ATP production and uncoupling capacity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Those effects are also blunted by GW9692. The results suggest that ginsenoside Rb1 promote browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes through induction of PPARã. Our finding offer a new source to discover browning agonists and also useful to understand and extend the applications of ginseng and its constituents.","['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Adipocytes, Brown', 'Adipocytes, White', 'Anilides', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ginsenosides', 'Glucose', 'Ion Channels', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'PPAR gamma', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Transcription Factors', 'Uncoupling Protein 1']",26381176,"[['A11.251.210.100.775.800', 'A11.329.228.100.775.800'], ['A11.329.114.249'], ['A11.329.114.500'], ['D02.065.199', 'D02.092.146.113'], ['B01.050'], ['G04.152'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G03.295'], ['D02.455.849.919.277', 'D09.408.782.300'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D12.776.157.530.400', 'D12.776.543.550.450', 'D12.776.543.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.776.575'], ['G03.680'], ['D12.776.826.239.588'], ['D12.644.360.024.314.650', 'D12.776.157.057.080.650', 'D12.776.157.725.813.875', 'D12.776.476.024.394.650', 'D12.776.660.675.650', 'D12.776.664.962.813.875', 'D12.776.930.617.650'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D12.776.930'], ['D12.776.157.530.937.598.500', 'D12.776.543.585.475.688.500', 'D12.776.543.585.937.696.500', 'D12.776.575.750.688.500']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
35732,Sodium nitrite blocks the activity of aminoglycosides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.,"Sodium nitrite has broad antimicrobial activity at pH 6.5, including the ability to prevent biofilm growth by Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the surfaces of airway epithelial cells. Because of its antimicrobial activity, nitrite is being investigated as an inhaled agent for chronic P. aeruginosa airway infections in cystic fibrosis patients. However, the interaction between nitrite and commonly used aminoglycosides is unknown. This paper investigates the interaction between nitrite and tobramycin in liquid culture, abiotic biofilms, and a biotic biofilm model simulating the conditions in the cystic fibrosis airway. The addition of nitrite prevented killing by aminoglycosides in liquid culture, with dose dependence between 1.5 and 15 mM. The effect was not blocked by the nitric oxide scavenger CPTIO or dependent on efflux pump activity. Nitrite shifted the biofilm minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC-biofilm) from 256 ìg/ml to >1,024 ìg/ml in an abiotic biofilm model. In a biotic biofilm model, the addition of 50 mM nitrite decreased the antibiofilm activity of tobramycin by up to 1.2 log. Respiratory chain inhibition recapitulated the inhibition of aminoglycoside activity by nitrite, suggesting a potential mechanism of inhibition of energy-dependent aminoglycoside uptake. In summary, sodium nitrite induces resistance to both gentamicin and tobramycin in P. aeruginosa grown in liquid culture, as an abiotic biofilm, or as a biotic biofilm.","['Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Biofilms', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Sodium Nitrite']",25801569,"[['D09.408.051'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['A20.593', 'G06.120'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625.100', 'B03.660.250.580.590.050'], ['D01.625.600.600.800', 'D01.857.775']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
49555,Characterization of alkali-treated collagen gels prepared by different crosslinkers.,"We have developed a naturally-derived crosslinker named malic acid derivative (MAD). In the present study, we prepared alkali-treated collagen (AlCol) gels with different crosslinkers including MAD and commercially available crosslinkers such as 1-ethyl-3-(3('-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and glutaraldehyde (GA). There are named as AlCol-MAD, AlCol-EDC, and AlCol-GA. We then compared their physicochemical properties. The residual amino groups in AlCol-MAD were not detected at MAD concentrations higher than 30 mM. On the other hand, the residual amino groups in AlCol-EDC and AlCol-GA were detected at crosslinker concentrations of 30 mM. The swelling ratios of AlCol-MAD, AlCol-EDC, and AlCol-GA decreased with increasing crosslinker concentration. Enzymatic degradation rate of AlCol-GA was slower than that of AlCol-MAD and AlCol-EDC. The cytotoxicity of MAD was clearly lower than that of EDC and GA. The number of adhered L929 on AlCol-MAD was higher than on AlCol-EDC and AlCol-GA after incubation for 1 day. After the culture for 3 and 7 days, excellent growth of L929 was observed on AlCol-MAD. These results suggested that MAD was excellent crosslinker for the reactivity with amino groups and cytocompatibility.

44494,Preference for an estrous female over a non-estrous female evinced by female rats requires dihydrotestosterone plus estradiol.,"The effects were studied of long-term treatment with testosterone metabolites (dihydrotestosterone. DHT, and estradiol, E2, in sc Silastic implants) on preference behavior of ovariectomized female rats for an estrous female over a non-estrous female. For measuring this behavior a residential plus-maze was used which harbored two ovariectomized ""stimulus"" females on the top of peripheral boxes, one of which was made estrus by injection of estradiol benzoate and progesterone. When both steroids (DHT plus E2) were circulating simultaneously they evoked preference for an estrous female, while neither steroid by itself sufficed. In earlier work with adult male rats castrated on the day of birth, E2 was effective in the absence of DHT. This sex difference, therefore, seems to have arisen before birth. Further, administration of DHT alone caused a profound lack of interest in both ""stimulus"" females, which cannot be fully explained by the reduced locomotor activity which has been found to be induced by DHT in earlier studies.","['Animals', 'Dihydrotestosterone', 'Drug Synergism', 'Estradiol', 'Estrus', 'Female', 'Ovariectomy', 'Progesterone', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sexual Behavior, Animal']",2606463,"[['B01.050'], ['D04.210.500.054.040.248', 'D06.472.334.851.968.964'], ['G07.690.773.968.477'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['G08.686.195.500'], ['E04.270.282.685', 'E04.950.165.685', 'E04.950.300.680'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829', 'D06.472.334.734.623', 'D06.472.334.851.687.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['F01.145.113.252.748']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
42003,Nuclear DNA sequence specific to Leishmania (Viannia) subgenus: a molecular marker for species identification.,"As shown by RFLP analysis, there is a high variability in the beta-tubulin gene region of Leishmania sp. Such variability has been used in the identification of these parasites, establishing differences between subgenera of New World Leishmania. We have found a region of 500 bp (beta500) upstream of the coding region of the beta-tubulin gene that is present in all strains tested belonging to the L. (Viannia) subgenus. This region apparently is a repetitive sequence and we have shown that it is specific to the Leishmania (Viannia) subgenus. This sequence has no homology with the genomic DNA isolated from either the species belonging to the L. (Leishmania) subgenus or other Kinetoplastida, such as Trypanosoma cruzi, T. brucei, Leptomonas samueli, or Crithidia fasciciulata. The beta500 sequence showed sufficient variation to be used as a molecular marker in the identification of parasites. We established inter- and intrasubgenus differentiation and were able to discriminate at the species level in the Vianna subgenus. A PCR assay confirmed the specificity of the beta500 sequence.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Intergenic', 'DNA, Protozoan', 'Genetic Markers', 'Leishmania', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Species Specificity', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tubulin']",11315173,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.114', 'E05.301.300.087', 'E05.601.150'], ['D13.444.308.324', 'G05.360.340.024.220'], ['D13.444.308.442'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['B01.268.475.868.488'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['G16.824'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800', 'G05.360.080.708.800', 'G05.360.340.024.850'], ['D05.750.078.734.800', 'D12.776.220.600.800', 'D12.776.631.920']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
29052,"[Sustained ventricular tachycardia in postinfarct ischemic heart disease: spontaneous polymorphism. Clinical, therapeutic and prognostic aspects].","UNLABELLED: Spontaneous Polymorphism (SP) is present when at least two episodes of Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia (SVT) occur spontaneously in the same patient (pt) with different bundle branch block pattern or with shifting of QRS axis by greater than or equal to 90 in the various episodes. We undertook this study in order to investigate the clinical significance of SP in SVT as well as therapeutic and prognostic implications. MATERIAL AND METHODS. From our global pts populations we chose those with SVT in chronic ischemic heart disease (CIHD) with previous myocardial infarction (PMI), they had to be already studied by electrophysiologic technique (EES). The pts were divided into two groups (Gr.): Gr. I: 13 SP pts (12 M, 1 F, mean age 57.5 +/- 13; mean follow-up 19.2 +/- 11 months); Gr. II: 15 no SP pts (14 M, 1 F, mean age 60 +/- 10; mean follow-up 9.9 +/- 13 months).RESULTS: The two Gr. are comparable in terms of symptoms, exercise tolerance, infarct site, intraventricular conduction disturbances (61.5% and 66.6% respectively), ventricular wells kinetics (38.4% and 26.6% respectively) and time interval between acute myocardial infarction the first episode of SVT (7.58 +/- 6.02 and 8.27 +/- 6.57 years respectively). 8 of the 10 alive Gr. I pts have been treated with Amiodarone (A) (2800-4200 mg/wk). All 9 alive Gr. II pts are on A (1400-4200 mg/wk). A serum level in 7 Gr. I pts was 1.7 +/- 0.65 mcg/ml and 1.61 +/- 0.67 in 5 Gr. II pts. 3/13 Gr. I pts died: 2 for sudden death (15.3%), 6/15 Gr.

7371,Attitudes of the Lebanese public regarding disclosure of serious illness.,"OBJECTIVES: To measure the preference regarding disclosure of a serious diagnosis, and its determinants, of the Lebanese public.DESIGN AND SETTING: Non-random sample survey of 400 persons interviewed in health care facilities in Beirut in 1995.RESULTS: Forty-two per cent of respondents generally preferred truth not to be disclosed directly to patients. Preference for disclosure was associated with younger age, better education and tendency to rapport-building with physicians. There were no meaningful associations between place of residence (urban/rural), level of religious practice, or religious affiliation, and preference for disclosure.CONCLUSIONS: Under one plausible interpretation, this survey suggests that the expectation for concealment will decrease as the advantage of knowledge in better coping with disease is understood by an increasingly better educated public, and that the Lebanese public will increasingly come to expect direct and full disclosure of serious diagnoses.","['Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Attitude to Health', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Islam', 'Lebanon', 'Male', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Truth Disclosure']",10536765,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.100.050', 'N05.300.100'], ['F01.100.150', 'N05.300.150'], ['N01.824.196'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['K01.844.275'], ['Z01.252.245.500.450'], ['F01.829.401.650.675', 'N05.300.660.625'], ['F01.829.401.046.800', 'I01.880.604.583.080.134.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
20689,"Differential regulation of single CFTR channels by PP2C, PP2A, and other phosphatases.","Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel activity declines rapidly when excised from transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or human airway cells because of membrane-associated phosphatase activity. In the present study, we found that CFTR channels usually remained active in patches excised from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells overexpressing CFTR. Those patches with stable channel activity were used to investigate the regulation of CFTR by exogenous protein phosphatases (PP). Adding PP2A, PP2C, or alkaline phosphatase to excised patches reduced CFTR channel activity by > 90% but did not abolish it completely. PP2B caused weak deactivation, whereas PP1 had no detectable effect on open probability (Po). Interestingly, the time course of deactivation by PP2C was identical to that of the spontaneous rundown observed in some patches after excision. PP2C and PP2A had distinct effects on channel gating Po declined during exposure to exogenous PP2C (and during spontaneous rundown, when it was observed) without any change in mean burst duration. By contrast, deactivation by exogenous PP2A was associated with a dramatic shortening of burst duration similar to that reported previously in patches from cardiac cells during deactivation of CFTR by endogenous phosphatases. Rundown of CFTR-mediated current across intact T84 epithelial cell monolayers was insensitive to toxic levels of the PP2A inhibitor calyculin A. These results demonstrate that exogenous PP2C is a potent regulator of CFTR activity, that its effects on single-channel gating are distinct from those of PP2A but similar to those of endogenous phosphatases in CHO, BHK, and T84 epithelial cells, and that multiple protein phosphatases may be required for complete deactivation of CFTR channels.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Electrophysiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels', 'Kidney', 'Magnesium', 'Marine Toxins', 'Oxazoles', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins']",9612228,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['A11.251.210.200', 'A11.436.155'], ['A11.251.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['D12.776.157.530.100.304.500', 'D12.776.157.530.400.175.125', 'D12.776.157.530.450.074.500.500.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.175.125', 'D12.776.543.585.100.304.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.175.125', 'D12.776.543.585.450.074.500.500.500.500'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.157.530.400', 'D12.776.543.550.450', 'D12.776.543.585.400'], ['A05.810.453'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['D23.946.580'], ['D03.383.129.462'], ['E05.200.500.905', 'E05.242.800'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.625'], ['D08.811.277.352.650'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.625.706', 'D12.644.360.583', 'D12.776.476.561'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.625.716'], ['D12.776.354.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
37198,Analysis of differential gene expression mediated by clozapine in human postmortem brains.,"Clozapine is the only medication indicated for treating refractory schizophrenia, due to its superior efficacy among all antipsychotic agents, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. To date, no studies of human postmortem brain have characterized the gene expression response to clozapine. Therefore, we addressed this question by analyzing expression data extracted from published microarray studies involving brains of patients on antipsychotic therapy. We first performed a systematic review and identified four microarray studies of postmortem brains from antipsychotic-treated patients, then extracted the expression data. We then performed generalized linear model analysis on each study separately, and identified the genes differentially expressed in response to clozapine compared to other atypical antipsychotic medications, as well as their associated canonical pathways. We also found a number of genes common to all four studies that we analyzed: GCLM, ZNF652, and GYPC. In addition, pathway analysis highlighted the following processes in all four studies: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, SAPK/JNK signaling, 3-phosphoinositide synthesis, and paxillin signaling. Our analysis yielded the first comprehensive compendium of genes and pathways differentially expressed upon clozapine treatment in the human brain, which may provide insight into the mechanism and unique efficacy of clozapine, as well as the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.","['Antipsychotic Agents', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Clozapine', 'Databases, Bibliographic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction']",28038920,"[['D27.505.696.277.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.210.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.700.872.331'], ['E01.370.060', 'E05.070', 'I01.198.780.937.120'], ['A08.186.211'], ['D03.633.300.240.220'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.300', 'L01.470.750.500'], ['G05.297'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F03.700.750'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
48194,Detection of Aggregation-Competent Tau in Neuron-Derived Extracellular Vesicles.,"Progressive cerebral accumulation of tau aggregates is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A popular theory that seeks to explain the apparent spread of neurofibrillary tangle pathology proposes that aggregated tau is passed from neuron to neuron. Such a templated seeding process requires that the transferred tau contains the microtubule binding repeat domains that are necessary for aggregation. While it is not clear how a protein such as tau can move from cell to cell, previous reports have suggested that this may involve extracellular vesicles (EVs). Thus, measurement of tau in EVs may both provide insights on the molecular pathology of AD and facilitate biomarker development. Here, we report the use of sensitive immunoassays specific for full-length (FL) tau and mid-region tau, which we applied to analyze EVs from human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuron (iN) conditioned media, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma. In each case, most tau was free-floating with a small component inside EVs. The majority of free-floating tau detected by the mid-region assay was not detected by our FL assays, indicating that most free-floating tau is truncated. Inside EVs, the mid-region assay also detected more tau than the FL assay, but the ratio of FL-positive to mid-region-positive tau was higher inside exosomes than in free solution. These studies demonstrate the presence of minute amounts of free-floating and exosome-contained FL tau in human biofluids. Given the potential for FL tau to aggregate, we conclude that further investigation of these pools of extracellular tau and how they change during disease is merited.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Apolipoproteins E', 'Biomarkers', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Exosomes', 'Extracellular Vesicles', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Male', 'Neurons', 'Protein Aggregates', 'Protein Aggregation, Pathological', 'tau Proteins']",29495441,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['C10.228.140.380.100', 'C10.574.945.249', 'F03.615.400.100'], ['D10.532.091.500', 'D12.776.070.400.500', 'D12.776.521.120.500'], ['D23.101'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['G04.152'], ['F03.615.250.700'], ['A11.284.295.588.750', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.880.495'], ['A11.284.295.588'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.872.040.500', 'A11.872.700.500'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D05.875'], ['C23.550.770', 'G02.111.675'], ['D12.776.220.600.450.510', 'D12.776.631.560.510']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
41321,[The utility of thermistor attached tracheal tube for pediatric patients in cardiac surgery].,"During cardiac surgery, esophageal, rectal, or bladder temperature is usually monitored as an index of core temperature; however, these methods are invasive, and often inconsistently reflect the central body temperature, especially in pediatric patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of tracheal temperature monitoring during cardiac surgery in pediatric patients. Fifteen children (ages; 8 m.-7 yr.) undergoing cardiac surgery with cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) were studied. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with high doses of fentanyl and intermittent doses of midazolam. After anesthetic induction, esophageal, rectal, bladder, tympanic, and forehead deep temperatures were monitored with a Core Temp Monitor (CTM-205, Terumo Co.). Simultaneously, the tracheal temperature was monitored with a specially made tracheal tube. A thermistor was attached by medical glue (Loctite Prism, Loctite Co.) at the anterior surface of a tracheal tube (Trachelon, Terumo Co.) without cuff (inside diameter 4.0-6.0 mm) where the tracheal tube tightly fits against the trachea. The inspired gas was warmed to 35 degrees C and humidified. During CPB, the blood temperature at the inlet to the patients was also recorded simultaneously. All indicated temperatures (Y) during CPB were analyzed for correlation with the blood temperature to the patients (X). The tracheal temperature had the highest correlation with the blood temperature from the patients (Y = 0.68X + 10.60, r = 0.89). There were also good correlations of the esophageal as well as bladder temperatures with blood temperature. There were no patients who suffered tracheal inflammation or laryngeal edema from the thermistor. Monitoring tracheal temperature is not only valuable for monitoring the core temperature, but also is convenient for pediatric patients in cardiac surgery.","['Anesthesia, General', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Body Temperature', 'Cardiac Surgical Procedures', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intubation, Intratracheal', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic']",7474320,"[['E03.155.197'], ['E05.601.043'], ['E01.370.600.875.374', 'G07.110'], ['E04.100.376', 'E04.928.220'], ['E04.292.413'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E02.041.500', 'E02.585.578', 'E05.497.578'], ['E01.370.520']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
37637,"Corneal hypoesthesia, aqueous tear deficiency, and neurotrophic keratopathy following micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation in dogs.","OBJECTIVE: To describe ocular surface complications following micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) in dogs.ANIMALS STUDIED: Eighteen dogs treated with MP-TSCPC at two institutions for glaucoma management.PROCEDURES: MP-TSCPC was applied to each eye (avoiding 3 and 9 o'clock positions) with 31.3% duty cycle, 2000-3000 mW energy, and 90-180 seconds duration per hemisphere. Central corneal tactile sensation (CTS) and Schirmer tear test-1 (STT-1) were measured at baseline and ?2 post-operative visits in each dog.RESULTS: Corneal sensitivity decreased in 16/18 dogs (89%) by an average of 10%-42% (up to 100% in 4 dogs). CTS decline was rapid (?1 week) and only fully recovered in 50% of dogs within 8-180 days. Patients' age, glaucoma duration, laser energy, and total energy delivered did not affect CTS at any visit. However, brachycephalic dogs had significantly lower CTS and likelihood to recover full sensation compared with nonbrachycephalic dogs. Aqueous tear deficiency (STT-1 < 15 mm/min) occurred in 8/18 dogs (44%) within 7-270 days, and concurrent signs of keratoconjunctivitis sicca were noted in 2/18 dogs (11%). Neurotrophic corneal ulcers developed in 6/18 dogs (33.3%) and required 16-53 days to heal.CONCLUSIONS: Corneal hypoesthesia is a common complication of MP-TSCPC in dogs, and can lead to serious adverse effects such as aqueous tear deficiency and neurotrophic corneal ulcers. Brachycephalic dogs represent a population at higher risk. Close monitoring of ocular surface health is recommended for months following MP-TSCPC in dogs.","['Animals', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Glaucoma', 'Hypesthesia', 'Laser Coagulation', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Tears']",31464376,"[['B01.050'], ['C11.204'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['C11.525.381'], ['C10.597.751.791.500', 'C23.888.592.763.770.500'], ['E02.520.745.410', 'E02.594.530', 'E04.014.520.530', 'E04.350.750.410', 'E04.540.630.410'], ['C23.550.767'], ['A12.200.882']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2454,Adolescent and adult differences in major depression symptom profiles.,"BACKGROUND: Depression is the leading global cause of disability and often begins in adolescence. The genetic architecture and treatment response profiles for adults and adolescents differ even though identical criteria are used to diagnose depression across different age groups. There is no clear consensus on how these groups differ in their symptom profiles.METHODS: Using data from a two-generation family study, we compared the presentation of DSM-IV depressive symptoms in adolescents and adults with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder). We also compared DSM-IV depressive symptom counts using latent class analysis.RESULTS: Vegetative symptoms (appetite and weight change, loss of energy and insomnia) were more common in adolescent MDD than adult MDD. Anhedonia/loss of interest and concentration problems were more common in adults with MDD. When using latent class analysis to look at depressive symptoms, a vegetative symptom profile was also seen in adolescent depression only.LIMITATIONS: Adults and adolescents were recruited in different ways. Adolescent cases were more likely to be first-onset while adult cases were recurrences. It was not possible to examine how recurrence affected adolescent depression symptom profiles.CONCLUSION: Differences in how depression presents in adolescents and adults may be consistent with different pathophysiological mechanisms. For adolescents, we found that vegetative/physical disturbances were common (loss of energy, changes in weight, appetite and sleep changes). For adults, anhedonia/loss of interest and concentration difficulties were more common.","['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Depression', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",30243197,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.145.022'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['F03.600.300.375'], ['L01.453.245.945.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.291.937']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
45745,Loss of androgen receptor expression predicts early recurrence in triple-negative and basal-like breast cancer.,"Treatment of triple-negative invasive breast cancers, defined by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and c-erbB2 expression, remains challenging. Androgen receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that is involved in signaling pathways regulating cell proliferation, has been implicated in breast tumorigenesis. We immunohistochemically examined the expression of androgen receptor, basal markers (CK14, 34âE12) and EGFR in 699 triple-negative invasive breast cancers in tissue microarrays using the streptavidin-biotin method, and correlated the findings with clinical outcome. Positive androgen receptor expression was defined as staining of 1% or more of tumor cell nuclei. Survival outcomes were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups with log-rank statistics. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the effect of androgen receptor on survival outcomes. Immunohistochemical positivity was observed in 38% of tumors, with the proportion of stained tumor cells ranging from 1 to 95% (mean 29%, median 10%). Androgen receptor expression was inversely associated with histologic grade and mitotic score. CK14, 34âE12 and EGFR confirmed 85% of cases to be basal-like, without significant association of basal-like phenotype with androgen receptor expression. Disease-free survival was significantly better in androgen receptor-positive triple-negative breast cancer, with a trend for improved overall survival. Decreased recurrence likelihood in both triple-negative and basal-like tumors (hazard ratio, 0.704; 95% confidence intervals, 0.498-0.994; P=0.0464; and hazard ratio, 0.675; 95% confidence intervals, 0.468-0.974; P=0.0355, respectively) was noted within 5 years of diagnosis but not thereafter. Our study suggests that loss of androgen receptor in triple-negative breast cancers augurs a worse prognosis, including those with basal-like features. More work in elucidating its relationship with mechanisms of progression, as well as trials of targeted treatment for androgen receptor-expressing triple-negative tumors, needs to be performed.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptors, Androgen', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms']",23929266,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D23.101.140'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['D12.776.826.750.150'], ['E05.588.570.850'], ['C04.588.180.788', 'C17.800.090.500.788']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

Absorption of biogenic amines by the lungs tended to increase in all the animals under hypovolemic hypotension. In the group of non-survivors the serotonin absorption by the lungs in the post-terminal period remained increased, while in the group of survivors it came down to normal soon, though the histamine release was increased. The above processes were aggravated in the group of animals whose lungs were affected by oleic acid. It resulted in the absorption of histamine instead of its release. The intensified absorption of biogenic amines by the lungs was accompanied by a quick fall in cardiac output, by the increase in resistance of systemic and pulmonary circulation.","['Animals', 'Blood Volume', 'Cardiac Output', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Hemodynamics', 'Histamine', 'Hypotension', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Serotonin', 'Time Factors', 'Vascular Resistance']",2337643,"[['B01.050'], ['G09.188.130', 'G09.330.380.092'], ['E01.370.370.380.150', 'G09.330.380.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G09.330.380'], ['D02.092.211.215.501', 'D02.092.471.440', 'D03.383.129.308.373', 'D23.469.050.300'], ['C14.907.514'], ['A04.411'], ['D02.092.211.215.801.852', 'D03.633.100.473.914.814', 'D23.469.050.650'], ['G01.910.857'], ['G09.330.380.921']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We networked these synthetic gates to an endogenous signaling circuit and devised a physiological output.

1762,Cigarette smoking in the U.S. military: findings from the 1992 Worldwide Survey.,"BACKGROUND: Using data from the military's Worldwide Survey series, this article presents findings on the prevalence of smoking among active-duty military personnel in 1992 and trends since 1980.METHODS: A stratified probability sampling design was used in the 1992 Worldwide Survey. Military installations worldwide were sampled, and then active-duty personnel within these installations were selected. A total of 16,395 usable questionnaires were obtained, for an overall response rate of 77.3%.RESULTS: The prevalence of cigarette smoking among military personnel has declined from 51% in 1980 to 35% in 1992. This decline was not explained by changes in the sociodemographic composition of the military population. Overall, smoking was more prevalent among personnel who were white, had less education, and were enlisted. In addition, enlisted men reporting higher levels of work-related stress were more likely to be smokers. Over half of all military personnel who were smokers in the past year attempted to quit.CONCLUSIONS: The military has made considerable progress since 1980 in reducing the prevalence of smoking among military personnel. Nonetheless, the prevalence in 1992 was still relatively high, affecting about one of every three personnel. A promising group to target in future antismoking efforts may be smokers who tried to quit during the past year.","['Adult', 'Data Collection', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Military Personnel', 'Probability', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sampling Studies', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation', 'United States']",7971881,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.308', 'L01.399.250', 'N05.715.360.300', 'N06.850.520.308'], ['I01.240', 'N01.224', 'N06.850.505.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.526.625'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['E05.318.372.875', 'N05.715.360.330.875', 'N06.850.520.450.875'], ['F01.145.805'], ['F01.145.488.732'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
20080,Effect of diet of varying protein concentrations on the activity of erythrocyte membrane Ca2+Mg2+ ATPase in dogs.,"Alterations in protein diet have been reported to result in alterations in calcium homeostasis in the body. Ca2+Mg2+ATPase is an ubiquitous enzyme important in calcium homeostasis in the body. The effect of varying protein diet on the activities of Ca2+ pump across cell membranes is however yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, the activity of erythrocyte membrane calcium pump in response to varying protein concentration in diet was therefore studied in the dog. The study was carried out in 24 dogs, randomly divided into 4 groups. The groups were fed with diets containing 30%, 26%, 16% and 0% proteins (high, medium, low and zero) for six weeks respectively. Blood samples were collected from each animal to determine packed cell volumes, hematocrit, blood urea, electrolyte studies and erythrocyte ghost membrane studies. The effects of Ca2+ and ATP on the activity of Ca2+Mg2+ ATPase were determined in the isolated ghost membrane. The result of the study shows that there was a protein diet dependent increase in the activity of Ca2+Mg2+ ATPase in the presence and absence of ATP in all the groups with the highest activity recorded in the high protein diet group and the lowest activity observed in the zero protein group. There was also a protein diet dependent increase in the protein concentration of the membranes in all groups observed with the highest protein concentration recorded in the high protein diet group and the lowest activity observed in the zero protein group. There was a significant decrease in K+ concentration (P <0.05) and a significant increase in urea concentration of animals fed with high protein diet (P <0.05). There was also a significant increase (P <0.05) in HCO3- concentration in the animals fed with medium protein diet and no significant difference in the PCV and heamatocrit values in all groups. This study has shown that high protein diets increase the activity of the Ca2+Mg2+ ATPase in the presence and absence of ATP.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Dogs', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythrocyte Membrane', 'Random Allocation']",22314906,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.095'], ['D12.776.256', 'G07.203.300.428', 'J02.500.428'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['A11.118.290.270', 'A11.284.149.356', 'A15.145.229.334.270'], ['E05.318.370.700', 'E05.581.500.805', 'N05.715.360.325.675', 'N06.850.520.445.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

29831,Hypercortisolemic depression is associated with the metabolic syndrome in late-life.,"INTRODUCTION: Depression has been hypothesized to be associated with metabolic abnormalities which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Such a link could be due to increased HPA-axis activity. This study investigates the cross-sectional relationship between depression, urinary cortisol and metabolic syndrome in an older population.METHODS: Data are from 867 participants of the InChianti Study, aged 65 years. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D scale; cortisol levels were determined in 24-h urine samples. Metabolic syndrome was defined as three or more of the following: abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high fasting glucose.RESULTS: Clinically relevant depressed mood (CES-D20) was present in 20.6% of the sample, and 24.5% had the metabolic syndrome. After adjustment for sociodemographics and health indicators, depression score (per SD increase: OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.02-1.41) and urinary cortisol level (per SD increase: OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.01-1.51) were significantly associated with presence of metabolic syndrome. There was, however, a significant interaction (p=0.003) between depressed mood and urinary cortisol in the probability of having metabolic syndrome. The odds of metabolic syndrome in persons with both depressed mood and urinary cortisol excretion in the highest tertile was 1.84 (95% CI=1.02-3.34) compared to persons with neither condition.DISCUSSION: This study suggests a synergistic relationship between depression, cortisol and metabolic syndrome. Hypercortisolemic depression may constitute a specific risk group for the metabolic syndrome.","['Affect', 'Aged', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cholesterol, HDL', 'Depression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Obesity']",17224244,"[['F01.470.047'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['D04.210.500.247.808.197.238', 'D10.532.432.400', 'D10.570.938.208.270', 'D12.776.521.479.470'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['C14.907.489'], ['C18.452.584.500.500.851'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['C18.452.394.968.500.570', 'C18.452.625'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
13161,"Significance of carbohydrate epitopes in a latex allergen with beta-1,3-glucanase activity.","BACKGROUND: One of the latex allergens, Hev b 2, has beta-1,3-glucanase activity. The entire sequence of this allergen is already known. There is one potential N-glycosylation site in this molecule ((27)Asn). Heterogeneous glycosylation of this Asn residue could be a source of the multiplicity of natural Hev b 2. Possible participation of the carbohydrate epitopes of latex beta-1,3-glucanase isoenzymes in their IgE-binding capacity and cross-reactivity was investigated in this study.METHODS: beta-1,3-Glucanase isoenzymes were separated based on their affinities for concanavalin A. IgE-binding capacity and cross-reactivity were examined by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sequence heterogeneity among the isoenzymes was probed by peptide mass mapping after lysyl endopeptidase digestion. To clarify the relation to Hev b 2, N-terminal sequencing was performed on a fragmented peptide common to the separated isoenzymes.RESULTS: Basic beta-1,3-glucanase was subdivided into two glycosylated isoenzymes (GI and GII) and one non-glycosylated isoenzyme (GIII). IgE antibodies in latex-positive sera chiefly recognized the glycosylated isoenzymes. Inhibition ELISA supported the significance of the carbohydrate epitopes for the IgE recognition and cross-reactivity. However, non-glycosylated GIII, as well as GI and GII, produced positive results in a skin prick test. The three beta-1,3-glucanase isoenzymes shared a partial sequence in common with Hev b 2.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the carbohydrate epitopes in Hev b 2 homologues are relevant to an in vitro diagnosis of latex allergy and the accompanying cross-reactivity. Carbohydrate epitopes do not necessarily provoke allergic symptoms. Therefore, the actual allergenicity of Hev b 2 and its homologues should be carefully evaluated not only by in vitro IgE tests but also by in vivo tests.","['Adult', 'Allergens', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Glucan 1,3-beta-Glucosidase', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Isoenzymes', 'Latex Hypersensitivity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'beta-Glucosidase']",12372996,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D23.050.063'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['D23.050.550'], ['D08.811.277.450.420.200.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.312', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.312', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.312'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['C20.543.600'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D08.811.277.450.420.200.100']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
5065,Cell internalization of the third helix of the Antennapedia homeodomain is receptor-independent.,"We have recently reported that a 16-amino acid long polypeptide corresponding to the third helix of the DNA binding domain (homeodomain) of Antennapedia, a Drosophila transcription factor, is internalized by cells in culture (Derossi, D., Joliot, A. H., Chassaing, G., and Prochiantz, A.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10444-10450). The capture of the homeodomain and of its third helix at temperatures below 10 degrees C raised the problem of the mechanism of internalization. The present demonstration, that a reverse helix and a helix composed of D-enantiomers still translocate across biological membranes at 4 and 37 degrees C strongly suggests that the third helix of the homeodomain is internalized by a receptor-independent mechanism. The finding that introducing 1 or 3 prolines in the structure does not hamper internalization also demonstrates that the alpha-helical structure is not necessary. The data presented are compatible with a translocation process based on the establishment of direct interactions with the membrane phospholipids. The third helix of the homeodomain has been used successfully to address biologically active substances to the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells in culture (Th?odore, L., Derossi, D., Chassaing, G., Llirbat, B., Kubes, M., Jordan, P., Chneiweiss, H., Godement, P., and Prochiantz, A.(1995) J. Neurosci. 15, 7158-7167). Therefore, in addition to their physiological implications (Prochiantz, A., and Th?odore, L.(1995) BioEssays 17, 39-45), the present results open the way to the molecular design of cellular vectors.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antennapedia Homeodomain Protein', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corpus Striatum', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Transcription Factors']",8663410,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.260.400.124', 'D12.776.660.049', 'D12.776.930.120'], ['G03.143'], ['A11.284.149'], ['A11.251'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487'], ['D12.776.260.400'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D12.776.660'], ['D12.644.541'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.600'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
29063,Common carotid intima-media thickness and lower extremity arterial atherosclerosis. The Rotterdam Study.,"High-resolution B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid arteries is used to investigate the signs of early atherosclerotic vessel wall disease. To assess whether carotid artery findings reflect atherosclerosis elsewhere, we studied the association between common carotid intima-media thickness and lower extremity arterial atherosclerosis among the first 1000 participants of the Rotterdam Study. The Rotterdam Study is a single-center population-based prospective follow-up study of 7983 subjects, > or = 55 years old. Baseline measurements include ultrasound imaging of intima-media thickness of the distal common carotid artery and determination of the ankle-to-arm systolic blood pressure index. Lower extremity arterial disease was defined as an ankle-arm index < 0.90 in at least one leg. An increase of 0.1 mm in common carotid artery intima-media thickness was associated with an age- and sex-adjusted reduction of the ankle-arm index of 0.026 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.018 to 0.034). The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio of lower extremity arterial disease for subjects with an intima-media thickness > or = 0.89 mm (upper quintile) to that of subjects with an intima-media thickness < 0.89 mm was 3.4 (95% CI: 2.2 to 5.2). Analysis among subjects free from symptomatic cardiovascular disease yielded a reduction in ankle-arm index per 0.1 mm increase in intima-media thickness of 0.018 (95% CI: 0.008 to 0.28) and an odds ratio for lower extremity arterial disease of 3.0 (95% CI: 1.7 to 5.1).

24853,Blood pressure and hypertension are associated with 7 loci in the Japanese population.,"BACKGROUND: Two consortium-based genome-wide association studies have recently identified robust and significant associations of common variants with systolic and diastolic blood pressures in populations of European descent, warranting further investigation in populations of non-European descent.METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the associations at 27 loci reported by the genome-wide association studies on Europeans in a screening panel of Japanese subjects (n=1526) and chose 11 loci showing association signals (1-tailed test in the screening, P<0.3) for an extensive replication study with a follow-up panel of 3 Japanese general-population cohorts (n < or =24 300). Significant associations were replicated for 7 loci-CASZ1, MTHFR, ITGA9, FGF5, CYP17A1-CNNM2, ATP2B1, and CSK-ULK3-with any or all of these 3 traits: systolic blood pressure (P=1.4x10(-14) to 0.05), diastolic blood pressure (P=1.9x10(-12) to 0.05), and hypertension (P=2.0x10(-14) to 0.006; odds ratio, 1.10 to 1.29). The strongest association was observed for FGF5. In the whole study panel, the variance (R(2)) for blood pressure explained by the 7 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci was calculated to be R(2)=0.003 for male and 0.006 for female participants. Stratified analysis implied the potential presence of a gene-age-sex interaction, although it did not reach a conclusive level of statistical significance after adjustment for multiple testing.CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed 7 loci associated with blood pressure and/or hypertension in the Japanese. These loci can guide fine-mapping efforts to pinpoint causal variants and causal genes with the integration of multiethnic results.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 5', 'Genetic Loci', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Integrins', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasma Membrane Calcium-Transporting ATPases', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase', 'Transcription Factors', 'Young Adult']",20479155,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['M01.686.508.200'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['D12.776.260'], ['D12.644.276.624.150', 'D12.776.467.624.150', 'D23.529.624.150'], ['G05.360.340.024.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.408'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.250.249', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.500.249', 'D12.776.157.530.813.250.249', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.500.249', 'D12.776.543.585.813.250.249'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700'], ['D08.244.453.487.500', 'D08.244.453.915.748', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.444.500', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.915.748', 'D12.776.422.220.453.487.500', 'D12.776.422.220.453.915.748'], ['D12.776.930'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
31169,[Analysis and radiologic staging of the type and severity of aspiration].,"The estimated number of the incidence of undiagnosed chronic aspiration pneumonia after cerebral or cerebrovascular injury seems very high. According to American statistics, at least 6% of these patients die from aspiration pneumonia within the first year. The high temporal resolution of cineradiography with frame rates of the complex process of pharyngeal swallowing lasting 0.7 s. The method enables us to differentiate between so-called pre-, intra- and postdeglutitive aspiration, which means aspiration before, during and after the triggering of the swallowing reflex.

48714,"The effect of age on sagittal plane profile of the lumbar spine according to standing, supine, and various sitting positions.","BACKGROUND: The sagittal alignment of the spine changes depending on body posture and degenerative changes. This study aimed to observe changes in sagittal alignment of the lumbar spine with different positions (standing, supine, and various sitting postures) and to verify the effect of aging on lumbar sagittal alignment.METHODS: Whole-spine lateral radiographs were obtained for young volunteers (25.4 ± 2.3 years) and elderly volunteers (66.7 ± 1.7 years). Radiographs were obtained in standing, supine, and sitting (30°, 60°, and 90°) positions respectively. We compared the radiological changes in the lordotic and segmental angles in different body positions and at different ages. Upper and lower lumbar lordosis were defined according to differences in anatomical sagittal mobility and kinematic behavior.RESULTS: Lumbar lordosis was greater in a standing position (52.79° and 53.90° in young and old groups, respectively) and tended to decrease as position changed from supine to sitting. Compared with the younger group, the older group showed significantly more lumbar lordosis in supine and 60° and 90° sitting positions (P=0.043, 0.002, 0.011). Upper lumbar lordosis in the younger group changed dynamically in all changed positions compared with the old group (P=0.019). Lower lumbar lordosis showed a decreasing pattern in both age groups, significantly changing as position changed from 30° to 60° (P=0.007, 0.007).CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar lordosis decreases as position changes from standing to 90°sitting. The upper lumbar spine is more flexible in individuals in their twenties compared to those in their sixties. Changes in lumbar lordosis were concentrated in the lower lumbar region in the older group in sitting positions.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', 'Posture', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiography', 'Spine', 'Young Adult']",24571953,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['G11.427.695'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E01.370.350.700'], ['A02.835.232.834'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
8419,"Molecular Cloning, Functional Characterization and Nutritional Regulation of the Putative Elongase Elovl5 in the Orange-Spotted Grouper (Epinephelus coioides).","The enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) are widely studied in fish species, as fish are the main source of n-3 LC-PUFAs for human beings. In the present study, a putative gene for elovl5, which encodes a key enzyme involved in LC-PUFA synthesis, was cloned and functionally characterized, and its transcription in response to dietary n-3 LC-PUFA exposure was investigated. Moreover, cell transfection and luciferase assays were used to explore the mechanism underlying the regulation of elovl5. The full-length cDNA of elovl5 was 1242 bp (excluding the polyA tail), including an 885 bp coding region encoding a 295 amino acid protein that possesses all of the characteristic features of elovl proteins. Functional characterization of heterologously expressed grouper Elovl5 indicated that it effectively elongates both C18 (18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3) and C20 (20:4n-6 and C20:5n-3) PUFAs, but not the C22 substrates. The expression of elovl5 was significantly affected by dietary n-3 LC-PUFA exposure: a high n-3 LC-PUFA level repressed the expression of elovl5 by slightly down-regulating the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 and liver X receptor (LXR) á, which are major regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism. Promoter studies showed that grouper elovl5 reporter activity was induced by over-expression of LXRá but not SREBP-1. This finding suggests that elovl5 is a direct target of LXRá, which is involved in the biosynthesis of PUFAs via transcriptional regulation of elovl5. These findings may contribute to a further understanding of the mechanism underlying the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in marine fish species.","['Acetyltransferases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bass', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny']",26950699,"[['D08.811.913.050.134'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.602.105'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D10.251.355'], ['G05.308.320'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
3320,Antinociceptive effects of intrathecal landiolol injection in a rat formalin pain model.,"Perioperative beta-blocker administration has recently been recommended for patients undergoing cardiac or other surgery due to the beneficial cardiovascular effects of these agents. In addition, some studies have reported that perioperatively administered beta-blockers also have analgesic effects. In this study, to investigate the antinociceptive effects and the analgesic profile of landiolol, we examined the effects of intrathecal landiolol administration on nociceptive pain behavior and c-fos mRNA expression (a neural marker of pain) in the spinal cord using a rat formalin model. We found that pain-related behavior was inhibited by intrathecal landiolol administration. Moreover, the increase in c-fos mRNA expression on the formalin-injected side was less pronounced in rats administered landiolol than in saline administered controls. Thus, intrathecal administration of landiolol exhibited antinociceptive effects. Further investigation of the antinociceptive mechanism of landiolol is required.","['Analgesics', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Formaldehyde', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Morpholines', 'Pain', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Urea']",22729110,"[['D27.505.696.663.850.014', 'D27.505.954.427.040'], ['B01.050'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['D02.047.407'], ['E02.319.267.530.580'], ['D03.383.533.640'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['D12.776.260.108.765', 'D12.776.624.664.700.179', 'D12.776.660.760', 'D12.776.930.127.765'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D02.065.950']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27499,Tumor suppressor WARTS ensures genomic integrity by regulating both mitotic progression and G1 tetraploidy checkpoint function.,"Defects in chromosomes or mitotic spindles activate the spindle checkpoint, resulting in cell cycle arrest at prometaphase. The prolonged activation of spindle checkpoint generally leads to mitotic exit without segregation after a transient mitotic arrest and the consequent formation of tetraploid G(1) cells. These tetraploid cells are usually blocked to enter the subsequent S phase by the activation of p53/pRb pathway, which is referred to as the G(1) tetraploidy checkpoint. A human homologue of the Drosophila warts tumor suppressor, WARTS, is an evolutionarily conserved serine-threonine kinase and implicated in development of human tumors. We previously showed that WARTS plays a crucial role in controlling mitotic progression by forming a regulatory complex with zyxin, a regulator of actin filament assembly, on mitotic apparatus. However, when WARTS is activated during cell cycle and how the loss of WARTS function leads to tumorigenesis have not been elucidated. Here we show that WARTS is activated during mitosis in mammalian cells, and that overexpression of a kinase-inactive WARTS in Rat1 fibroblasts significantly induced mitotic delay. This delay resulted from prolonged activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and was frequently followed by mitotic slippage and the development of tetraploidy. The resulting tetraploid cells then abrogated the G(1) tetraploidy checkpoint and entered S phase to achieve a DNA content of 8N. This impairment of G(1) tetraploidy checkpoint was caused as a consequence of failure to induce p53 expression by expressing a kinase-inactive WARTS. WARTS thus plays a critical role in maintenance of ploidy through its actions in both mitotic progression and the G(1) tetraploidy checkpoint.","['Actins', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA', 'Drosophila', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Fibroblasts', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase', 'Genome', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitosis', 'Ploidies', 'Polyploidy', 'Protein Kinases', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Rats', 'S Phase', 'Spindle Apparatus', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",15122335,"[['D05.750.078.730.250', 'D12.776.210.500.100', 'D12.776.220.525.255'], ['B01.050'], ['G04.144'], ['D13.444.308'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.750.310.250'], ['D12.776.093.500.462'], ['A11.329.228'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['G04.144.500.320'], ['G05.360.340'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['G04.144.220.220.781', 'G05.113.220.781'], ['G05.700'], ['C23.550.210.702', 'G05.365.590.175.677', 'G05.700.740'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['G02.111.225.880', 'G04.144.500.800', 'G05.226.880'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750.820'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Research in Developmental Disabilities, 24, 391-404] by examining the convergent validity of the behavior problems inventory (BPI) and the aberrant behavior checklist (ABC) for individuals presenting with multiple complex behavior problems. Data were collected from 69 children and adults with severe intellectual disabilities and challenging behavior living in residential establishments.

Multiple regression analyses showed a corresponding pattern of results in the prediction of ABC subscale scores by BPI subscale scores.

3636,The cost of immunosuppressive therapies currently used in patients with thyroid eye disease.,"Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an inflammatory condition of the orbit occurring in patients with autoimmune disease. In patients with mild TED, the most important therapeutic measure is reassurance. In severe cases, immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment and around 10 immunosuppressive regimens have been suggested and used in such patients so far. The efficacy of these regimens varies according to the number of studies that have addressed these issues. ""Response"" to the treatment is also variably defined. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has reported on the cost of immunosuppressive therapy in such patients. The aim of this study was mainly to provide information concerning the cost of different immunosuppressive regimens that patients with active thyroid ophthalmopathy undergo in different European countries. We have shown that the cheapest treatment is oral glucocorticoids (GC) and the most expensive is iv immunoglobulins. Cyclosporine is the second cheapest treatment. Radiotherapy plus oral GC have a cost between 850-3200 Euro; while SS analogues (SS-a) are expensive with a cost between 5000-10000 Euro. However, it is worth noting that the patients studied so far in this group were only few and most of them selected on a basis of a positive octreoscan, the cost of which has to be considered when choosing this type of treatment. Germany is by far the most expensive country as regards the costs of the main remedies, whereas Greece is the cheapest.

2801,[Identification of the nucleotide sequences specific for the 5'-flanking regions of the genes regulated by glucocorticoids by a computer analysis method].,"Nucleotide sequences of 5'-flanking regions of 11 glucocorticoid-regulated genes and 14 genes non-regulated by these hormones were studied using context computer analysis. Consensus TGTTCT, previously found in DNA fragments protected by glucocorticoid-receptor complexes from DNAase I digestion, was shown to be nonspecific for glucocorticoid-regulated genes. However, the analysis of sequences flanking the TGTTCT consensus has revealed that only glucocorticoid-regulated genes contain four regularly distributed cytosine residues, one of them belonging to TGTTCT consensus. Three of cytosine residues are separated by 8-10 bp, which provides their close neighbourhood at one side of DNA double helix; the fourth extreme cytosine residue is located 6 bp from the nearest one and therefore, the complementary guanine residue is adjacent to the consensus in DNA helix. It is suggested that the consensus itself and two flanking cytosine and one guanine residues form a specific site for the interaction with glucocorticoid-receptor complex.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Computers', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA, Viral', 'Genes', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse', 'Mice', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid']",3008884,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['L01.224.230.260'], ['D03.383.742.698.421'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['G05.360.340.024.340'], ['D06.472.040.543', 'D27.505.696.399.472.488'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B04.613.807.124.500', 'B04.820.650.124.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.826.750.430']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

39256,[Study on effect of voltage-gated calcium channel protein in meridian tissue cells exciting conduction].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the material basis of conduction along meridian.METHODS: Sixty SD rats(30 males,30 females) were randomly assigned into a normal group,an acupuncture group,a verapamil blocking group and a 0.9%NaCl blocking group(control group),15 rats in each one. Fluo 3-AM(calcium fluorescence probe) was injected at the observation part in femoral stomach meridian of foot-yangming(meridian part) and the approaching femoral meridian part(non-meridian part) in the normal group and the acupuncture group,and then incubation was applied. In the verapamil blocking group,verapamil was injected at local meridian part and non-meridian part,and in the control group 0.9%NaCl was injected. Then Fluo 3-AM was injected at the meridian part and non-meridian part in the two groups,and incubation was implemented. Ca2+ imaging changes in cells were recorded for more than 20 min after injection of every part in each group respectively. After the above operations in the last three groups,acupuncture was used at ""Zusanli""(ST 36) immediately,with electroacupuncture for one min,then Ca2+ imaging changes in cells at the meridian and non-meridian parts were recorded for more than 20 min.RESULTS: In the normal group, Ca2+ fluorescence intensity at the meridian part was higher than that at the non-meridian part. In the acupuncture group,after acupuncture Ca2+ fluorescence intensity at the meridian part was obviously higher than before,but the change before and after acupuncture was not apparent at the non-meridian part. After verapamil blocking local calcium channel and acupuncture,the Ca2+ fluorescence of the meridian part did not strengthen,and the change of that before and after acupuncture at the non-meridian part was not obvious. In the control group,after injecting 0.9%NaCl at local part,Ca2+ fluorescence intensities of the meridian and non-meridian parts showed no obvious change,so was that before and after acupuncture.CONCLUSIONS: The voltage-gated calcium channel at the meridian part is highly correlated with its tissue cells exciting conduction.","['Acupuncture Points', 'Animals', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Calcium Channels', 'Electroacupuncture', 'Female', 'Male', 'Meridians', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Verapamil']",29231525,"[['E02.190.044.555.035'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.562.249', 'D27.505.696.260.500', 'D27.505.954.411.192'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150'], ['E02.186.250', 'E02.190.044.244', 'E02.331.399', 'E02.779.468.399', 'E02.831.535.468.399', 'E03.091.823.500', 'E03.155.519'], ['E02.190.044.555', 'I01.076.201.450.654.558.520.300.500'], ['E05.318.370.700', 'E05.581.500.805', 'N05.715.360.325.675', 'N06.850.520.445.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D02.092.471.683.953']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

We conducted a hospital-based case-control study including 182 cases with newly diagnosed SCCHN and 202 controls with nonneoplastic conditions of the head and neck that required surgery. Lifetime tobacco use and risk of SCCHN were evaluated in relation to the polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, CYP1A1, and NAT1. The main effects of genotype were associated with a slightly increased risk of SCCHN for GSTP1 [age-, race-, and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.2; confidence interval (CI), 0.8-1.9], GSTT1 (OR, 1.2; CI, 0.7-2.3), and NAT1 (OR, 1.1; CI, 0.7-1.7). The joint effects of genotype combinations showed some excess risk for the combination of the GSTM1 null genotype and the CYP1A1 Ile/Val polymorphism (OR, 2.6; CI, 0.7-10.3). The analysis of the joint effects (interaction) of the ""at-risk"" genotypes and tobacco use did not reveal any interaction on either the multiplicative or additive scale for GSTM1, GSTP1, or CYP1A1. However, there was a suggestion of an interaction on the additive scale between the pack-years of tobacco use and the GSTT1 null genotype. The combined heterozygote and homozygote NAT1*10 genotypes also had a suggestive interaction with tobacco smoking history.

Results indicated significant pre-post changes for the EG and MG for Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)-measured delinquency and aggression, but no improvement for the CG. Positive relationships between the number of individual ORP components (e.g. number of children's CBT sessions) received and CBCL change scores were also found. Statistical associations tended to be larger for girls and older children (i.e. 10-11 years old) who may have been more cognitively advanced. Also, the number of children's CBT sessions predicted later convictions, even after controlling for prior CBCL delinquency scores.

35712,Non-contact confocal microscopy of the tear film in unoperated eyes.,"PURPOSE: The NIDEK ConfoScan4 (CS4) is a digital scanning slit confocal microscope. The corneal structure and tear film can be viewed, magnified, measured, and photographed at magnifications up to 500x, in vivo, in a noninvasive manner. The objective of this study was to evaluate and illustrate various conditions related to dry eye using the CS4 confocal microscope with the 20x noncontact lens.METHODS: The CS4 was used to evaluate the natural tear film in 58 eyes of 29 patients with normal examinations, allergic conjunctivitis, nonspecific conjunctivitis, and dry eyes. In a subset of this patient population, subjective and objective findings were used to classify mild, moderate, and severe dry eye disease states. The usefulness of confocal microscopy as an objective tool to diagnose and manage different tear film-related ocular disease was also evaluated.RESULTS: The differences in tear film composition were visible using confocal microscopy. Photographs demonstrate confocal noncontact 20x microscopy as a diagnostic tool.CONCLUSIONS: Noncontact confocal microscopy is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and treatment of dry eye syndrome and other ocular states such as allergic and nonspecific conjunctivitis. It provides a simple and effective way to observe, classify, and treat the tear film.

1468,Effects of voluntary exercise on hippocampal long-term potentiation in morphine-dependent rats.,"This study was designed to examine the effect of voluntary exercise on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in morphine-dependent rats. The rats were randomly distributed into the saline-sedentary (Sal/Sed), the dependent-sedentary, the saline-exercise (Sal/Exc), and the dependent-exercise (D/Exc) groups. The Sal/Exc and the D/Exc groups were allowed to freely exercise in a running wheel for 10 days. The Sal/Sed and the morphine-sedentary groups were kept sedentary for the same extent of time. Morphine (10 mg/kg) was injected bi-daily (12 h interval) during 10 days of voluntary exercise. On day 11, 2h after the morphine injection, the in vivo LTP in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was examined. The theta frequency primed bursts were delivered to the perforant path for induction of LTP. Population spike (PS) amplitude and the field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSP) slope were measured as indices of increase in synaptic efficacy. Chronic morphine increased the mean basal EPSP, and augmented PS-LTP. Exercise significantly increased the mean baseline EPSP and PS responses, and augmented PS-LTP in both saline and morphine-treated groups. Moreover, the increase of PS-LTP in the morphine-exercise group was greater (22.5%), but not statistically significant, than that of the Sal/Exc group. These results may imply an additive effect between exercise and morphine on mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Such an interaction between exercise and chronic morphine may influence cognitive functions in opiate addicts.","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials', 'Hippocampus', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Male', 'Morphine Dependence', 'Physical Conditioning, Animal', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Time Factors']",24141180,"[['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['B01.050'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['E05.723.402'], ['G04.580.887.249', 'G07.265.675.887.249', 'G07.265.880.750.199', 'G11.561.570.918.249', 'G11.561.830.750.199'], ['A08.186.211.180.405', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.345'], ['G11.561.638.350'], ['C25.775.643.500.600', 'F03.900.647.500.600'], ['G11.427.410.698.277.280'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The microbiological investigation of the sputum specimens revealed diagnostically significant titers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella spp. The isolates except for one case (Ps.aeruginosa) were susceptible to ofloxacin. The treatment with ofloxacin in accordance with the above scheme resulted in a rapid improvement of the patient state: the intoxication lowered, the expectoration and the sputum viscosity decreased, the body temperature normalized by the 5th day. The drug tolerance after the intravenous and enteral administration was good. The intravenous injections of ofloxacin induced a 1.5-fold increase in the intensity of the neutrophil oxygen burst. After the drug enteral administration there was observed a 2-fold increase the intensity of the neutrophil oxygen burst.","['Administration, Oral', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Klebsiella', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neutrophils', 'Ofloxacin', 'Prognosis', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Respiratory Burst', 'Sputum', 'Staphylococcus aureus']",9005785,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['D27.505.954.122'], ['C06.689.202', 'C08.381.187', 'C16.320.190', 'C16.614.213'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B03.440.450.425.425', 'B03.660.250.150.400'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['D03.633.100.810.835.322.500'], ['E01.789'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625.100', 'B03.660.250.580.590.050'], ['G03.197.620', 'G04.270.620'], ['A12.200.808'], ['B03.300.390.400.800.750.100', 'B03.353.500.750.750.100', 'B03.510.100.750.750.100', 'B03.510.400.790.750.100']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33505,[Clinico-immunologic characteristics of acute toxic-allergic reactions to drugs and current methods for their treatment].,"The paper is concerned with clinicoimmunological and allergological characterization of 29 cases of acute toxic allergic reactions (ATAR) to drugs. Four degrees of severity of disease were identified; the most severe form was toxic epidermal necrolysis caused by the use of sulfanilamides and pyrazolones in patients with acute respiratory virus and bacterial infections. Blood analysis in patients with III-IV degree of severity showed a sharp decrease in Ctot and C3 up to 0, an increase in the level of circulating immunocomplexes and ""average molecules"". Cellular immunity in III degree of severity was decreased. The main principles of therapy using extracorporeal immunocorrective methods were worked out.

43021,Undergraduate experience and self-assessed confidence in paediatric dentistry: comparison of three UK dental schools.,"Previous studies have suggested that dental students may not receive sufficient clinical experience in core paediatric dentistry skills. This study aimed to compare dental undergraduates' self-reported experience and confidence in paediatric dentistry within three UK dental schools (Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield). In April/May 2009, 147 final year dental students completed an anonymous questionnaire which captured their experience of seven core clinical skills in both hospital and outreach settings. A visual analogue scale was also employed to record perceived levels of confidence for six generic activities including: examination, diagnosis and treatment planning; patient selection for treatment under general anaesthesia; operative dentistry; preventive dentistry; management of dento-alveolar trauma, and provision of routine care for children on qualification. The key finding was that Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield dental students received comparable clinical experiences in paediatric dentistry, which appeared to satisfy the requirements of the General Dental Council's The first five years. One hundred percent had carried out fissure sealants and restorations, and 87-98% had experience of extractions. Outreach placements were crucial in ensuring students had sufficient opportunity to undertake core skills, notably extractions and pulp therapies. All students reported a lack of confidence in dental trauma management which warrants greater emphasis in the undergraduate curriculum.","['Anesthesia, General', 'Child', 'Clinical Competence', 'Dental Care for Children', 'Dental Restoration, Permanent', 'Dental Service, Hospital', 'Dentistry, Operative', 'Education, Dental', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient Selection', 'Pediatric Dentistry', 'Physical Examination', 'Pit and Fissure Sealants', 'Preceptorship', 'Preventive Dentistry', 'Root Canal Therapy', 'Schools, Dental', 'Self Concept', 'Students, Dental', 'Time Factors', 'Tooth Extraction', 'Tooth Injuries', 'United Kingdom']",20228757,"[['E03.155.197'], ['M01.060.406'], ['I02.399.630.210', 'N04.761.210', 'N05.715.175'], ['E06.170.152', 'N02.421.240.190.215'], ['E06.323.428', 'E06.780.346.737', 'E07.695.190.190'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.298', 'N02.421.240.200', 'N04.452.442.452.422.298'], ['E06.323', 'H02.163.180'], ['I02.358.274'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.590.233.624'], ['E05.581.500.653', 'N04.590.731'], ['H02.163.876.600'], ['E01.370.600'], ['D25.339.773', 'J01.637.051.339.773'], ['I02.358.968'], ['E06.761', 'H02.163.721'], ['E06.397.778'], ['I02.783.495.481'], ['F01.752.747.792'], ['M01.848.769.519'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E04.545.700', 'E06.645.700'], ['C07.793.850', 'C26.900'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
5898,Psoriasin has divergent effects on the innate immune responses of murine glial cells.,"Antimicrobial peptides are an important part of the innate immune defense in the central nervous system (CNS). The expression of the antimicrobial peptides psoriasin (S100A7) is up-regulated during bacterial meningitis. However, the exact mechanisms induced by psoriasin to modulate glial cell activity are not yet fully understood. Our hypothesis is that psoriasin induced pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways as well as regenerative factors to contribute in total to a balanced immune response. Therefore, we used psoriasin-stimulated glial cells and analyzed the translocation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NFêB) in murine glial cells and the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators by real time RT-PCR, ELISA technique, and western blotting. Furthermore, the relationship between psoriasin and the antioxidative stress transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was investigated. Stimulation with psoriasin not only enhanced NFêB translocation and increased the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-á (TNF- á) but also neurotrophin expression. Evidence for functional interactions between psoriasin and Nrf2 were detected in the form of increased antioxidant response element (ARE) activity and induction of Nrf2/ARE-dependent heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression in psoriasin-treated microglia and astrocytes. The results illustrate the ability of psoriasin to induce immunological functions in glia cells where psoriasin exerts divergent effects on the innate immune response.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neuroglia', 'S100 Calcium Binding Protein A7', 'S100 Proteins']",28112393,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['A11.251'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G12.450.564'], ['D23.469'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['A08.637', 'A11.650'], ['D12.776.157.125.750.563'], ['D12.776.157.125.750', 'D12.776.631.655']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
38356,A new method of magnifying photographic images using the scanning electron microscope in the backscattered electron detection mode.,"This paper describes a new method of magnifying small images in photographic film by means of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated in the backscattered electron detection mode. The study included tests of several types of radiographic film, transmission electron microscopy film, and black and white 35 mm film. The electron optical enlargement method is particularly useful in situations where the film sample is opaque to light and for generating enlarged images at magnifications beyond the reach of light optical enlargement methods, i.e. up to approximately 2000X with ease and rapidity in a single step. The electron optical enlargements compare favorably in contrast and detail with the enlargements made with a light microscope and with a darkroom enlarger.","['Breast Diseases', 'Calcinosis', 'Electrons', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'X-Ray Film']",7170609,"[['C17.800.090'], ['C18.452.174.130'], ['G01.249.335', 'G01.358.500.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['E05.196.822', 'G01.867'], ['E07.960']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
40774,Assessment of three dimensional bone augmentation of severely atrophied maxillary alveolar ridges using prebent titanium mesh vs customized poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) mesh: A randomized clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Alveolar bone grafting techniques and dental rehabilitation of patients with maxillary alveolar defects is a very challenging and costly procedure. Various methods have been described to reconstruct these defects in order to facilitate the placement of dental implants. The aim of this study was to assess three dimensional (3D) maxillary ridge augmentation using two innovative, accurate, and time saving protocols.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients (32 implants) with vertically and horizontally deficient maxillary alveolar ridges, were equally allocated into 2 groups; a mix of particulate autogenous and xenogenic bone grafts loaded in a prebent titanium mesh (Control group) vs patient specific poly-ether-ether ketone meshes (Study group). Radiographic assessment was performed preoperatively, 1 week and 6 months postoperatively. Assessment included measurements of linear changes in the vertical and horizontal dimensions on cross sectional cuts of cone beam computed tomography using special software. Finally; the percentage of 3D bone gain in each group was compared to that of the other.RESULTS: Wound healing was uneventful for all cases except one patient in each group were the meshes were exposed 2 weeks' postsurgery. There was no statistical significance between both groups (P value = 0.2).CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the sample size of this study, both techniques could be used as a successful method of ridge augmentation with no statistical significance between them.","['Alveolar Process', 'Alveolar Ridge Augmentation', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dental Implantation, Endosseous', 'Ether', 'Ethers', 'Humans', 'Ketones', 'Maxilla', 'Surgical Mesh', 'Titanium']",30895678,"[['A02.835.232.781.324.502.125', 'A14.521.125', 'A14.549.167.646.094'], ['E04.545.550.100', 'E06.645.550.100'], ['E02.095.147.725.052', 'E04.555.130', 'E04.936.580.052'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['E04.545.550.280.280', 'E04.650.230.500', 'E06.645.550.280.280', 'E06.780.314.310'], ['D02.355.417.332'], ['D02.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.522'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.502.645', 'A14.521.645'], ['E07.858.708'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
44724,Restricted transcription from sigma H or phosphorylated spo0A dependent promoters in the temperature-sensitive secA341 mutant of Bacillus subtilis.,"The temperature-sensitive secA341 mutation of Bacillus subtilis affects sporulation and sporulation-associated events as well as protein secretion and cell septation. With lacZ or bgaB fusion genes, we examined the expression of the early sporulation genes in the mutant strain. Transcriptional expression of delta H dependent kinA, spo0A (Ps), phrC, spoVG, and citG (p2) genes was blocked by the secA341 mutation at 37 degrees C. On the other hand, neither repression of the abrB gene nor induction of the spoH (delta H) gene was affected. Active RNA polymerase containing delta H was, however, found to be produced in the mutant cells. Expression of the phosphorylated Spo0A dependent spoIIG operon was also blocked. Thus the secA341 mutation blocks some step(s) or factor(s) required for delta H-dependent transcription in vivo.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Bacillus subtilis', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'SEC Translocation Channels', 'SecA Proteins', 'Sigma Factor', 'Temperature', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",9805371,"[['D08.811.277.040.025'], ['B03.300.390.400.158.218.725', 'B03.353.500.100.218.725', 'B03.510.100.100.218.725', 'B03.510.415.400.158.218.725', 'B03.510.460.410.158.218.725'], ['D12.776.097'], ['D12.776.097.275'], ['G05.308.300'], ['D12.776.157.530', 'D12.776.543.585'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D05.500.890.625', 'D12.776.157.530.875', 'D12.776.543.585.875'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.494'], ['D12.776.930.800'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['D12.776.930'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
41869,Personality dimensions of haemodialysis patients related to initial renal disease.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate personality dimensions in uraemic patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD. The relationship between the disease that led to renal failure (and the subsequent need for haemodialysis) and the personality of the haemodialysis patients in question were investigated.METHODS: In the present study, which was conducted in three Greek hospitals, 103 patients were analysed and compared to 138 control patients matching the groups according to their age, sex and place of residence. The investigation was conducted using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), a reliable method for clinical studies that measures three dimensions of personality: neuroticism, psychoticism and introverted/extroverted.RESULTS: The results from the EPQ were compared to the three disease categories that cause renal failure: glomerulonephritis, polycystic disease, and vascular disease. It was concluded that haemodialysis systematically affected all three scales of personality disorders in the patients. Male patients scored higher in neuroticism, while female patients appeared to score higher in psychoticism. Renal disease, the responsible factor for renal failure and the need for haemodialysis, significantly affected personality disorders.CONCLUSION: The findings show that dialysis modality influences the personalities of patients, and that initial renal disease must be strongly considered in the psychosocial evaluation and care of these patients.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Greece', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Personality', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Vascular Diseases']",12035897,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C12.777.419.570.363', 'C13.351.968.419.570.363'], ['Z01.542.383'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.777.419.780.750.500', 'C13.351.968.419.780.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.752'], ['C12.777.419.403.875', 'C13.351.968.419.403.875', 'C16.131.077.717', 'C16.320.184.625'], ['E02.870.300', 'E02.912.800'], ['C14.907']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
8811,Inactivated Lactobacillus plantarum,"Vaccination is considered the most effective strategy for controlling tuberculosis (TB). The existing vaccine, the Bacille Calmette-Gu?rin (BCG), although partially protective, has a number of limitations. Therefore, there is a need for developing new TB vaccines and several strategies are currently exploited including the use of viral and bacterial delivery vectors. We have previously shown that Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) producing Ag85B and ESAT-6 antigens fused to a dendritic cell-targeting peptide (referred to as Lp_DC) induced specific immune responses in mice. Here, we analyzed the ability of two Lp-based vaccines, Lp_DC and Lp_HBD (in which the DC-binding peptide was replaced by an HBD-domain directing the antigen to non-phagocytic cells) to activate antigen-presenting cells, induce specific immunity and protect mice from Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We tested two strategies: (i) Lp as BCG boosting vaccine (a heterologous regimen comprising parenteral BCG immunization followed by intranasal Lp boost), and (ii) Lp as primary vaccine (a homologous regimen including subcutaneous priming followed by intranasal boost). The results showed that both Lp constructs applied as a BCG boost induced specific cellular immunity, manifested in T cell proliferation, antigen-specific IFN-ã responses and multifunctional T cells phenotypes. More importantly, intranasal boost with Lp_DC or Lp_HBD enhanced protection offered by BCG, as shown by reduced M. tuberculosis counts in lungs. These findings suggest that Lp constructs could be developed as a potential mucosal vaccine platform against mycobacterial infections.","['Animals', 'Antigens, Bacterial', 'BCG Vaccine', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunization, Secondary', 'Lactobacillus plantarum', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tuberculosis', 'Tuberculosis Vaccines', 'Vaccination']",31354727,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.050.161'], ['D20.215.894.135.825.100'], ['D12.776.097'], ['A11.251'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G12.450.050.400'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.485', 'E05.478.550.550'], ['B03.353.750.450.475.612', 'B03.510.460.400.410.475.475.612', 'B03.510.550.450.475.612'], ['A11.118.637.555', 'A15.145.229.637.555', 'A15.382.490.555'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B03.510.024.962.500.702', 'B03.510.460.400.410.552.552.702'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846'], ['D20.215.894.135.825'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.530.890', 'E05.478.550.600.890', 'N02.421.726.758.310.890', 'N06.850.780.200.425.900', 'N06.850.780.680.310.890']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

2353,[The Neuro-Mental Index. An addition to the Barthel Index for detection of impairments in basic psychological-mental diemsnions in neurorehabilitation].,"The Barthel Index (BI) is the most commonly used scale for assessing impairment of activities of daily living (ADL). For a global view of patients' abilities and the care needed in everyday neurorehabilitation practice, additional information about basic psychological and cognitive functions is essential. We therefore designed a new disability scale comprised of assessments of consciousness, approachability, orientation, memory, behaviour, emotions, communication, problem solving, perception, and behaviour at night. The scale shows exactly the same inner structure as the BI, with ten items and a score of up to 20 in steps from 0-100% (or 0-20 points). By a careful weighing of the items, the final score of the neuromental index (NMI) should create a clearer picture of both the disabilities and the needed resources. A second aim was to cover a broad range of patients including those in coma and coma remission states and those with only slight neuropsychological or behavioural symptoms. The NMI was examined with a group of 179 neurorehabilitation inpatients and proved to be highly valid, reliable, and practicable. It was designed to enable a global assessment of disability as well as the care resources needed, even in patients with different disability levels in ADL and psychological and cognitive functions.","['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Psychometrics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",11139992,"[['E02.760.169.063.500.067', 'E02.831.067', 'I03.050', 'N02.421.784.110'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['F03.615.250'], ['E01.370.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C10'], ['F04.711.513'], ['F04.711.780'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
10837,Intravenous immunoglobulin increases survival time in the acute phase of experimental Chagas disease.,"Chagas disease induced by Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc) infection is an important cause of mortality and morbidity affecting the cardiovascular system for which presently available therapies are insufficient and largely inadequate. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a therapeutic preparation containing normal polyspecific IgG obtained from plasma pools of several thousand healthy donors and is used in several autoimmune, inflammatory and infectious diseases. In the study of heart from mice chronically infected with Tc, we observed that IVIg restores type 1 atrioventricular block or bradycardia. In the present study, we investigated the effects of IVIg in acute Tc infection. Intravenous immunoglobulin administration after the first week of infection was associated with an increase in survival time. Taken together, results observed in the chronic and in the acute phase associate IVIg treatment with a favourable outcome in T. cruzi infection.","['Animals', 'Chagas Disease', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",20500678,"[['B01.050'], ['C01.610.752.300.900.200', 'C01.920.625'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393.536', 'D12.776.124.486.485.114.632', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.632', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.632'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1658,The electronic Psoriasis and Arthritis Screening Questionnaire (ePASQ): a sensitive and specific tool to diagnose psoriatic arthritis patients.,"BACKGROUND: We report on an electronic version of the Psoriatic Arthritis Screening Questionnaire (ePASQ), a sensitive and specific tool for diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in patients with plaque psoriasis.OBJECTIVE: To validate the ePASQ against the original paper version.METHOD: The ePASQ scores 15 points on 10 weighted questions and a 68-joint diagram. Data were collected from a prospective cohort of 42 patients with early PsA meeting the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria and from 12 plaque psoriasis patients without PsA.RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristic curves for the ePASQ group yielded an optimal 97.62% sensitivity and 75.00% specificity, for a cutoff score of 7. A cutoff point of 8 yielded 88.10% sensitivity and 75.00% specificity. Concordance of the paper and electronic scores was very high.CONCLUSION: The ePASQ is a sensitive and specific tool to screen for PsA. The simple electronic administration and automatic scoring minimize clinician involvement and increase the potential for wider distribution.","['Adult', 'Arthritis, Psoriatic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'ROC Curve', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",21561582,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C05.116.900.853.625.800.424', 'C05.550.114.145', 'C05.550.114.865.800.424', 'C17.800.859.675.175'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.500', 'E05.318.308.980.438.580', 'N02.421.726.233.443', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.580', 'N06.850.780.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.370.800.750', 'E05.318.740.872.750', 'N05.715.360.325.700.680', 'N06.850.520.445.800.750'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
27005,Hemispheric lateralization and language skill coherence in temporal lobe epilepsy.,"Patients with an early onset of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are at an increased risk for language reorganization. It is unknown whether this reorganization involves a full shift of all language skills to the contralateral hemisphere, or whether it can be partial and involve only a subset of language skills. In this study we report dominance concordance patterns for five separate language skills measured during the Intracarotid Amobarbital Procedure (IAP) for 124 TLE patients. We examined whether the language skills show similar or independent lateralization patterns. We compare these patterns in early versus late seizure onset groups with either a left or right temporal lobe seizure focus. The data showed that the rates of atypical representation ranged from 25.8% for reading to 14.5% of the sample for speech. A majority of patients (60%) showing atypical language representation do so on more than one skill. While multiple atypicalities were common, the proportion of patients showing atypical representation on all five skills was strikingly low (5.6% of the total sample). Our data suggest that language systems are not independent and do not shift and reorganize in isolation, and no pairs of skills seem more likely to reorganize than others. There was also evidence that language is not monolithic with all language skills reorganizing together. The latter suggests that the pressures compelling atypical representation may not work equally on all language skills.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amobarbital', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe', 'Female', 'Functional Laterality', 'Humans', 'Language Tests', 'Male', 'Mental Recall', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Reading', 'Recognition, Psychology', 'Speech Perception', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual Fields']",19286172,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D03.383.742.698.253.077'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['C10.228.140.490.360.290', 'C10.228.140.490.493.375'], ['F02.830.297.425', 'G11.561.225.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.711.513.240'], ['F02.463.425.540.641'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G11.561.638'], ['L01.559.423.557'], ['F02.463.425.540.706'], ['F02.463.593.071.875', 'G07.888.125.875'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.863'], ['F01.145.209.908'], ['F02.463.593.932.934', 'G14.950']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
41606,Development of Optic Disc Torsion in Children.,"PURPOSE: To document the development of disc torsion.METHODS: Consecutive disc photographs obtained at an interval of at least 1 year were reviewed retrospectively in 173 eyes of 173 Korean children. The angle of the vertical disc axis (AVDA) was measured in each fundus photograph with the fovea-disc center axis set at 0°. The associated change in the morphology of the optic disc was assessed by measuring the ratio of the horizontal to vertical disc diameters and the ratio of the maximum parapapillary atrophy width to vertical disc diameter. Eyes were divided into two groups with respect to the development of disc torsion: torsion and non-torsion group. Progressive torsion was defined as a change in AVDA between baseline and follow-up photographs beyond the coefficient of intraobserver repeatab ility. Factors associated with optic disc torsion were evaluated using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Mean subject age and refractive error at the time of baseline fundus examination were 6.8 ± 1.7 (range, 2 to 11) years and 0.2 ± 2.6 (range, -6.0 to +5.5) diopters, respectively. Mean follow-up period was 44.8 ± 21.1 (range, 12 to 103) months. Forty-two eyes (24%) were classified as torsion group who showed changes in AVDA that were greater than the intraobserver measurement variability (4.5°) during the follow-up period. The development of optic disc torsion was associated with greater myopic shift, a decrease in horizontal to vertical disc diameters, and an increase in parapapillary atrophy width to vertical disc diameter.CONCLUSIONS: Progressive optic disc torsion was a common phenomenon in the children included in this study. Torsion occurred as the result of optic disc tilt in an oblique axis in most cases. The findings provide a framework for understanding torsion-related glaucomatous optic nerve damage.","['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve Diseases', 'ROC Curve', 'Refraction, Ocular', 'Refractive Errors', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, Optical Coherence', 'Torsion Abnormality', 'Visual Field Tests']",30977327,"[['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A08.800.800.120.680.660', 'A09.371.729.690'], ['C10.292.700', 'C11.640'], ['E05.318.370.800.750', 'E05.318.740.872.750', 'N05.715.360.325.700.680', 'N06.850.520.445.800.750'], ['E01.370.380.850.700', 'G01.590.775', 'G14.760'], ['C11.744'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.370.350.589.249.500', 'E01.370.350.825.805.500', 'E05.642.249.500'], ['C23.300.970'], ['E01.370.380.850.962']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
7242,"Post-DSAEK optical changes: a comprehensive prospective analysis on the role of ocular wavefront aberrations, haze, and corneal thickness.","PURPOSE: The aim was to assess the visual impact of ocular wavefront aberrations, corneal thickness, and corneal light scatter prospectively after performing a Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) in humans.METHODS: Data were obtained prospectively from 20 eyes preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-DSAEK. At each visit, the best spectacle-corrected visual acuity and visual acuity with glare (brightness acuity testing) were recorded, and ocular wavefront measurements and corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed. The magnitude and the sign of individual Zernike terms [higher-order aberrations (HOAs)] were determined. Epithelial, host stromal, donor stromal, and total corneal thicknesses were quantified. The brightness and intensity profiles of OCT images were generated to quantify light scatter in the whole cornea, subepithelial region, anterior and posterior host stroma, interface, and donor stroma.RESULTS: The mean best spectacle-corrected visual acuity and glare disability at low light levels improved from 1 to 12 months post-DSAEK. All corneal thicknesses and ocular lower-order aberrations and HOAs were found to be stable from 1 to 12 months, whereas total corneal, host stromal, and interface brightness intensities decreased significantly over the same period. A repeated measures analysis of variance performed across the follow-up period revealed that the change in scatter, but not the change in the HOAs, could account for the variability occurring in the acuity from 1 to 12 months post-DSAEK.CONCLUSIONS: Although ocular HOAs and scatter are both elevated over normal values post-DSAEK, our results demonstrate that the improvements in visual performance occurring over the first year post-DSAEK are associated with decreasing light scatter. In contrast, there were no significant changes in the ocular HOAs during this time. Because corneal light scatter decreased between 1 and 12 months despite there being stable corneal thicknesses over the same period, we conclude that factors that induced light scatter, other than tissue thickness or swelling (corneal edema), significantly impacted the visual improvements that occurred over time post-DSAEK. A better understanding of the cellular and extracellular matrix changes of the subepithelial region and interface, incurred by the surgical creation of a lamellar host-graft interface, and the subsequent healing of these tissues, is warranted.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Corneal Topography', 'Corneal Wavefront Aberration', 'Descemet Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty', 'Female', 'Glare', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pseudophakia', 'Tomography, Optical Coherence', 'Visual Acuity']",24162748,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['E01.370.380.150'], ['C11.204.431', 'C11.744.345'], ['E02.095.147.725.262', 'E04.540.825.374.112', 'E04.936.580.262'], ['G01.590.540.333', 'G14.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['C23.888.681'], ['E01.370.350.589.249.500', 'E01.370.350.825.805.500', 'E05.642.249.500'], ['E01.370.380.850.950', 'F02.463.593.932.901', 'G14.940']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
25142,"Life events, psychosocial factors, and demographic variables in early rheumatoid arthritis: relations to one-year changes in functional disability.","OBJECTIVE: To explore how life events, psychosocial factors, and demographic variables are related to one-year changes in disability in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).METHODS: A sample of 238 patients with RA of 48 mo duration or less was examined at baseline and after 12 mo (n = 227; 95%). Data on life events and psychosocial variables were collected by structured interviews, and functional disability was measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Analyses of variance and forward stepwise linear regression analyses were used as statistical procedures.RESULTS: Mean functional disability measured by the HAQ was relatively low at baseline and remained stable during one year. Positive life events experienced during the past year were significantly related to improved physical ability, whereas female sex was significantly related to reduction in ability. Neither age, income, education, number of network members, symptoms of mental distress, nor negative life events in the past year significantly predicted one-year changes in functional limitations.CONCLUSION: The experience of positive life events during the past year was significantly related to a reduction in disability in this prospective study of 238 patients with early RA. This finding adds to our knowledge regarding the relationship between psychosocial factors and disease progression in RA.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid', 'Demography', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",8835552,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['C05.550.114.154', 'C05.799.114', 'C17.300.775.099', 'C20.111.199'], ['I01.240', 'N01.224', 'N06.850.505.400'], ['E01.370.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.458.410'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
33561,Experiences of partners of prostate cancer survivors: A qualitative study.,"Prostate cancer, Australia's leading cancer, has treatment side effects that reduce the quality of life for both survivors and partners. Limited partner research exists. This study aimed to address this gap in the literature by gathering data directly from partners to obtain a deeper understanding of their experiences of prostate cancer survivorship that helps inform healthcare service providers. A qualitative approach was taken to explore participant views (N = 16) through three focus groups and two in-depth interviews. Five themes emerged relating to caregiver burden, knowledge deficit, isolation, changes of sexual relations, and unmet needs. Possible implications for practice may include the need for specific partner-related information and interventions to assist couples to cope with the emotional distress caused by treatment side effects.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Australia', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Life', 'Sexual Partners']",28506193,"[['F01.058'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['Z01.639.100', 'Z01.678.100.373'], ['M01.860.350'], ['E05.318.308.112', 'N05.715.360.300.269', 'N06.850.520.308.112'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.588.945.440.770', 'C12.294.260.750', 'C12.294.565.625', 'C12.758.409.750'], ['H01.770.644.241.850'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['M01.778']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
43463,The influence of communicator weight on psychoeducational message acceptance in females with high vs. low levels of body image disturbance.,"Researchers have yet to examine the effect of the communicator's weight status on participants' responses to an eating disorder or body dissatisfaction prevention program. It is plausible that participants may be reactive to the weight of the communicator (e.g., therapist), which might adversely affect acceptance of the message contained in the program. In the current study, 217 college females were randomly assigned to three communicator weight conditions (underweight, average weight, and overweight). Participants in each group were subdivided by trait body dissatisfaction level, based on a median split. The procedure involved the implementation of a well-established psychoeducational intervention designed to decrease endorsement of the thin-ideal. Results supported the overall efficacy of the intervention but indicated a minimal effect for participant's trait dissatisfaction level and communicator weight status on a variety of outcome measures. Limitations of the current study are provided, as well as recommendations for future research.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Attitude', 'Body Image', 'Body Weight', 'Counseling', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders', 'Female', 'Health Education', 'Humans', 'Job Application', 'Prejudice', 'Students', 'Treatment Outcome', 'User-Computer Interface']",15854871,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F01.100'], ['F01.752.747.792.110', 'F02.463.593.112'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['F02.784.176', 'F04.408.413', 'N02.421.143.303', 'N02.421.461.363'], ['F03.400'], ['I02.233.332', 'N02.421.726.407'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.452.677.400'], ['F01.145.813.550', 'F01.829.595'], ['M01.848'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['L01.224.900.910']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0

There should be an experience and proficiency in the techniques from the optimal application and use of invasive methods including direct arterial puncture and recording of arterial blood pressure, and the use of the Swan-Ganz catheter systems. This must be reinforced by continuous educational experiences and updating with the newer techiniques as they become available. All personnel concerned must have a knowledge of and respect for the complications inherent in any invasive procedure, particularly involving the vascular system.

12875,Ordered conformational changes in damaged DNA induced by nucleotide excision repair factors.,"In response to genotoxic attacks, cells activate sophisticated DNA repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair (NER), which consists of damage removal via dual incision and DNA resynthesis. Using permanganate footprinting as well as highly purified factors, we show that NER is a dynamic process that takes place in a number of successive steps during which the DNA is remodeled around the lesion in response to the various NER factors. XPC/HR23B first recognizes the damaged structure and initiates the opening of the helix from position -3 to +6. TFIIH is then recruited and, in the presence of ATP, extends the opening from position -6 to +6; it also displaces XPC downstream from the lesion, thereby providing the topological structure for recruiting XPA and RPA, which will enlarge the opening. Once targeted by XPG, the damaged DNA is further melted from position -19 to +8. XPG and XPF/ERCC1 endonucleases then cut the damaged DNA at the limit of the opened structure that was previously ""labeled"" by the positioning of XPC/HR23B and TFIIH.","['Adenosine Triphosphate', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Enzymes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Endonucleases', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Replication Protein A', 'Transcription Factor TFIIH', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors, TFII', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group A Protein']",14981083,"[['D03.633.100.759.646.138.236', 'D13.695.667.138.236', 'D13.695.827.068.236'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G05.200'], ['G02.111.222', 'G05.219'], ['D08.811.074'], ['D12.776.260'], ['D08.811.277.352.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.660'], ['G02.111.570.820.486', 'G05.360.580'], ['D12.776.260.700'], ['D12.776.260.775.875.875', 'D12.776.930.930.875.875'], ['D12.776.930'], ['D12.776.260.775.875', 'D12.776.930.930.875'], ['D12.776.157.687.875', 'D12.776.260.975', 'D12.776.660.720.875']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
12,Dysbiosis of the Gut Microbiome is associated with Tumor Biomarkers in Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer is a malignancy with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. More evidences indicated that gut microbiome plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and progression of cancers by metabolism, inflammation and immune response. However, the study about the characterizations of gut microbiome in lung cancer is limited. In this study, the fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 30 lung cancer patients who were divided into 3 groups based on different tumor biomarkers (cytokeratin 19 fragment, neuron specific enolase and carcinoembryonic antigen, respectively) and were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Each lung cancer group has characterized gut microbial community and presents an elimination, low-density, and loss of bacterial diversity microbial ecosystem compared to that of the healthy control. The microbiome structures in family and genera levels are more complex and significantly varied from each group presenting more different and special pathogen microbiome such as Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus, Prevotella, etc and fewer probiotic genera including Blautia, Coprococcus, Bifidobacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and COG annotation demonstrated decreased abundance of some dominant metabolism-related pathways in the lung cancer. This study explores for the first time the features of gut microbiome in lung cancer patients and may provide new insight into the pathogenesis of lung cancer system, with the implication that gut microbiota may serve as a microbial marker and contribute to the derived metabolites, development and differentiation in lung cancer system.","['Aged', 'Bacteria', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Dysbiosis', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S']",31595156,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['B03'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C23.550.308'], ['A12.459'], ['G06.591.375', 'G16.500.275.157.049.100.500.375', 'N06.230.124.049.100.500.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D13.444.735.686.670']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Most recently, reduced expression of C/EBPá and growth inhibitory effect was found in primary mammary carcinomas. However, the underlying mechanism is still not fully aware. Here, we firstly identified miR-134 as a target of C/EBPá in MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. C/EBPá overexpression promoted miR-134 expression, causing suppression of apoptosis- protective genes CREB and Bcl-2, and resulted in the proliferation inhibition of MCF7 cells. Moreover, anti-miR-134 rescued the proliferation inhibition of MCF7 cells and the suppression of anti-apoptotic genes CREB and Bcl-2 caused by C/EBPá overexpression. Collectively, C/EBPá inhibited cell growth in breast cancer cells via a novel pathway miR-134/CREB.","['Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'MicroRNAs', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",26823765,"[['G04.146.954.035'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['D12.776.260.108.124', 'D12.776.660.167', 'D12.776.930.127.124'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['D12.776.260.108.184', 'D12.776.930.127.184'], ['G05.308.370'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.251.210.190.630'], ['D13.150.650.319', 'D13.444.735.150.319', 'D13.444.735.790.552.500'], ['D12.644.360.075.718', 'D12.776.476.075.718', 'D12.776.624.664.700.169'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4259,Mortality and complications in very old patients (90+) admitted to departments of internal medicine in Spain.,"SUMMARY: Patients over 90 years of age (the ""very elderly"") account for an increasing number of admissions to departments of internal medicine (IM). The aim of this study was to analyse the demographic data, hospitalization characteristics, medical complications, and predictors of mortality in patients over 90 admitted to IM departments.MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients admitted to IM departments in Spain between the years 2005 and 2007 were analysed. Clinical and demographic data were compared with records from ""younger elderly"" patients (65-90).RESULTS: During the study period, there were 1,567,659 patient admissions to IM departments in Spain, and 90,679 (5.8%) were older than 90. Hospital mortality occurred in 22.3% of very elderly patients. The main predictors for hospital death were pressure ulcer (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.55, CI95% 1.45-1.66), thromboembolic disease (OR 1.83, CI95% 1.61-2.09), nosocomial pneumonia (OR 2.53, CI95% 2.39-2.69), hip fracture (OR 2.20, CI95% 1.53-3.18), male gender (OR 1.06, CI95% 1.03-1.10), age (OR 1.05, CI95% 1.04-1.06), dementia (OR 1.13, CI95% 1.08-1.18), cancer (OR 1.60, CI95% 1.51-1.71), acute respiratory failure (OR 1.83, CI95% 1.76-1.89), acute infectious disease (OR 2.30, IC95% 2.11-2.52), and Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.21, CI95% 1.16-1.26).CONCLUSIONS: Very elderly patients represent a large and growing fraction of the total admissions to IM departments in Spain. They are at higher risk for complications during their hospital stay and mortality rate is double that of the younger elderly.","['Age Distribution', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cross Infection', 'Dementia', 'Female', 'Hip Fractures', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Inpatients', 'Internal Medicine', 'Male', 'Neoplasms', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Admission', 'Patient Discharge', 'Pressure Ulcer', 'Respiratory Insufficiency', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Spain', 'Thromboembolism']",21238893,"[['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C01.221', 'C23.550.291.531'], ['C01.248', 'C23.550.291.875.500'], ['C10.228.140.380', 'F03.615.400'], ['C26.404.061.425', 'C26.531.750', 'C26.558.276.425'], ['N02.278.216.500.968', 'N04.452.442.452.422'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.400', 'N01.224.935.698.400', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.400', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.643.470'], ['H02.403.429'], ['C04'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['E02.760.400.600', 'N02.421.585.400.600'], ['E02.760.169.125', 'E02.760.400.610', 'N02.421.585.169.125', 'N02.421.585.400.610', 'N04.590.233.727.210.125'], ['C17.800.893.665'], ['C08.618.846'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['I01.240.800', 'N01.224.803', 'N06.850.505.400.850'], ['Z01.542.846'], ['C14.907.355.590']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

28939,Epidermal growth factor receptor defects in leprechaunism. A multiple growth factor-resistant syndrome.,"Leprechaunism is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe growth retardation and insulin resistance. Maximal epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding was reduced in fibroblasts from three unrelated patients with leprechaunism (Ark-1, Can-1, and Minn-1) compared with control (0.8-2.2%/mg protein vs. 5.5%/mg protein). This was due to a decrease in receptor affinity in Ark-1 and Can-1 and a decrease in receptor number in Minn-1. In all cell lines, EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation was also decreased to 18-60% of control, whereas EGF internalization and degradation was normal. Sphingosine (40 microM), a protein kinase C inhibitor, increased EGF receptor affinity twofold in control cells and six- to nine-fold in cells of leprechaunism. However, sphingosine did not enhance EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation in either the controls or the patients' cells. By contrast, only one of the three cell lines of patients with the type A syndrome demonstrated a decrease in EGF binding and all demonstrated normal or near normal EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. These data indicate that in patients with leprechaunism, there are functional abnormalities of the EGF receptor, as well as of the insulin receptor, that may contribute to the severity of the syndrome. These data also suggest a role for the insulin receptor in maintaining normal EGF receptor function in these cells.","['Drug Resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Fibroblasts', 'Growth Disorders', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Receptor, Insulin', 'Sphingosine']",2808704,"[['G07.690.773.984'], ['D06.472.317.350', 'D12.644.276.382.500', 'D12.776.467.382.500', 'D23.529.382.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074'], ['A11.329.228'], ['C23.550.393'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452.394.968.500', 'G07.690.773.984.617'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.200', 'D12.776.543.750.630.484', 'D12.776.543.750.750.580.300'], ['D02.033.100.700', 'D02.033.455.843', 'D02.092.063.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the present study, it is assumed that there is a relationship between moral stress, support and competence for nurses in intensive care units.AIM: To analyse and describe the theoretical relationship between moral stress and support on the one hand and competence on the other, in the context of intensive care.METHOD: A form of qualitative secondary analysis based on the findings from three original studies. In the analytic process a theory on professional competence was used.FINDINGS: The findings suggest that imbalance due to moral stress between different competences hinders the development of collectively shared caring competence.CONCLUSIONS: Moral stress cannot be totally eliminated in the intensive care unit. But moral stress is not only a problem. It can also become a driving force to stimulate competence.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Burnout, Professional', 'Clinical Competence', 'Conflict, Psychological', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Critical Care', 'Decision Making', 'Empathy', 'Ethical Theory', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Interprofessional Relations', 'Morals', 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Nursing Staff, Hospital', 'Nursing Theory', 'Psychological Theory', 'Qualitative Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Sweden']",17456175,"[['F01.058'], ['F01.100.050', 'N05.300.100'], ['C24.580.500', 'F01.145.126.990.367.500', 'F02.830.900.333.500'], ['I02.399.630.210', 'N04.761.210', 'N05.715.175'], ['F01.658.209'], ['F01.145.813.115'], ['E02.760.190', 'N02.421.585.190'], ['F02.463.785.373'], ['F01.752.355', 'F01.752.543.500.500'], ['K01.752.566.479.118', 'N05.350.256'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.401.205'], ['F01.829.500', 'K01.752.566'], ['H01.770.644.145.390.634', 'H02.478.395.634', 'N04.590.233.508.613.634'], ['M01.526.485.680.490', 'M01.526.485.740.523', 'N02.360.680.490', 'N02.360.740.523'], ['H02.478.408'], ['F02.739'], ['H01.770.644.241.850'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.752.747.792.700'], ['I01.880.853.500.600'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['Z01.542.816.500']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
1403,Neurotrophins elevate cAMP to reach a threshold required to overcome inhibition by MAG through extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent inhibition of phosphodiesterase.,"Inhibitors of regeneration in myelin, such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), play an important role in preventing regeneration after CNS injury. Elevation of cAMP, either with dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) or by priming with a variety of neurotrophins, overcomes inhibition by MAG and myelin. However, activation of cAMP is not generally regarded as a signaling pathway for neurotrophins. Here we show that the NGF-like neurotrophins overcome inhibition by MAG by activating tyrosine kinase receptors. We also show that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) by BDNF is required to overcome inhibition by MAG, and that activated Erk transiently inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), the enzyme that hydrolyzes cAMP. Inhibition of PDE4 then allows cAMP to increase and so initiates the pathway to overcome inhibition. Furthermore, we also show that basal levels of Erk activation and basal cAMP levels contribute to the effects of db-cAMP by pushing the combined levels of cAMP above a threshold required to overcome inhibition. Together, these results not only show how NGF-like neurotrophins can elevate cAMP and overcome inhibition but also point to a novel mechanism of cross talk in neurons from the Erk to the cAMP signaling pathways.","[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases"", 'Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Bucladesine', 'CHO Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Mutation', 'Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein', 'Nerve Growth Factor', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Neurons', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor', 'Signal Transduction']",14684879,"[['D08.811.277.352.640.150', 'D12.644.360.008', 'D12.776.476.008'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.644.276.860.100', 'D12.776.467.860.100', 'D12.776.631.600.100', 'D23.529.850.100'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395.250', 'D13.695.462.200.250', 'D13.695.667.138.395.250', 'D13.695.827.068.395.250'], ['A11.251.210.200', 'A11.436.155'], ['A11.251'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['D08.811.277.352.640.150.400', 'D12.644.360.008.400', 'D12.776.476.008.400'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.565', 'D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.200', 'D12.644.360.440', 'D12.776.476.440'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567', 'D12.644.360.450', 'D12.776.476.450'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D12.776.395.550.570', 'D12.776.503.921.049', 'D12.776.543.550.555', 'D12.776.543.620.530', 'D12.776.631.580.500'], ['D12.644.276.860.437', 'D12.776.467.860.437', 'D12.776.631.600.437', 'D23.529.850.437'], ['D12.644.276.860', 'D12.776.467.860', 'D12.776.631.600', 'D23.529.850'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D27.505.519.389.735'], ['D12.776.543.750.750.400.550'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

44617,"Unique amino acid signatures that are evolutionarily conserved distinguish simple-type, epidermal and hair keratins.","Keratins (Ks) consist of central á-helical rod domains that are flanked by non-á-helical head and tail domains. The cellular abundance of keratins, coupled with their selective cell expression patterns, suggests that they diversified to fulfill tissue-specific functions although the primary structure differences between them have not been comprehensively compared. We analyzed keratin sequences from many species: K1, K2, K5, K9, K10, K14 were studied as representatives of epidermal keratins, and compared with K7, K8, K18, K19, K20 and K31, K35, K81, K85, K86, which represent simple-type (single-layered or glandular) epithelial and hair keratins, respectively. We show that keratin domains have striking differences in their amino acids. There are many cysteines in hair keratins but only a small number in epidermal keratins and rare or none in simple-type keratins. The heads and/or tails of epidermal keratins are glycine and phenylalanine rich but alanine poor, whereas parallel domains of hair keratins are abundant in prolines, and those of simple-type epithelial keratins are enriched in acidic and/or basic residues. The observed differences between simple-type, epidermal and hair keratins are highly conserved throughout evolution. Cysteines and histidines, which are infrequent keratin amino acids, are involved in de novo mutations that are markedly overrepresented in keratins. Hence, keratins have evolutionarily conserved and domain-selectively enriched amino acids including glycine and phenylalanine (epidermal), cysteine and proline (hair), and basic and acidic (simple-type epithelial), which reflect unique functions related to structural flexibility, rigidity and solubility, respectively. Our findings also support the importance of human keratin 'mutation hotspot' residues and their wild-type counterparts.","['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Epidermis', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Keratins', 'Keratins, Hair-Specific', 'Mice', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein']",22215855,"[['D12.125'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A10.272.497', 'A17.815.250'], ['G05.045.250', 'G16.075.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D05.750.078.593.450', 'D12.776.220.475.450', 'D12.776.860.607'], ['D05.750.078.593.450.149', 'D12.776.220.475.450.149', 'D12.776.860.607.149'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['E05.393.760.705']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41075,"Uni- and triaxial accelerometric signals agree during daily routine, but show differences between sports.","Accelerometers objectively monitor physical activity, and ongoing research suggests they can also detect patterns of body movement. However, different types of signal (uniaxial, captured by older studies, vs. the newer triaxial) and or/device (validated Actigraph used by older studies, vs. others) may lead to incomparability of results from different time periods. Standardization is desirable. We establish whether uniaxial signals adequately monitor routine activity, and whether triaxial accelerometry can detect sport-specific variations in movement pattern. 1402 adolescents wore triaxial Actigraphs (GT3X) for one week and diaried sport. Uni- and triaxial counts per minute were compared across the week and between over 30 different sports. Across the whole recording period 95% of variance in triaxial counts was explained by the vertical axis (5th percentile for R2, 91%). Sport made up a small fraction of daily routine, but differences were visible: even when total acceleration was comparable, little was vertical in horizontal movements, such as ice skating (uniaxial counts 41% of triaxial) compared to complex movements (taekwondo, 55%) or ambulation (soccer, 69%). Triaxial accelerometry captured differences in movement pattern between sports, but so little time was spent in sport that, across the whole day, uni- and triaxial signals correlated closely. This indicates that, with certain limitations, uniaxial accelerometric measures of routine activity from older studies can be feasibly compared to triaxial measures from newer studies. Comparison of new studies based on raw accelerations to older studies based on proprietary devices and measures (epochs, counts) will require additional efforts which are not addressed in this paper.","['Accelerometry', 'Adolescent', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Sports']",30305651,"[['E05.003'], ['M01.060.057'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I03.450.642.845']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
48523,Cytokine responses in the Japanese pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) head kidney cells induced with heat-killed probiotics isolated from the Mongolian dairy products.,"Cytokine responses in the Japanese pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) head kidney (HK) cells to heat-killed lactic acid bacteria probiotics isolated from the Mongolian dairy products were investigated by transcriptomic examination. The HK cells were incubated with two heat-killed bacteria, namely Lactobacillus paracasei spp. paracasei (strain 06TCa22) and L. plantarum (strain 06CC2) and the responses of 16 cytokine genes at 0 (control), 1, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h post-stimulation were assayed by multiplex RT-PCR analysis (GenomeLab Genetic Analysis System, GeXPS; Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The 16 genes included in the assay were pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1â, IL-6, IL-17A/F-3, TNF-á and TNF-N), cell-mediated immune regulators (IL-12p35, IL-12p40 and IL-18), antiviral (I-IFN-1 and IFN-ã) and other regulatory (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, IL-21, IL-10 and TGF-â1) cytokines. Despite the differences in the transcriptional profiles, expression of all the cytokines tested here was significantly elevated by both the probiotic bacterial stimulants compared with the unstimulated control. Therefore, this in vitro study has demonstrated the modulation of cytokine defense mechanisms in the HK cells by the two heat-killed probiotics indicating their potentiality as novel immunostimulants to fish. However, strain-dependent varied expression of important cytokines (cell-mediated immune regulators, antiviral and anti-inflammatory cytokines) suggests better efficacy of L. paracasei spp. paracasei strain as fish immunostimulant. Further in vivo studies to elucidate the cytokine regulation networks will validate our present observations. A careful evaluation of ant-inflammatory properties may be undertaken using single strain to affirm the immunostimulatory capability. Moreover, application timings and frequency to assess the longevity of immunostimulant effects and to make the application cost-effective need to be evaluated before any practical use in aquaculture.","['Animals', 'Aquaculture', 'Cytokines', 'Dairy Products', 'Head Kidney', 'Hot Temperature', 'Lactobacillus', 'Mongolia', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Probiotics', 'Species Specificity', 'Takifugu', 'Time Factors']",23422813,"[['B01.050'], ['J01.040.168'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['G07.203.300.350', 'J02.500.350'], ['A13.449', 'A16.835.400'], ['G01.906.595.543', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.380', 'G16.500.750.775.710.380', 'N06.230.300.100.725.232', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.380'], ['B03.353.750.450.475', 'B03.510.460.400.410.475.475', 'B03.510.550.450.475'], ['Z01.252.474.651'], ['E05.393.620.500.487'], ['G07.203.300.456.500', 'J02.500.456.500'], ['G16.824'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.875.800'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
8123,"Relationships between transforming growth factor-beta1, myostatin, and decorin: implications for skeletal muscle fibrosis.","Recent studies have shown that myostatin, first identified as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth, may also be involved in the formation of fibrosis within skeletal muscle. In this study, we further explored the potential role of myostatin in skeletal muscle fibrosis, as well as its interaction with both transforming growth factor-beta1 and decorin. We discovered that myostatin stimulated fibroblast proliferation in vitro and induced its differentiation into myofibroblasts. We further found that transforming growth factor-beta1 stimulated myostatin expression, and conversely, myostatin stimulated transforming growth factor-beta1 secretion in C2C12 myoblasts. Decorin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, was found to neutralize the effects of myostatin in both fibroblasts and myoblasts. Moreover, decorin up-regulated the expression of follistatin, an antagonist of myostatin. The results of in vivo experiments showed that myostatin knock-out mice developed significantly less fibrosis and displayed better skeletal muscle regeneration when compared with wild-type mice at 2 and 4 weeks following gastrocnemius muscle laceration injury. In wild-type mice, we found that transforming growth factor-beta1 and myostatin co-localize in myofibers in the early stages of injury. Recombinant myostatin protein stimulated myofibers to express transforming growth factor-beta1 in skeletal muscles at early time points following injection. In summary, these findings define a fibrogenic property of myostatin and suggest the existence of co-regulatory relationships between transforming growth factor-beta1, myostatin, and decorin.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Decorin', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Follistatin', 'Mice', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Muscular Diseases', 'Myoblasts', 'Myostatin', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proteoglycans', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1']",17597062,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.152'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['D09.698.735.700.750', 'D12.776.395.650.750.625', 'D12.776.395.650.875.500', 'D12.776.860.300.806.750'], ['D12.776.860.300'], ['A11.329.228'], ['C23.550.355'], ['D12.776.157.247'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A10.690.552.500.500', 'A11.620.249'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['C05.651', 'C10.668.491'], ['A11.872.620'], ['D12.644.276.954.300.925', 'D12.776.467.942.300.925', 'D23.529.942.300.925'], ['A11.251.210.100.550', 'A11.329.228.100.550'], ['D09.698.735', 'D12.776.395.650'], ['D12.776.828'], ['D12.644.276.374.687', 'D12.644.276.954.775', 'D12.776.467.374.687', 'D12.776.467.942.775', 'D23.529.374.687', 'D23.529.942.775'], ['D12.644.276.374.687.100', 'D12.644.276.954.775.100', 'D12.776.467.374.687.100', 'D12.776.467.942.775.100', 'D23.529.374.687.100', 'D23.529.942.775.100']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

35735,Health psychology: psychological adjustment to chronic disease.,"Chronic diseases carry important psychological and social consequences that demand significant psychological adjustment. The literature is providing increasingly nuanced conceptualizations of adjustment, demonstrating that the experience of chronic disease necessitates adaptation in multiple life domains. Heterogeneity in adjustment is apparent between individuals and across the course of the disease trajectory. Focusing on cancer, cardiovascular disease, and rheumatic diseases, we review longitudinal investigations of distal (socioeconomic variables, culture/ethnicity, and gender-related processes) and proximal (interpersonal relationships, personality attributes, cognitive appraisals, and coping processes) risk and protective factors for adjustment across time. We observe that the past decade has seen a surge in research that is longitudinal in design, involves adequately characterized samples of sufficient size, and includes statistical control for initial values on dependent variables. A progressively convincing characterization of risk and protective factors for favorable adjustment to chronic illness has emerged. We identify critical issues for future research.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Character', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Gender Identity', 'Humans', 'Individuality', 'Internal-External Control', 'Motivation', 'Neoplasms', 'Quality of Life', 'Sick Role', 'Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",16930096,"[['F01.058'], ['C05.550.114.154', 'C05.799.114', 'C17.300.775.099', 'C20.111.199'], ['F04.096.080', 'H02.403.090'], ['C14'], ['F01.752.190'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['I01.076.201.450.324', 'I01.880.853.100.329'], ['F01.393.446.250', 'F01.752.747.385.200', 'F01.752.747.722.200', 'F02.739.794.793.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.488'], ['F01.829.379'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['C04'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['F01.829.316.616.751'], ['I01.880.853.500.600'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

10965,Differences in genetic population structures of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from patients along Thai-Myanmar border with severe or uncomplicated malaria.,"BACKGROUND: There have been many reports on the population genetic structures of Plasmodium falciparum from different endemic regions, but few studies have examined the characteristics of isolates from patients with different clinical outcomes. The population genetic structures of P. falciparum isolates from patients with either severe or uncomplicated malaria were examined.METHODS: Twelve microsatellite DNA loci from P. falciparum were used to assess the population genetic structures of 50 isolates (i.e., 25 isolates from patients with severe malaria and 25 from patients with uncomplicated malaria) collected in the Thai-Myanmar border area between 2002 and 2005.RESULTS: Genetic diversity and effective population sizes were greater in the uncomplicated malaria group than in the severe malaria group. Evidence of genetic bottlenecks was not observed in either group. Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed in the uncomplicated malaria group. The groups demonstrated significant genetic differentiation (P < 0.05), and allele frequencies for 3 of the 12 microsatellite loci differed significantly between the two groups.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the genetic structure of P. falciparum populations in patients with severe malaria differs from that in patients with uncomplicated malaria. The microsatellite loci used in this study were presumably unrelated to antigenic features of the parasites, but, these findings suggest that some loci may influence the clinical outcome of malaria.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'DNA, Protozoan', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Malaria, Falciparum', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Myanmar', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Thailand']",18937873,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050'], ['D13.444.308.442'], ['G05.330'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C01.610.752.530.650', 'C01.920.875.650'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.340.024.850.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.252.145.570'], ['B01.043.075.380.611.561'], ['Z01.252.145.841']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
34587,"A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the opiate antagonist naltrexone in the treatment of pathological gambling urges.","OBJECTIVE: Pathological gambling (PG) is a disabling disorder experienced by approximately 1% of adults and for which few empirically validated treatments exist. This study examined the efficacy and tolerability of the opioid antagonist naltrexone in adults with PG who have urges to gamble.METHOD: An 18-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of oral naltrexone for PG. Seventy-seven individuals with DSM-IV-TR PG were randomly assigned to naltrexone (50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or 150 mg/day) or placebo. Subjects were assessed with the Pathological Gambling Adaptation of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (PG-YBOCS), the urge and behavior subscales of the PG-YBOCS, the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S), and measures of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial functioning. Data were collected from September 2002 to June 2005.RESULTS: Outcomes did not significantly differ between the various doses of naltrexone. Subjects assigned to naltrexone had significantly greater reductions in PG-YBOCS total scores (p = .0094), gambling urges (p = .0053), and gambling behavior (p = .0134) compared to subjects assigned to placebo. Subjects assigned to naltrexone also had greater improvement in overall gambling severity (reflected in the CGI-S scores) (p = .0080) and in psychosocial functioning (p = .0177) than subjects assigned to placebo. A complete analysis (N = 49) demonstrated significantly greater improvement on all variables for subjects assigned to naltrexone. A sex analysis demonstrated that men and women did not differ significantly in their response to naltrexone.CONCLUSION: Subjects assigned to naltrexone demonstrated statistically significant reductions in gambling urges and behavior in PG. Low-dose naltrexone (50 mg/day) appeared as efficacious as higher doses (100 mg/day and 150 mg/day), and all doses were well tolerated.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Gambling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naltrexone', 'Narcotic Antagonists']",18384246,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['L01.453.245.945.200'], ['F03.250'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E02.319.283'], ['F01.145.722.408', 'F03.250.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.132.577.249.706.550', 'D03.605.497.750.550', 'D03.633.400.686.750.550', 'D04.615.723.795.706.550'], ['D27.505.696.543', 'D27.505.696.663.850.512', 'D27.505.954.427.550']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
32152,Thrombin receptor PAR-1 on myelin at the node of Ranvier: a new anatomy and physiology of conduction block.,"Inflammatory demyelinating diseases of peripheral nerves are associated with altered nerve conduction and with activation of the coagulation pathway. Thrombin mediates many of its effects through protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1). We examined the possibility that thrombin may mediate conduction abnormalities through PAR-1 on rat sciatic nerve. PAR-1 was found to be present by both RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of the sciatic nerve. Activation of PAR-1 by a specific peptide agonist caused a 3-fold increase in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the sciatic nerve indicating the existence of functional receptors in the nerve. By confocal immunofluoresence microscopy of the sciatic nerve using anti-PAR-1 antibody and double staining for the paranodal marker contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) or the nodal markers gliomedin and ezrin, the receptor was localized predominantly to myelin microvilli at the node of Ranvier. Thrombin and the PAR-1-specific agonist were applied to exposed rat sciatic nerve and their effects on nerve conduction were measured. Thrombin at concentrations of 100 and 200 U/ml and PAR-1 agonists 150 and 300 muM produced a conduction block within 30 min of application. This effect was maintained for at least 1 h and was reversible by washing. The function of the nodal non-compacted myelin is not well known.

30615,Breech delivery and epidural analgesia.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of epidural analgesia on the progress and outcome of spontaneous labour in women with a singleton breech presentation at term (greater than or equal to 37 weeks).DESIGN: A retrospective study.SETTING: Data Bank, Aberdeen Maternity Hospital.SUBJECTS: 643 women (273 primiparae and 370 multiparae) with a singleton breech presentation and spontaneous onset of labour at term.OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of labour; augmentation of labour with oxytocin infusion; caesarean section rates.RESULTS: Epidural analgesia was associated with a significantly increased need for augmentation of labour with oxytocin infusion (P less than 0.001) and longer duration of labour (P less than 0.001), irrespective of parity. Comparing women who had epidural analgesia with those who did not, there was no significant difference in caesarean section rates in the first stage of labour in primiparae (odds ratio 1.79; 95% CI 0.88-3.63) or multiparae (odds ratio 0.97; 95% CI 0.48-1.96). Epidural analgesia was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of caesarean section in the second stage of labour, both in primiparae (odds ratio 5.43; 95% CI 2.46-11.95) and multiparae (odds ratio 5.37; 95% CI 2.07-13.87). The increased likelihood of caesarean section in the second stage in primiparae with epidurals was independent of the extent of cervical dilatation (less than 3 cm or greater than or equal to 3 cm) on admission. However, in multiparae with epidurals, the difference in second stage caesarean section rate was significant only when initial cervical dilatation was less than 3 cm (odds ratio 3.65; 95% CI 1.14-11.65).CONCLUSION: Epidural analgesia was associated with longer duration of labour, increased need for augmentation of labour with oxytocin infusion and a significantly higher caesarean section rate in the second stage of labour.","['Adult', 'Analgesia, Epidural', 'Analgesia, Obstetrical', 'Breech Presentation', 'Cesarean Section', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Oxytocin', 'Parity', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trial of Labor']",1294064,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E03.091.080'], ['E03.091.110'], ['C13.703.420.183', 'G08.686.520.150', 'G08.686.784.769.326.520.150'], ['E04.520.252.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.631.692.433', 'D12.644.548.691.692.433'], ['G08.686.677', 'G08.686.784.769.472', 'N06.850.490.812.600'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['G08.686.707.520'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['G08.686.784.769.326.660']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

36876,Developmental trends of eating disorder symptoms and comorbid internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine when gender differences in disordered eating symptoms emerge, when correlations between disordered eating and internalizing symptoms develop, and whether the relationship between internalizing and disordered eating symptoms varies based on age and/or gender.METHOD: We used questionnaire data from a community sample (N = 424) of third, sixth, and ninth grade girls and boys.RESULTS: Gender differences in eating pathology emerge between 12 and 15 years. The relationship between anxiety symptoms and eating pathology among both genders is weak and remains constant between the third and ninth grades. The relationship between depressive symptoms and eating pathology increases between the third and sixth grades for boys, and the sixth and ninth grades for girls.CONCLUSION: Before age 12, prevention programs for eating disorders should be given to both genders, whereas after age 12, they should target girls. Further, providers should offer intervention for comorbid depressive symptoms by third grade for boys and sixth grade for girls.","['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Anxiety', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Depression', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Sex Distribution', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",24854818,"[['M01.060.057'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['F01.470.132'], ['M01.060.406'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['F03.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.240.800', 'N01.224.803', 'N06.850.505.400.850'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
5506,Isolation and translation in vitro of poly(A)+RNA from the free-living nematode Panagrellus silusiae.,"Polysomal RNA was isolated from the free-living nematode Panagrellus silusiae. Passage of this RNA through a cellulose column resulted in the fractionation of the input RNA into poly(A)-RNA (ca. 97.5% of the total) and poly(A)+ RNA (ca. 2.5% of the total). RNase digestion, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that the poly(A)+ RNA contained poly(A) tracts that ranged from 75 to 104 nucleotides in length with a mean value of about 90 residues. There was no evidence of poly(A) sequences in the poly(A)- RNA fraction. Poly(A)+ RNA gave a 25- to 50-fold stimulation (over background) of amino acid incorporation in the wheat germ cell-free protein-synthesizing system. At least 26 proteins were evident after electrophoresis in cylindrical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Poly(A)-RNA was capable of stimulating protein synthesis in vitro with about five discrete proteins being produced. In summary, the properties of mRNA from a simple organism such as P. silusiae are very similar to those of more complex eukaryotes.","['Animals', 'Kinetics', 'Nematoda', 'Plants', 'Poly A', 'Polyribosomes', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Ribosomal', 'Triticum']",445222,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2155,Darwin and the neural bases of emotion and affective style.,"This article presents an overview of ways to think about the brain and emotion and consider the role of evolution and expression in shaping the neural circuitry of affective processing. Issues pertaining to whether there are separate unique neural modules hard-wired for emotion processing or whether affective processing uses more generalized circuitry are considered. Relations between affect and cognition--specifically, memory--are examined from the perspective of overlapping neural systems. The role of individual differences in neural function in affective style are discussed, and the concepts of affective chronometry, or the time course of emotional responding and emotion regulation, are introduced. Finally, the extent to which certain emotional traits can be viewed as trainable skills is considered, and the relevance of work on neural plasticity to the skill framework is addressed. Data from a variety of sources using different types of measures is brought to bear on these questions, including neuroimaging and psychophysiological measures, studies of individuals of different ages ranging from early childhood to old age, studies of nonhuman primates, and observations of patients with localized brain damage. Emotions are viewed as varying in both type and dimension. Honoring brain circuitry in parsing the domain of affects will result in distinctions and differentiations that are not currently incorporated in traditional classification schemes.","['Affect', 'Amygdala', 'Biological Evolution', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Humans', 'Neurons', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Receptors, Serotonin']",14766646,"[['F01.470.047'], ['A08.186.211.180.090', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.152'], ['G05.045', 'G16.075'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.140', 'D12.644.400.400.740.140', 'D12.644.548.365.740.140', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.140'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.800', 'D12.776.543.750.695.800', 'D12.776.543.750.720.850']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
30971,External validation of the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio for the diagnosis of esophageal varices in hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis.,"BACKGROUND: Screening for esophageal varices (EV) is an important part of the diagnostic workup of cirrhotic patients.AIMS: To independently validate the use of the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio for the non-invasive diagnosis of EV in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and in a sub-group of patients with compensated disease.METHODS: A platelet count/spleen diameter ratio cut-off value of 909 was evaluated for the diagnosis of EV in the whole population (n = 311) and in patients with compensated disease alone (n = 114). Compensated disease was defined as the absence of ascites as detected by abdominal ultrasound in patients who are not on diuretics and absence of hepatic encephalopathy.RESULTS: In the whole cohort (EV prevalence 49.5%), the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio 909 cut-off value had 96.9% positive predictive value, 100% negative predictive value, and 98.4% efficiency for EV diagnosis. In compensated cirrhotics (EV prevalence 26.3%), the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio 909 cut-off showed an excellent negative predictive value (100%) and a positive predictive value of 93.8%. for the diagnosis of EV.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, the platelet count/spleen diameter may be proposed as a non-invasive tool for EV diagnosis, especially in financially deprived developing countries.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Esophageal and Gastric Varices', 'Female', 'Hepatitis C', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Size', 'Platelet Count', 'Prospective Studies', 'Spleen']",18594972,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C06.405.117.240', 'C06.552.494.414'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.552.630', 'C23.550.355.412'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.660', 'E05.041.124.715', 'G07.100.100.660', 'G07.345.249.690'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.740', 'E01.370.225.625.107.700', 'E01.370.225.625.625.625', 'E05.200.500.195.107.740', 'E05.200.625.107.700', 'E05.200.625.625.625', 'E05.242.195.107.740', 'G04.140.107.740', 'G09.188.105.700'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
49823,Web-based general public opinion study of automated versus manual external chest compression.,"BACKGROUND: Only a few cardiac-arrest victims receive external chest compression (ECC) by a bystander.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the general public might start ECC more often if they used an automated device rather than a manual massage.METHODS: Web-based public opinion survey based on two short videos, one showing manual ECC and the other automated ECC (Autopulse, Zoll, France). Advantages and disadvantages (perceived efficacy, reproducibility, hazard, apprehension and acceptability) of the two techniques were evaluated on a visual analogue scale (VAS). A VAS of 1-3 was considered to indicate preference for manual ECC, 8-10 for automated ECC and 4-7 for no clear preference. The final global score was the difference between advantage and disadvantage scores.RESULTS: Overall, 1769 persons answered the questionnaire. The median VAS score for each variable was as follows: 7 (25-75 percentiles, 5-9) for efficacy, 8 (3-10) for reproducibility, 5 (3-8) for hazard, 5 (2-8) for apprehension and 5 (2-8) for acceptability. The overall median score indicated that 1034 persons (58%) preferred use of the device, 618 (35%) preferred manual ECC and 117 (7%) had no preference. There was no significant difference in the preference according to gender, education and training in first aid. However, older persons (0) preferred the use of device.CONCLUSIONS: The better 'advantages over disadvantages' score for the automated ECC device over manual ECC indicated that the general public might envisage use of the device. This could contribute to increase the frequency of resuscitation attempts by bystanders.","['Adult', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Female', 'First Aid', 'Heart Massage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest', 'Public Opinion', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Video Recording']",23558150,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E02.365.647.110'], ['E02.365.305'], ['E02.365.647.375', 'E04.100.376.458', 'E04.928.220.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.383.610'], ['I01.880.630.548'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['L01.280.960']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
671,Electrochemical anodization of graphite oxide-TiO2,"The electrochemical anodization method was used to dope graphite oxide (GO) onto TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs). This study focused on enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TNTs in the visible light region. In this study, we have checked the effect of different GO concentrations and effect of GO doping time on photocatalytic efficiency of composite. The photocatalytic activity of the GO-TNT composite was tested by degradation of an organic compound. The organic compound was most severely degraded (95%) when the GO-TNT catalyst was doped at an anodization of 60 V for 13 min and GO concentration of 0.25 g L-1. This degradation was 5.6 times higher than that of bare TiO2. The as-prepared catalyst was characterized using FE-SEM, XRD, AES, PL, UV-Vis DRS, and Raman analysis. Recycling of the GO-TNT composite was also performed in order to examine the stability of the visible light catalyst. We observed that the doping of GO on the TNT surface can enhance the photocatalytic efficiency under visible light. Graphene acts as an electron transport; therefore, GO-TNTs were favorable for the separation of e- and h+ charges. This promoted the formation of OH radicals, h+, and superoxides, all of which degrade organics.","['Catalysis', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Graphite', 'Light', 'Methylene Blue', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Nanotubes', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman', 'Superoxides', 'Titanium', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",28190232,"[['G02.130'], ['H01.181.529.307'], ['E07.305.250'], ['D01.268.150.300', 'D01.578.300'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['D02.886.369.517', 'D03.633.300.783.517'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['J01.637.512.850'], ['E05.196.712.726.802', 'E05.196.867.826.802'], ['E05.196.822.860', 'E05.196.867.890'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.850', 'D01.339.431.374.850', 'D01.650.550.750.800', 'D02.389.338.732'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['E05.196.309.742', 'E05.196.822.950', 'G01.867.950', 'G02.965']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0
8881,Yeast mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers are monomeric in detergents.,"Mitochondrial carriers are believed widely to be homodimers both in the inner membrane of the organelle and in detergents. The dimensions and molecular masses of the detergent and protein-detergent micelles were measured for yeast ADP/ATP carriers in a range of different detergents. The radius of the carrier at the midpoint of the membrane, its average radius, its Stokes' radius, its molecular mass, and its excluded volume were determined. These parameters are consistent with the known structural model of the bovine ADP/ATP carrier and they demonstrate that the yeast mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers are monomeric in detergents. Therefore, models of substrate transport have to be considered in which the carrier operates as a monomer rather than as a dimer.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Detergents', 'Micelles', 'Mitochondrial ADP, ATP Translocases', 'Molecular Weight', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae']",17056710,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['D27.720.877.265', 'J01.516.381'], ['D05.374', 'D26.255.560'], ['D12.776.157.530.625.875.500', 'D12.776.157.530.937.594', 'D12.776.543.585.450.162.225', 'D12.776.543.585.475.500', 'D12.776.543.585.625.875.500', 'D12.776.543.585.937.688', 'D12.776.575.750.500'], ['G02.494'], ['B01.300.107.795.785.800', 'B01.300.930.705.655']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The storage stability at 3 months and 4 years was determined by checking the viability of the cells and their biocontrol capability against Botrytis cinerea by measuring the percentage of reduction of disease severity on apple. The best results were obtained by the freeze-drying of the cells using a mixture of skimmed nonfat milk 10%, yeast extract 0·5% and glucose 1% as the protecting and rehydrating medium, and a quickly freezing (-70°C) before the freeze-drying. In this case, the viability of the cells after 4 years was 98%, and their antagonistic ability showed a little decrease with respect fresh cells.CONCLUSIONS: The studies showed that R. aquatilis was resistant to freezing and freeze-drying when it was used a mixture of cryoprotectants and that it was possible to obtain inoculums with high viability and good effectiveness for reduction of decay caused by B. cinerea.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:   This study is probably the first report about the resistance of R. aquatilis to freezing and freeze-drying treatments and shows that these operations could be useful for obtaining a commercial formulation of this biocontrol agent.","['Antibiosis', 'Botrytis', 'Cold Temperature', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Food Preservation', 'Freeze Drying', 'Freezing', 'Humans', 'Malus', 'Microbial Interactions', 'Rahnella']",21913947,"[['G06.550.050', 'G16.062'], ['B01.300.381.128'], ['G01.906.595.272', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.300', 'G16.500.750.775.710.300', 'N06.230.300.100.725.154', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.300'], ['E02.319.360'], ['J01.576.423.850.700'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.160.260', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.160.260', 'E02.792.156.260', 'E05.200.500.620.760.160.260', 'E05.200.750.600.760.160.260', 'E05.760.156.260'], ['G01.645.500', 'G01.906.595.272.437', 'G02.734.466'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.444'], ['G06.550'], ['B03.440.450.650', 'B03.660.250.150.655']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

37219,Renal secretion and hepatic clearance of human multiple renin forms.,"Human active renin can be separated into at least five forms by isoelectric focusing. The present study assessed the preferential renal secretion and hepatic degradation of renin forms in humans. The renin form profile of secreted renal renin was determined before transplant in an ex vivo kidney donor perfusion system and compared with the peripheral plasma multiple renin form profile of normal subjects. The effect of hepatic degradation on renin forms was assessed in hepatic vein plasma in comparison with infrarenal vena cava plasma in hypertensive patients during renal vein renin studies. The results revealed a significantly greater proportion of the more basic forms in the perfusate of donor kidneys compared with normal plasma. In hypertensive patients the proportion of the more basic renin forms in the hepatic vein was significantly decreased in comparison with the infrarenal vena cava. Thus, the human kidney may preferentially secrete the more basic renin forms. In contrast, the liver preferentially degrades the more basic forms, giving these forms a shorter plasma half-life. The preferential secretion and clearance of the more basic forms of renin may contribute to short-term control of human renin-angiotensin system activity.","['Adult', 'Cadaver', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Liver', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Reference Values', 'Renin', 'Tissue Donors']",2246033,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C23.550.260.224'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['E05.196.401.663', 'E05.301.300.663'], ['E02.870.500', 'E04.936.450.485', 'E04.950.774.400'], ['A03.620'], ['G02.640'], ['E05.978.810'], ['D08.811.277.656.074.500.780', 'D08.811.277.656.300.048.780', 'D08.811.277.656.837.750'], ['M01.898']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
29990,ER targeting and retention of the HCV NS4B protein relies on the concerted action of multiple structural features including its transmembrane domains.,"The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS4B protein, a multispanning endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, generates intracellular rearrangements of ER-derived membranes, essential for HCV replication. In this study, we characterized NS4B elements involved in the process of targeting, association and retention in the ER membrane. We investigated the localization and membrane association of a number of C- or N-terminal NS4B deletions expressed as GFP chimeras by biochemical and fluorescence microscopy techniques. A second set of GFP-NS4B chimeras containing the plasma membrane ecto-ATPase CD39 at the C-terminus of each NS4B deletion mutant was used to further examine the role of N-terminal NS4B sequences in ER retention. Several structural elements, besides the first two transmembrane domains (TMs), within the NS4B N-terminal half (residues 1-130) were found to mediate association of the NS4B-GFP chimeras with ER membranes. Both TM1 and TM2 are required for ER anchoring and retention but are not sufficient for ER retention. Sequences upstream of TM1 are also required. These include two putative amphipathic alpha-helices and a Leucine Rich Repeat-like motif, a sequence highly conserved in all HCV genotypes. The N-terminal 55peptidic sequence, containing the 1st amphipathic helix, mediates association of the 55N-GFP chimera with cellular membranes including the ER, but is dispensable for ER targeting of the entire NS4B molecule. Importantly, the C-terminal 70peptidic sequence can associate with membranes positive for ER markers in the absence of any predicted TMs. In conclusion, HCV NS4B targeting and retention in the ER results from the concerted action of several NS4B structural elements.","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antigens, CD', 'Apyrase', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Hepacivirus', 'Humans', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins', 'Virus Replication']",20001747,"[['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500', 'G02.111.570.820.709.600.500'], ['D23.050.301.264.035', 'D23.101.100.110'], ['D08.811.277.040.050'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.248'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.196.181.400.454.720', 'E05.196.401.319.720', 'E05.196.700', 'E05.393.760.705.685'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.776.964.900'], ['G06.920.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
22259,Ethno-ornithology and conservation of wild birds in the semi-arid Caatinga of northeastern Brazil.,"The utilization of birds as pets has been recognized as one of the principal threats to global avifauna. Most of the information about the use and sale of birds as pets has been limited to areas of high biodiversity and whose impacts of anthropic actions have been widely broadcast internationally, for example for the Amazon Forest and forest remnants of Southeast Asia. The Caatinga predominates in the semi-arid region of Brazil, and is one of the semi-arid biomes with the greatest biological diversity in the world, where 511 species of birds exist. Many of these birds are used as pets, a common practice in the region, which has important conservationist implications but has been little studied. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to detail aspects of the use of birds as pets in a locality in the semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil. Information on the use of avifauna was obtained through interviews and visits to the homes of 78 wild bird keepers. A total of 41 species of birds were recorded, mostly of the families Emberizidae (n = 9 species), Columbidae (n = 7 species), Icteridae (n = 6 species) and Psittacidae (n = 3 species). The birds that were most often recorded were Paroaria dominicana (n = 79 especimens), Sporophila albogularis (n = 67), Aratinga cactorum (n = 49), Sporophila lineola (n = 36), Sicalis flaveola (n = 29) and Sporophila nigricollis (n = 27). The use of wild birds in the area studied, as an example of what occurs in other places in the semi-arid Northeast, demonstrates that such activities persist in the region, in spite of being illegal, and have been happening in clandestine or semi-clandestine manner. No statistically significant correlation were found between socioeconomic factors and keeping birds as pets reflects the cultural importance of this practice of rearing wild birds for pets in the region, which is widespread among the local population, independent of socioeconomic factors. Obviously, human pressure on the avifauna exploited has ecological implications and makes it clear that conservationist measures should consider the cultural, economic and social aspects of these practices. These measures should be carried out by both directly combating the illegal traffic of animals and promoting educational campaigns aimed at all the players involved, from the collectors up to the consumer and wild bird keepers.","['Animals', 'Biodiversity', 'Birds', 'Brazil', 'Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Humans', 'Pets']",23445769,"[['B01.050'], ['G16.500.275.157.049', 'N06.230.124.049'], ['B01.050.150.900.248'], ['Z01.107.757.176'], ['J01.256', 'N06.230.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.050.116.600']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
24861,Transcriptomic analysis of American ginseng seeds during the dormancy release process by RNA-Seq.,"American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is an important herb that is cultivated in China, North American, and South Korea. It is propagated from seed, but the seed has deep dormancy characteristics described as morphophysiological dormancy. Two-stage temperature stratification, a warm (15-20°C) and cold (2°C) stratification period of 6 months, has been used successfully for seed dormancy release. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of seed dormancy release in the stratification process. In this study, seed development after pollination and seed development in the dormancy release process were investigated in American ginseng. The transcriptome during seed dormancy release was analyzed using RNA-Seq technology and 78,207 unigenes (mean length 531 bp) were generated. Based on similarity searches of public databases, 54,292 of the unigenes (69.4%) were functionally annotated. Further, three digital gene expression (DGE) libraries were sequenced and differences in gene expression at three stages during seed cold stratification were examined. The greatest number of differentially expressed genes occurred in the 90DCS versus 180DCS libraries, while the lowest number of differentially expressed genes occurred in the 135DCS verus 180DCS libraries. GO enrichment analysis revealed that 59, 29, and 39 GO terms were significantly enriched in the biological process, molecular function, and cell component GO categories, respectively. There were 25,190 genes with KEGG pathway annotation in the three DGE libraries and their enrichment pathways were compared. The gene expressions of 30 selected unigenes were validated using quantitative PCR. This study is the first to provide the transcriptome sequences for seed dormancy release in American ginseng, and demonstrates the successful use of DGE profiling data for analyzing transcriptomic variation during dormancy release. These data provide a basis for future researches of seed dormancy in morphophysiological dormancy seeds in non-model plants.","['Base Sequence', 'Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Plant', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Panax', 'Plant Dormancy', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Sequence Homology', 'Transcriptome']",25790114,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['H01.158.273.180', 'L01.313.124'], ['E05.393.332'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.393', 'G05.360.340.365.500'], ['E05.393.760.479', 'L01.453.245.667.580'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.087.500'], ['G07.345.625.875', 'G15.357.500'], ['A18.024.500.750', 'G07.203.300.775', 'J02.500.775'], ['E05.393.760.710'], ['G02.111.810', 'G05.810'], ['G02.111.873.750', 'G05.297.700.750', 'G05.360.920']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
25634,Effects of age on dynamic accommodation.,"Visual accommodation plays a critical role in one's visual perception and activities of daily living. Age-related accommodation loss poses an increased risk to older adults' safety and independence. Although extensive effort has been made towards understanding the effect of age on steady-state accommodation, dynamic aspects of accommodation is still unknown. A study was therefore conducted to investigate age-related dynamic accommodative characteristics utilising a modified autorefractor. Ten individuals from each of three age groups (i.e. younger group: 20 to 29 years old; middle-aged group: 40 to 49 years old; older group: 60 to 69 years old) were recruited and their dynamic accommodation responses were examined. The laboratory experiment was designed to assess dynamic accommodation associated with an abrupt change from a constant far target (400 cm, 50 cd/m(2)) to a near target (70 cm, 100 cd/m(2) or 20 cd/m(2)), which aimed to simulate car dashboard reading behaviour while driving. The results of the study indicated that age and target intensity both had a significant impact on dynamic accommodation. These effects were attributed to both the age-related physiological limitation of the eye as well as to central neural processing delay. A method of measuring dynamic accommodation and the implications of the study are discussed. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: The results of the study indicate that age and target intensity both have a significant impact on dynamic accommodation. These effects are attributed to age-related physiological limitation of the eye as well as central neural processing delay and to decreased sensitivity of the cone photoreceptors. To enhance the visual performance of the ageing population involving dynamic accommodation, target distance and target light intensity should be carefully evaluated to facilitate effective viewing.","['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adaptation, Physiological', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aging', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Visual Perception', 'Young Adult']",20582770,"[['G14.010'], ['G07.025', 'G16.012.500'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G07.345.124'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['E05.796.817', 'F02.830.650', 'F04.669.817', 'G11.561.677'], ['L01.559.423.557'], ['F02.463.593.932'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
20171,Gallic acid-based small-molecule inhibitors of JC and BK polyomaviral infection.,"JCPyV and BKPyV are common human polyomaviruses that cause lifelong asymptomatic persistent infections in their hosts. In immunosuppressed individuals, increased replication of JCPyV and BKPyV cause significant disease. JCPyV causes a fatal and rapidly progressing demyelinating disease known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. BKPyV causes hemorrhagic cystitis and polyomavirus associated nephropathy in bone marrow transplant recipients and in renal transplant recipients respectively. There are no specific anti-viral therapies to treat polyomavirus induced diseases. Based on detailed studies of the structures of these viruses bound to their receptors we screened several compounds that possessed similar chemical space as sialic acid for their ability to bind the virus. Positive hits in the assay were restricted to gallic acid based compounds that mimic the viruses known cellular glycan receptors. Pre-treatment of virions with these inhibitors reduced virus infection in cell culture and as such may form the basis for the development of virion specific antagonists to treat these infections.","['Antiviral Agents', 'BK Virus', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Gallic Acid', 'Humans', 'JC Virus', 'Virus Attachment']",24960120,"[['D27.505.954.122.388'], ['B04.280.210.700.615.100', 'B04.613.204.670.615.100'], ['A11.251.210'], ['E05.290.750', 'E05.337.550'], ['D02.241.223.100.300.200', 'D02.241.511.390.200', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.281.200', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B04.280.210.700.615.400', 'B04.613.204.670.615.400'], ['G06.920.868']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The probability of adult overweight among 10-year old children was greater than 0.5 (50% overweight threshold) if their BMI exceeded 17 kg/m2 in black girls, 20 in white girls and 18 in boys of either race. Similarly, the 50% BMI overweight thresholds among 15-year-old children were 23 kg/m2 for black girls, 25 for white girls and 22 for boys of either race. The 50% PI overweight thresholds (in kg/m2) were 12 and 14 for 10-year-old black girls and white girls, respectively; and 14 and 16 for 15-year-old black girls and white girls, respectively. Among boys, the 50% PI threshold was 13 kg/m3 regardless of age or race.CONCLUSION: The BMI and the PI in childhood were both useful in assessing sex-and race-specific risks of adult overweight. However, assessments based on the Ponderal index were less affected by age and race than those based on the BMI, particularly among boys. Hence, to establish general weight goals for children, aimed at preventing adult obesity, the PI could be a much better choice than the BMI.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Continental Ancestry Group', 'Aging', 'Anthropometry', 'Body Height', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Humans', 'Louisiana', 'Obesity', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors']",8856393,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.686.508.100'], ['G07.345.124'], ['E01.370.600.024', 'E05.041', 'N06.850.505.200.100'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160.100', 'E05.041.124.160.500', 'G07.100.100.160.100', 'G07.345.249.314.100'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.107.567.875.750.480'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
33723,Crystallographic and spectroscopic snapshots reveal a dehydrogenase in action.,"Aldehydes are ubiquitous intermediates in metabolic pathways and their innate reactivity can often make them quite unstable. There are several aldehydic intermediates in the metabolic pathway for tryptophan degradation that can decay into neuroactive compounds that have been associated with numerous neurological diseases. An enzyme of this pathway, 2-aminomuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, is responsible for 'disarming' the final aldehydic intermediate. Here we show the crystal structures of a bacterial analogue enzyme in five catalytically relevant forms: resting state, one binary and two ternary complexes, and a covalent, thioacyl intermediate. We also report the crystal structures of a tetrahedral, thiohemiacetal intermediate, a thioacyl intermediate and an NAD(+)-bound complex from an active site mutant. These covalent intermediates are characterized by single-crystal and solution-state electronic absorption spectroscopy. The crystal structures reveal that the substrate undergoes an E/Z isomerization at the enzyme active site before an sp(3)-to-sp(2) transition during enzyme-mediated oxidation.","['Aldehydes', 'Aminomuconate-Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase', 'Computational Biology', 'Crystallography', 'Kinetics', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Conformation', 'Pseudomonas fluorescens', 'X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy']",25565451,"[['D02.047'], ['D08.811.682.657.163.342'], ['H01.158.273.180', 'L01.313.124'], ['E05.196.309', 'H01.181.529.240'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.196.566'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625.325', 'B03.660.250.580.590.210'], ['E05.196.867.972']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
25640,Synchronous breast invasive ductal carcinoma and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma: case report.,"Diagnosis of synchronous primary cancers in one patient is a relatively rare event. The well-known synchronous primary cancers of women are combined ovarian and endometrial cancers, especially when both are the endometrioid cell type. Although breast cancer and endometrial cancer are two common female malignancies, they often occur during the postmenopausal period. Therefore, the possibility of concomitant breast cancer and endometrial cancer in a younger woman (premenopausal) is often neglected. The reported case is an example of this situation. A 37-year-old woman was diagnosed with synchronous breast invasive ductal carcinoma and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Since this condition is rarely reported, the correlated risk factors are worthy of our attention and the strategy for prevention is highlighted.","['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast', 'Carcinoma, Endometrioid', 'Endometrial Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Premenopause']",21518130,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.232.500', 'C04.557.470.615.132.500', 'C04.588.180.390', 'C17.800.090.500.390'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.240', 'C04.588.945.418.948.585.124', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705.331', 'C13.351.937.418.685.331', 'C13.351.937.418.875.200.124', 'C19.391.630.705.331'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.585', 'C13.351.500.852.762.200', 'C13.351.937.418.875.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.651'], ['G08.686.157.500.812', 'G08.686.841.249.500.812']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
2612,Self-directed arm therapy at home after stroke with a sensor-based virtual reality training system.,"BACKGROUND: The effect of rehabilitative training after stroke is dose-dependent. Out-patient rehabilitation training is often limited by transport logistics, financial resources and a lack of motivation/compliance. We studied the feasibility of an unsupervised arm therapy for self-directed rehabilitation therapy in patients' homes.METHODS: An open-label, single group study involving eleven patients with hemiparesis due to stroke (27 ± 31.5 months post-stroke) was conducted. The patients trained with an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based virtual reality system (ArmeoSenso) in their homes for six weeks. The self-selected dose of training with ArmeoSenso was the principal outcome measure whereas the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity (FMA-UE), the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and IMU-derived kinematic metrics were used to assess arm function, training intensity and trunk movement. Repeated measures one-way ANOVAs were used to assess differences in training duration and clinical scores over time.RESULTS: All subjects were able to use the system independently in their homes and no safety issues were reported. Patients trained on 26.5 ± 11.5 days out of 42 days for a duration of 137 ± 120 min per week. The weekly training duration did not change over the course of six weeks (p = 0.146). The arm function of these patients improved significantly by 4.1 points (p = 0.003) in the FMA-UE. Changes in the WMFT were not significant (p = 0.552). ArmeoSenso based metrics showed an improvement in arm function, a high number of reaching movements (387 per session), and minimal compensatory movements of the trunk while training.CONCLUSIONS: Self-directed home therapy with an IMU-based home therapy system is safe and can provide a high dose of rehabilitative therapy. The assessments integrated into the system allow daily therapy monitoring, difficulty adaptation and detection of maladaptive motor patterns such as trunk movements during reaching.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Unique identifier: NCT02098135 .","['Aged', 'Arm', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Movement Disorders', 'Paresis', 'Recovery of Function', 'Self Care', 'Stroke Rehabilitation', 'Therapy, Computer-Assisted', 'Treatment Outcome', 'User-Computer Interface']",27515583,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['A01.378.800.075'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C10.228.662'], ['C10.597.636', 'C23.888.592.643'], ['G16.757'], ['E02.900', 'I03.050.563', 'N02.421.784.680'], ['E02.760.169.063.500.477.500', 'E02.831.477.500', 'H02.403.680.600.750.500', 'N02.421.784.511.500'], ['E02.950', 'L01.313.500.750.100.710'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['L01.224.900.910']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
23781,[Value of CT imaging in the differentiation of gastric leiomyomas from gastric stromal tumors].,"Objective: To explore the application value of CT imaging in differentiating gastric stromal tumors (GST) from gastric leiomyomas (GLMs). Methods: CT images of patients with GST (n=65) or GLMs (n=13, maximum diameter of tumor ?5 cm) proved by surgery and pathology were retrospectively analyzed. The tumor size, location, contour, growth pattern, degree and pattern of enhancement, calcification, necrosis, surface ulceration, lymph nodes, and patient clinical data were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to assess the measurement and calculation parameters in the differentiation of GST and GLMs. Results: Between the GST and GLMs groups, there was no statistically significant difference in the contour, growth pattern, calcification, surface ulceration, and patient's sex (P>0.05). CT values of in plain scans, degree of enhancement in arterial phase (DE1), size, location and pattern of enhancement were found to be different between GST and GLMs (P<0.05). When the cutoff value of the maximum tumor diameter was 3.2 cm, the area under ROC curve, sensitivity and specificity were 0.707, 92.3%(12/13) and 60.6%(40/66), respectively. When the cutoff value of age was 59 years, the area under ROC curve, sensitivity and specificity were 0.773, 92.3% (12/13) and 46.2% (30/65), respectively. Taking the cutoff value of 10.9 HU as the degree of enhancement in arterial phase (DE1), the area under ROC curve, sensitivity and specificity were 0.774, 84.6% (11/13) and 77.3% (51/66), respectively. Using a cutoff value of 30.3 HU, the sensitivity, specificity, and the area under ROC curve were 84.6% (11/13), 65.2% (43/66), and 0.731, respectively. Conclusions: CT examination in addition to clinical data can be very helpful for the differential diagnosis of GLMs from GSTs in maximum diameter ?5 cm.","['Calcinosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors', 'Humans', 'Leiomyoma', 'Male', 'ROC Curve', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stomach Neoplasms', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Tumor Burden']",28219211,"[['C18.452.174.130'], ['E01.171'], ['C04.557.450.565.370', 'C06.301.371.308', 'C06.405.249.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.450.590.450'], ['E05.318.370.800.750', 'E05.318.740.872.750', 'N05.715.360.325.700.680', 'N06.850.520.445.800.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['C04.588.274.476.767', 'C06.301.371.767', 'C06.405.249.767', 'C06.405.748.789'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E05.041.124.892']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
19989,Morphologic effects of inhaled diesel engine exhaust on lungs of rats: comparison with effects of coal oven flue gas mixed with pyrolyzed pitch.,"Three groups of 96 female Wistar rats exposed for up to 2.5 years to clean air, unfiltered or filtered Diesel engine exhaust, respectively, were examined histopathologically. In addition, 120 rats were exposed for the same length of time to coal oven flue gas mixed with pitch fumes pyrolyzed under nitrogen. This experiment was designed to enable a morphological comparison of the lung changes induced by the two different types of exhausts. Most of the rats in the Diesel exhaust group had pulmonary deposits of large amounts of carbonaceous particles phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and accompanied by severe chronic inflammatory changes characterized by alveolar septal thickening, bronchiolo-alveolar hyperplasia and alveolar lipoproteinosis. Squamous metaplasia was observed in 65% of the animals. Primary tumours occurred in 15 rats (apprx. 16%). Six rats had bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas, 7 had squamous cell tumours and 2 had both bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and squamous cell tumours. In an effort to clarify the malignant potential of the squamous cell tumours, criteria for their classification were established on the basis of behaviour and cytological appearance. Eight of the squamous cell tumours were classified as benign, keratinizing, cystic tumours and one was classified as a grade I carcinoma. In contrast to the Diesel exhaust exposure group, the lungs of the rats exposed to coal oven flue gas mixed with pyrolyzed pitch had much less severe inflammatory changes, but developed 20 squamous cell tumours (apprx. 17%). These tumours were classified as 16 benign, keratinizing, cystic tumours and 4 carcinomas (2 each of grade I and II). In addition, one bronchiolo-alveolar adenoma and one adenocarcinoma occurred. No primary lung tumours were observed in the control group or in the group exposed to filtered Diesel exhaust. A comparison of the incidence and morphological features of the pulmonary lesions obtained suggested different processes of tumour induction by the two types of exhausts with unfiltered Diesel exhaust having more promotional effect and PAH-enriched coal oven flue gas being a more complete carcinogen.","['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Coal', 'Female', 'Hyperplasia', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Polycyclic Compounds', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Resins, Plant', 'Vehicle Emissions']",2435503,"[['B01.050'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['D20.345.108', 'N06.230.132.258.108'], ['C23.550.444'], ['E05.481'], ['A04.411'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['D04'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D05.750.078.840', 'D20.215.721.500'], ['D20.832']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
20176,The determination at housing of exposure to gastrointestinal nematode infections in first-grazing season calves.,"Various parameter estimates were assessed at housing in calves that had been exposed to gastrointestinal nematodes during a first grazing season. The analysis involved 41 groups of first grazing season (FGS) calves on 15 different farms in Belgium and comprised groups that had received chemoprophylactic treatment and untreated controls. Serum pepsinogen levels gave the clearest division between chemoprophylactic-treated calf groups (all were <2.6 U tyr), and untreated calf groups in which sub-clinical (range: 2.0-4.1 U tyr) and clinical infections (range 3.7-6.3 U tyr) occurred. There was also a tight relationship between individual pepsinogen values and adult Ostertagia burdens obtained at slaughter. In chemoprophylactic-treated groups there was a significant negative relationship between mean serum pepsinogen levels at housing and the proportion of the grazing season covered by different chemoprophylactic systems. Although only limited data on crude adult Ostertagia antigen ELISA were available, a good relationship between optical densities and estimated exposure was also found. The parasitological parameters, faecal egg counts and pasture Ostertagia larval counts at housing, and weight gain per day, gave less clear divisions among the three categories (chemoprophylaxis, sub-clinical and clinical). Distinguishing how much exposure a calf group has experienced during a first grazing season could help in designing more appropriate control measures for the FGS calves in the next year, assuring good protection and at the same time allowing sufficient exposure for the development of acquired immunity to Ostertagia, and for this serum pepsinogen is recommended.","['Abomasum', 'Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Antibodies, Helminth', 'Belgium', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Male', 'Ostertagia', 'Ostertagiasis', 'Parasite Egg Count', 'Pepsinogen A', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Weight Gain']",9950338,"[['A13.869.106'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.250.075'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.185', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.185', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.185'], ['Z01.542.115'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['C22.196'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['A12.459'], ['C06.405'], ['G16.527.200.400'], ['B01.050.500.500.294.400.968.746.432'], ['C01.610.335.508.700.775.825.580'], ['E01.370.225.932.600', 'E05.200.932.600'], ['D08.622.509.700', 'D12.776.811.243.509.700'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C23.888.144.243.926', 'G07.345.249.314.120.200.926']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
15899,Method of recording cerebrospinal fluid pressure at three anatomic places in conscious and unrestrained adult wistar rats.,"There does not appear to be a consensus on the normal values of cerebrospinal fluid pressure (Pcsf) in rats because of the different conditions in which each experiment has been done. Anaesthesia, restraint or recordings from different anatomical places and the use of simultaneous infusions could produce a great variability in the obtained results and because of that the average Pcsf in rats has been reported to be between 2 and about 18.5 cm H2O. The aim of this study is to provide new information about the normal values of Pcsf in adult, conscious rats by carrying out long-term measurements, for 3 consecutive days, from different anatomical places. Thirty male Wistar rats divided in three experimental groups of ten animals each were used.

35262,A nonclinical model for predicting scaling and root planing case difficulty.,"As students progress through their clinical education, the integration of patient types challenging the development of scaling and root planing skills is necessary. A clinical screening to determine case type is ideal; however, some programs do not have the time or resources for a clinical screening, and some patients do not want to take the time for the additional screening appointment. The intent of the screening process is to determine case type and/or treatment needs. In some cases, this information is used to match student educational requirements with patient needs. Even though an institution or program may have a clinical screening process, patient assignment can still be haphazard, resulting in an inequitable distribution of patient case types to students. It seems the problem is due, in part, to the absence of a mechanism for early identification and distribution of case types. The purpose of this study was to develop a model for initially predicting patient scaling and root planing case difficulty from nonclinical, patient variables obtained during a telephone interview. Dental hygiene student evaluation forms (n = 1,356) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Dentistry were gathered and categorized by patient case difficulty. A sample of charts was selected from each scaling classification. The scaling classifications were then subdivided into two samples for developing and testing the model. Variables selected from the patient charts as possible predictors were smoking status, race, age, gender, date of last prophylaxis, periodontal classification, and oral hygiene habits (brushing and flossing).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Adult', 'Dental Hygienists', 'Dental Scaling', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Root Planing']",1941105,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.526.485.067.105.376', 'N02.360.067.105.376'], ['E06.721.189.350', 'E06.761.227.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E06.721.189.350.650', 'E06.721.874.650', 'E06.761.227.350.650']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
1591,The 1999 Stockholm Consensus Conference on quality specifications in laboratory medicine.,"The setting of analytical quality specifications in laboratory medicine has been a topic of discussion and debate for over 50 years: 15 years ago, as the subject matured and a profusion of recommendations appeared, many of them from expert groups, it was realised by a number of leading professionals that there was a need for a global consensus on the setting of such specifications. The Stockholm Conference held in 1999 on ""Strategies to set global analytical quality specifications in laboratory medicine"" achieved this and advocated the ubiquitous application of a hierarchical structure of approaches. The hierarchy has five levels, namely: 1) evaluation of the effect of analytical performance on clinical outcomes in specific clinical settings; 2) evaluation of the effect of analytical performance on clinical decisions in general using a) data based on components of biological variation, or b) analysis of clinicians' opinions; 3) published professional recommendations from a) national and international expert bodies, or b) expert local groups or individuals; 4) performance goals set by a) regulatory bodies, or b) organisers of external quality assessment (EQA) schemes; and 5) goals based on the current state of the art as a) demonstrated by data from EQA or proficiency testing scheme, or b) found in current publications on methodology. This approach has been much used since its wide promulgation, but there have been ongoing criticisms and new developments. The time seems right for an objective reappraisal of recommended strategies to set analytical performance goals.","['Clinical Laboratory Techniques', 'Consensus', 'Laboratory Proficiency Testing', 'Quality Control']",25720125,"[['E01.370.225', 'E05.200'], ['F01.829.316.068', 'F02.463.785.373.433'], ['J01.897.608.500', 'N04.761.700.512'], ['J01.897.608']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

15088,The role of intracellular calcium in A-23187 stimulated and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug treated blood platelets.,"A significant concentration-dependent difference was found between beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in their ability to inhibit A23187-induced isolated platelet aggregation. In the absence of extracellular calcium ions the following rank order of potency to inhibit calcium ionophore stimulated platelet aggregation was shown: propranolol > bevantolol > alprenolol > metipranolol > oxprenolol > atenolol > pindolol > metoprolol approximately sotalol approximately practolol. The interruption of induced aggregation, as well as inhibition of aggregation, in the absence of extracellular calcium ions indicated interference of inhibitory beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs with intramembrane or intraplatelet calcium pools activated with A23187. This suggestion was supported by the reversal of the inhibitory effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in the presence of extracellular calcium ions. The effect was dose dependent and occurred within 30 sec after calcium administration. The results indicated that inhibitory beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, possessing a cationic amphiphilic structure, suppressed calcium mobilization in A23187-stimulated platelets, most probably after entering platelets. This explains why lipophilic drugs are more effective than hydrophilic ones in calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated platelets.","['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Animals', 'Calcimycin', 'Calcium', 'Male', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",7913320,"[['D27.505.519.625.050.200.200', 'D27.505.696.577.050.200.200'], ['B01.050'], ['D03.633.100.221.173'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['G09.188.390.600'], ['G09.188.370.687', 'G09.188.390.600.640'], ['D27.505.954.502.780'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
38097,"Scientific tools, fake treatments, or triggers for psychological healing: how clinical trial participants conceptualise placebos.","Placebos are an essential tool in randomised clinical trials, where they are used to control for bias and contextual healing effects. Placebos and their effects are also studied from multiple diverse perspectives, but the perspectives of placebo recipients are seldom considered. Research shows that people form cognitive and affective representations of active treatments such as medicines, and that they use these representations to guide their behaviour; it seems reasonable to suggest that people might also think about and develop representations of placebos. We adopted a qualitative approach to examine in detail how participants in one RCT, conducted in the USA, conceptualised placebos. 12 people were interviewed 3 times each, at the start, middle, and end of a trial of placebo effects and acupuncture for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The interview data were analysed inductively and we identified four ways in which the participants conceptualised placebos: placebos are necessary for research; placebo effects are fake; placebo acupuncture is not real acupuncture; placebos have real effects mediated by psychological mechanisms. Participants' conceptualisations of placebos were dynamic and situated in a broader psychological and socio-cultural context. Seeing placebo effects as legitimate seemed to be facilitated by having more holistic models of healing, viewing IBS as psychological, and seeing treatment as multifactorial. However, some participants maintained a negative view of placebo effects (e.g. as illusions) that was apparently inconsistent with their other beliefs (e.g. in mind-body healing mechanisms). This may indicate a dominance of negative discourses around placebos at a socio-cultural level. Negative views of placebos are inconsistent with evidence that placebo treatments can have positive effects on symptoms. RCT participants should be informed about potential benefits of placebo treatments to avoid misunderstandings and unease. Future work should improve methods of providing participants with full accurate information about placebos and their effects.","['Acupuncture Therapy', 'Adult', 'Attitude to Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Research Subjects']",22285289,"[['E02.190.044'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F01.100.150', 'N05.300.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.880.604.473.650.718', 'I01.880.604.583.427', 'N03.706.437.650.312', 'N03.706.535.489'], ['E05.318.308.420', 'L01.399.250.520', 'N05.715.360.300.400', 'N06.850.520.308.420'], ['C06.405.469.158.272.608'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N05.715.350.350.625', 'N06.850.490.734.875'], ['D26.660', 'E02.785'], ['E05.318.372.250.250.365.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250.365.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250.365.500'], ['M01.774']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
7959,Detection and localization of HIV-1 DNA in renal tissues by in situ polymerase chain reaction.,"The localization of HIV-1 DNA in renal tissues is critically important for understanding pathogenesis of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), but the clarification has been technically challenging. We applied in situ polymerase chain reaction (IS-PCR) to human renal tissues to demonstrate viral entry into the renal epithelial cells in vivo. To test the specificity of this method and to determine the cell types infected, we used IS-PCR followed by in situ hybridization (ISH) and IS-PCR followed by immunohistochemistry and histochemical counterstains. Brief 2 hour fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde had 92.9% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detection of viral DNA in renal biopsies of HIVAN patients, compared to 70.8% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity in renal biopsies fixed overnight in 10% formalin. Under optimized conditions, the only signals detectable in HIV-1 seronegative cases were false positives attributable to renal tubular apoptosis. In HIVAN cases, positive signal was observed in podocytes, parietal cells, renal tubular cells, and interstitial leukocytes. Immunohistochemical co-labeling for pan-T cell and macrophage markers revealed that the interstitial leukocytes with positivity for HIV-1 DNA included both T cells and macrophages. Application of ISH after IS-PCR showed the same distribution of signal as observed using IS-PCR alone, confirming the specificity of the technique. IS-PCR is a powerful technique to detect viral DNA in human tissue sections, but requires proper use of negative controls to set optimal fixation, protein digestion, and amplification conditions.","['AIDS-Associated Nephropathy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA, Viral', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Kidney', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes']",16437385,"[['C01.221.250.875.050', 'C01.221.812.640.400.072', 'C01.778.640.400.072', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.050', 'C01.925.813.400.072', 'C12.777.419.050', 'C13.351.968.419.050', 'C20.673.480.050'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['E01.354.506'], ['B04.820.650.589.650.350.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670.325', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670.325', 'E05.200.500.620.670.325', 'E05.200.750.600.670.325', 'E05.393.661.475'], ['A05.810.453'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
49595,Regulation of interstitial cell differentiation in Hydra attenuata. VI. Positional pattern of nerve cell commitment is independent of local nerve cell density.,"The interstitial cell of hydra is a multipotent stem cell, which produces nerve cells as one of its differentiated cell types. The amount of interstitial cell commitment to nerve differentiation varies in an axially dependent pattern along the body column. The distribution of nerve cell density has the same equivalent axial pattern. These facts have led to speculation that the regulation of nerve cell commitment is dictated by the nerve cell density. We examined this question by assaying interstitial cell commitment behaviour in 2 cases where the normal nerve cell density of the tissue had been perturbed: (1) in epithelial hydra in which no nerve cells were present; and (2) in hydra derived from regenerating-tip isolates in which the nerve density was increased nearly 4-fold. We found no evidence of regulation of nerve cell commitment in response to the abnormal nerve cell densities. However, the typical axial pattern of nerve commitment was still obtained in both sets of experiments, which suggests that interstitial cell commitment to nerve differentiation is dependent on some parameter of axial location that is not associated directly with the local nerve cell density.","['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Hydra', 'Neurons', 'Regeneration']",7334065,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.195', 'E05.200.500.195', 'E05.242.195', 'G04.140'], ['G04.152'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['A11.436'], ['B01.050.500.308.485.400'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['G16.762']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
17806,Metal ion binding patterns of acyclovir: molecular recognition between this antiviral agent and copper(II) chelates with iminodiacetate or glycylglycinate.,"In order to deepen on metal-binding patterns of acyclovir (acv), {[Cu(IDA)(acv)]·2MeOH}(n) (1) and [Cu(glygly)(acv)]·H(2)O (2) compounds have been synthesized and investigated by X-ray crystallography as well as spectral and thermal methods. These compounds have been chosen upon the assumption that iminodiacetate (IDA) and glycylglycinate (glygly) chelating ligands would bind copper(II) with mer-tridentate conformation, supplying two terminal H-acceptor carboxylate groups (IDA) or one H-acceptor carboxylate and one H-donor primary amino group (glygly). The main aim of this work was to clarify if the amino group of glygly can build an intra-molecular interligand H-bonding interaction to reinforce the Cu-N7(acv) bond. Our results are discussed in the context of an up-to-date critical look regarding the related structural information. From the viewpoint of molecular recognition, the structure of 1 shows that the chelate-nucleoside recognition only involves the Cu-N7(acv) coordination bond. In contrast, the molecular complex of 2 exhibits the Cu-N7(acv) coordination bond reinforced by an intra-molecular (glygly)N-H···O6(acv) interaction (2.961(3)?, 140.5°).","['Acyclovir', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Chelating Agents', 'Coordination Complexes', 'Copper', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Imino Acids', 'Ions', 'Ligands', 'Metals', 'Organometallic Compounds', 'Tetracyclines']",21443851,"[['D03.633.100.759.758.399.454.250'], ['D27.505.954.122.388'], ['D27.505.519.914.500', 'D27.720.832.500'], ['D01.234', 'D02.257'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['E05.196.309.742.225'], ['D02.241.081.583', 'D02.491.485', 'D12.125.072.401'], ['D01.248.497'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['D01.552'], ['D02.691'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.900', 'D04.615.562.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45154,How college students diagnosed with anxiety disorders and/or depression use everyday technology.,"Anxiety disorders and/or depression are the most frequently diagnosed mental health problems (MHP) among American college students. Everyday technology (EDT) is being used with those who have MHP to help them cope with the mental/cognitive disabilities arising from having anxiety and/or depression. Deveau investigated the types of EDT students with MHP use to manage their roles as college students. While this research indicated that individuals with MHP were open to learning about EDT they can use, the author recommended further investigation of the topic. This qualitative study further investigated what types of EDT college students use to manage their anxiety disorder and/or depression. Our research found that while college students with anxiety and depression are familiar with and willing to use EDT to help compensate for some of the issues they have resulting from their anxiety and depression, some reported that the use of EDT contributes to their problems. Implications for further investigation include continuing to examine the use of EDT amongst a larger group of college students. Future research should also investigate creating a peer run technology group, taught by interested student such as occupational therapy, psychology or computer science students to name a few, to inform students about apps to manage scheduling, routines, medication management and symptoms management. Additionally, the positive and negative aspects of social media and how to manage ones use of it use would be a relevant topic for group discussion.Implications for rehabilitationWhile most college students currently use everyday technology as a part of their lives, it has positive and negative meanings to college students who have anxiety and/or depression.Finding out what a user wants to do with technology and the meaning it has for them is a critical part of insuring the right match between a person and an assistive technology intervention.Consider a full range of no to high technology options when working with college students who experience the mental/cognitive disabilities resulting from mental health problems to identify assistive technology solutions.","['Adolescent', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Depression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microcomputers', 'Mobile Applications', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Smartphone', 'Students', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Universities', 'Young Adult']",30318942,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F03.080'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.230.260.550'], ['L01.224.900.685'], ['E07.796'], ['L01.178.847.698.300.250', 'L01.224.230.260.550.500.750'], ['M01.848'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['I02.783.830', 'J03.832.830'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0

2889,Myopathy with anti-Jo-1 antibodies: pathology in perimysium and neighbouring muscle fibres.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate muscle pathology and clinical characteristics in patients with a myopathy and serum antibodies to the Jo-1 antigen (histidyl t-RNA synthetase).BACKGROUND: Anti-Jo-1 antibodies occur in syndromes that may include muscle weakness and pain, Raynaud's phenomenon, interstitial lung disease, arthritis, and a skin rash different from that seen in dermatomyositis. The muscle pathology is not well defined.METHODS: Case series. Review of charts, muscle biopsies, and laboratory records. Features of myopathology in 11 patients with anti-Jo-1 antibody associated myopathies were compared with other types of inflammatory myopathies.RESULTS: Myopathology in patients with anti-Jo-1 antibodies consistently included fragmentation of, and macrophage predominant inflammation in, perimysial connective tissue. Perifascicular myopathic changes, including atrophy, regenerating muscle fibres, and some muscle fibre necrosis, were most common in regions near the connective tissue pathology and were most prominent in patients with more severe weakness. Unlike many other inflammatory myopathies, inflammation in endomysial and perivascular regions was uncommon. By contrast with dermatomyositis, capillary density was normal.CONCLUSIONS: Myopathological changes in the anti-Jo-1 antibody syndrome include perimysial connective tissue fragmentation and inflammation, with muscle fibre pathology in neighbouring perifascicular regions. Myositis with anti-Jo-1 antibodies may result from an immune mediated disorder of connective tissue.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Autoantibodies', 'Female', 'Histidine-tRNA Ligase', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal', 'Muscular Diseases']",10727483,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.323', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.323', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.323'], ['D08.811.464.263.200.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['C23.550.470'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A10.690.552.500.500', 'A11.620.249'], ['C05.651', 'C10.668.491']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
3191,Novel guanidinylated bioresponsive poly(amidoamine)s designed for short hairpin RNA delivery.,"Two different disulfide (SS)-containing poly(amidoamine) (PAA) polymers were constructed using guanidino (Gua)-containing monomers (ie, arginine [Arg] and agmatine [Agm]) and N,N'-cystamine bisacrylamide (CBA) by Michael-addition polymerization. In order to characterize these two Gua-SS-PAA polymers and investigate their potentials as short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-delivery carriers, pSilencer 4.1-CMV FANCF shRNA was chosen as a model plasmid DNA to form complexes with these two polymers. The Gua-SS-PAAs and plasmid DNA complexes were determined with particle sizes less than 90 nm and positive æ-potentials under 20 mV at nucleic acid:polymer weight ratios lower than 1:24. Bioresponsive release of plasmid DNA was observed from both newly constructed complexes. Significantly lower cytotoxicity was observed for both polymer complexes compared with polyethylenimine and Lipofectamine 2000, two widely used transfection reagents as reference carriers. Arg-CBA showed higher transfection efficiency and gene-silencing efficiency in MCF7 cells than Agm-CBA and the reference carriers. In addition, the cellular uptake of Arg-CBA in MCF7 cells was found to be higher and faster than Agm-CBA and the reference carriers. Similarly, plasmid DNA transport into the nucleus mediated by Arg-CBA was more than that by Agm-CBA and the reference carriers. The study suggested that guanidine and carboxyl introduced into Gua-SS-PAAs polymers resulted in a better nuclear localization effect, which played a key role in the observed enhancement of transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity. Overall, two newly synthesized Gua-SS-PAAs polymers demonstrated great potential to be used as shRNA carriers for gene-therapy applications.","['Cell Survival', 'DNA', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group E Protein', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Particle Size', 'Plasmids', 'Polyamines', 'Polyethyleneimine', 'Polymerization', 'Polymers', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transfection']",27994462,"[['G04.346'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D12.776.313.843', 'D12.776.660.289'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.251.210.190.630'], ['E01.370.350.515.666.400', 'E05.595.666.400'], ['G02.712'], ['G05.360.600'], ['D02.092.782'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.550.600', 'D02.491.650', 'D05.750.716.507.600', 'D25.720.716.507.600', 'J01.637.051.720.716.507.600'], ['G02.750'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
45486,Effect of cimetidine and probenecid on pilsicainide renal clearance in humans.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of cimetidine and probenecid on the renal clearance of pilsicainide in healthy subjects.METHODS: Nine healthy men (age range, 21 to 38 years) were given oral doses of 50 mg pilsicainide hydrochloride alone, with coadministration of 800 mg oral cimetidine, or with coadministration of 1,500 mg oral probenecid on three occasions in a Latin-square order. Urine and venous blood samples were collected on a timely basis. The concentration of pilsicainide in plasma and urine were determined by an HPLC method.RESULTS: Concomitant administration of cimetidine significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of pilsicainide by a mean of 33%, prolonged elimination half-life by a mean of 24% (from 5 to 6.2 hours), reduced apparent oral clearance by a mean of 26% (from 14.7 +/- 0.1 to 10.8 +/- 0.8 L/h) and reduced renal clearance by a mean of 28% (from 196.8 +/- 53.9 to 141.8 +/- 25.9 mL/min). The net renal clearance by tubular secretion was significantly reduced by a mean value of 38%, from 151.4 +/- 62.9 to 93.0 +/- 31.1 mL/min. Coadministration of probenecid did not show any changes in plasma concentrations of pilsicainide, pharmacokinetics, or the net renal clearance by tubular secretion of pilsicainide.CONCLUSIONS: Pilsicainide appeared to be secreted by the active transport system for organic bases in the proximal tubule, and the excretion of pilsicainide was inhibited by cimetidine.","['Adult', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cimetidine', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Lidocaine', 'Male', 'Probenecid', 'Reference Values', 'Uricosuric Agents']",10741624,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.411.097'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D02.078.370.200', 'D03.383.129.308.130'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A05.810.453'], ['D02.065.199.092.500', 'D02.092.146.113.092.500'], ['D02.065.884.625', 'D02.886.590.700.625'], ['E05.978.810'], ['D27.505.954.329.337.900', 'D27.505.954.613.860']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

18710,Prevalence of vertebral fractures among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Canada.,"PURPOSE: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be at higher risk for osteoporosis. The primary objective of this case-control study was to determine the prevalence of vertebral fractures among patients with COPD admitted to acute care compared with a gender- and age-matched control group.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were identified by chart reviews from an acute care hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1999, including patients who were over 50 years old. In total, 127 patients with ICD-9 codes specifying COPD were randomly selected and compared with 127 gender- and age-matched controls. Chest radiographs were interpreted by two radiologists who defined and graded vertebral fractures using Genant's method. Medications taken, or prescribed at discharge, were recorded from charts.RESULTS: The overall prevalence of at least one vertebral fracture was found to be 34/127 (26.8%) in the COPD patients compared with 30/127 (23.6%) in the controls ( p=0.556). A significantly greater proportion of COPD patients had at least one severe vertebral fracture (OR=3.75, 95% CI 1.24 to 11.3). Review of hospital chest X-ray reports indicated that only 12 of 64 (18.8%) patients with vertebral fractures identified by the study radiologists actually had a vertebral fracture noted in the report. The proportion of COPD patients with vertebral fractures who were discharged on osteoporosis therapy was 5/27 (18.5%). There was a suggestion of lower lung function, as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC%), in patients with severe vertebral fractures ( p=0.067).CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that: (1) There is an increased proportion of COPD patients with severe vertebral fracture, and (2) Documentation and treatment of osteoporosis in acute care COPD patients is low. Therefore, there is a need to target this high-risk group for osteoporosis screening and potential clinical management.","['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Forced Expiratory Volume', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Humans', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'Spinal Fractures', 'Vital Capacity']",14551675,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E01.370.386.700.660.230', 'G09.772.650.430'], ['D06.472.040.543', 'D27.505.696.399.472.488'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.875.500', 'E05.944.600', 'N04.452.859.564.800.500', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.800.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['C05.116.198.579', 'C18.452.104.579'], ['C08.381.495.389'], ['C26.117.500.500', 'C26.404.812'], ['E01.370.386.700.485.750.900', 'G09.772.850.970']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Single-channel measurements reveal that a large proportion (82%) of Ca2+-release channels measured in slow-twitch muscle preparations have properties similar to those of the Ca2+-release channels of fast-twitch preparations, i.e. the same conductance, an identical sensitivity to caffeine and a bell-shaped Ca2+ activation curve for pCa (-log10[Ca2+]) 7 to 3. A low proportion (18%) of Ca2+-release channels observed in preparations from slow-twitch muscles were characterized by a very high activity level. These channels were not inhibited at a millimolar concentration of Ca2+. Our data suggest that the different properties of Ca2+ release in slow- and fast-twitch muscles might not be related to intrinsic properties of the Ca2+-release channels of each type of muscle but rather to the co-expression of two isoforms of ryanodine receptor and the lower amount of Ca2+-release channels expressed in slow- than in fast-twitch muscles.","['Animals', 'Caffeine', 'Calcium', 'Electrophysiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Muscle Fibers, Fast-Twitch', 'Muscle Fibers, Slow-Twitch', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum']",9644234,"[['B01.050'], ['D03.132.960.175', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824.175'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['E05.481'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.510.550'], ['A10.690.552.500.500.600', 'A11.620.249.400'], ['A10.690.552.500.500.700', 'A11.620.249.700'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.800', 'D12.776.210.500.800', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.800', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.800'], ['A10.690.552.500.500.850', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.248.310.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

39105,Mutational signatures of DNA mismatch repair deficiency in C. elegans,"Throughout their lifetime, cells are subject to extrinsic and intrinsic mutational processes leaving behind characteristic signatures in the genome. DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency leads to hypermutation and is found in different cancer types. Although it is possible to associate mutational signatures extracted from human cancers with possible mutational processes, the exact causation is often unknown. Here, we use C. elegans genome sequencing of pms-2 and mlh-1 knockouts to reveal the mutational patterns linked to C. elegans MMR deficiency and their dependency on endogenous replication errors and errors caused by deletion of the polymerase å subunit pole-4 Signature extraction from 215 human colorectal and 289 gastric adenocarcinomas revealed three MMR-associated signatures, one of which closely resembles the C. elegans MMR spectrum and strongly discriminates microsatellite stable and unstable tumors (AUC = 98%). A characteristic difference between human and C. elegans MMR deficiency is the lack of elevated levels of NCG > NTG mutations in C. elegans, likely caused by the absence of cytosine (CpG) methylation in worms. The other two human MMR signatures may reflect the interaction between MMR deficiency and other mutagenic processes, but their exact cause remains unknown. In summary, combining information from genetically defined models and cancer samples allows for better aligning mutational signatures to causal mutagenic processes.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'DNA Mismatch Repair', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'Humans', 'Mismatch Repair Endonuclease PMS2', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Mutation', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Stomach Neoplasms']",29636374,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['B01.050.500.500.294.400.875.660.250.250'], ['D12.776.419.500'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['G02.111.222.220', 'G05.219.220'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.308.300.230'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.074.766.250', 'D08.811.277.040.025.215.250', 'D08.811.277.352.335.350.600', 'D12.776.260.540.250'], ['D08.811.074.766.500', 'D08.811.277.040.025.215.500', 'D12.776.260.540.500'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D12.776.157.687', 'D12.776.660.720'], ['C04.588.274.476.767', 'C06.301.371.767', 'C06.405.249.767', 'C06.405.748.789']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

20789,Metabolic handling of 13C labelled tripalmitin in healthy controls and patients with cystic fibrosis.,"AIM: To examine the gastrointestinal handling and metabolic disposal of emulsified [1-13C]palmitic acid esterified into a triglyceride in nine healthy children and seven patients with cystic fibrosis on enzyme replacement treatment.METHODS: After an overnight fast, each child was given 10 mg/kg body weight [1,1,1-13C]tripalmitin with a standardised test meal of low natural 13C abundance. The total enrichment of 13C was measured using isotope ratio mass spectrometry in stool collected for a period of up to five days and in breath samples collected over a 24 hour period.RESULTS: The mean proportion of administered 13C label excreted in stool was 6% (range, 1-12.7%) in healthy children and 24.6% (range, 0-64%) in patients with cystic fibrosis. Healthy children excreted 31.3% of the administered label on their breath (range, 14.2-42.9%). Correcting the excretion of administered 13C label on the breath for differences in digestion and absorption in patients with cystic fibrosis increased the difference between individuals from 0-31.3% of administered dose (mean, 17.9%) to 0-49.1% of absorbed dose (mean, 23.2%) and was poorly related to the amount of 13C label in stool.CONCLUSION: Measurements of breath 13CO2 do not consistently reflect the gastrointestinal handling of emulsified 13C labelled tripalmitin because of differences in digestion and absorption in cystic fibrosis. Further studies need to examine whether ""breath tests"" alone can predict with confidence the gastrointestinal handling of other 13C labelled triglycerides and fatty acids.","['Breath Tests', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Digestive System', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Lipase', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Triglycerides']",9771251,"[['E01.370.100'], ['D01.268.150.075', 'D01.496.123'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C06.689.202', 'C08.381.187', 'C16.320.190', 'C16.614.213'], ['A03'], ['A12.459'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G03.015.500.374.500', 'G03.787.024.500.374.500', 'G07.203.650.372.500', 'G07.690.725.015.500.374.500', 'G10.261.353.500'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.400'], ['E05.196.566'], ['D10.351.801']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
44168,Organization of excitatory and inhibitory local networks in the caudal nucleus of tractus solitarius of rats revealed in in vitro slice preparation.,"Morphological and physiological properties of neurons in the caudal nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS) of rats were studied in vitro by whole-cell recording and intracellular staining with biocytin. Synaptic responses following the solitary tract stimulation were also investigated to elucidate anatomical substrates of the underlying local circuits. Biocytin-filled NTS cells were divided into three groups according to the pattern of their axonal arborization: (1) local circuit neurons whose axon collaterals were extensively distributed within the NTS with the main axons leaving the NTS; (2) presumed interneurons whose axon collaterals seemed to be restricted within the NTS; and (3) projection neurons whose axons had few, if any, collaterals. Both local circuit neurons and presumed interneurons had small cell bodies (< 150 microns2 in somal area) and exhibited tonic regular spiking at depolarized membrane potentials. Polysynaptic excitatory background activity was increased and lasted for 300-1000 msec in these neurons following solitary tract stimulation. The projection neurons had medium to large cell bodies (> 150 microns2 in somal area). Inhibitory postsynaptic responses produced by an increased CI-conductance were recorded in these projection neurons. These findings suggest that excitatory local networks are organized by an assembly of the local circuit neurons in the caudal NTS, and that the interneurons are arranged to connect the excitatory local network with medium to large projection neurons via inhibitory synapses. Visceral afferent information is probably processed in the highly organized excitatory and inhibitory local networks within the caudal NTS and conveyed to other brain regions.","['Afferent Pathways', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane', 'Central Nervous System', 'Electric Stimulation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Nerve Net', 'Neural Inhibition', 'Neurons', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Solitary Nucleus', 'Synaptic Transmission']",8889930,"[['A08.612.220'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.284.149'], ['A08.186'], ['E05.723.402'], ['E05.481'], ['A08.511'], ['G07.265.755', 'G11.561.616'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['E05.200.500.905', 'E05.242.800'], ['A08.800'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['A08.186.211.132.810.591.500.750'], ['G02.111.820.850', 'G04.835.850', 'G07.265.880', 'G11.561.830']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here we demonstrate the physical interaction between hsp70 (DnaK homologue) and hsp40 in human cells as determined by immunoprecipitation methods. Co-immunoprecipitation of hsp70 with hsp40 was dependent on the presence of ATP or unfolded protein (reduced carboxymethylated alpha-lactalbumin). A mutant type of tumor suppressor gene product, mtp53, was co-immunoprecipitated not only with hsp70 but also with hsp40.

8947,Scale-down of microalgae cultivations in tubular photo-bioreactors--a conceptual approach.,"Rational design of large-scale bioreactors is still suffering from inadequate scale-up of technical parameters from lab to large scale and from missing kinetic information concerning the physiological reactions of the specific strain under cultivation. Therefore, simulations of processes expected in large-scale have to be carried out as far as possible and experiments have to be performed in small-scale reactors mimicking the situation in large scale. This procedure is referred to as scale-down. In this paper a concept to accomplish this task is proposed. Firstly, interactions between light transfer, fluid dynamics, and microbial metabolism are described. Secondly, a procedure is given to decompose the interactions by simulation on the one hand and by finding physiological parameters in model reactors on the other. Light transfer can be calculated by Monte Carlo methods, while fluid dynamics is handled by CFD. Ideally illuminated model photo-bioreactors and pilot reactors with enforced flow field are proposed to measure physiological parameters especially induced by light/dark cycles generated by interaction of turbulences and light attenuation.","['Bioreactors', 'Equipment Design', 'Light', 'Models, Biological', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Photobiology', 'Porphyridium']",17561299,"[['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['E05.320'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E05.318.740.525', 'L01.906.394.422', 'N05.715.360.750.540', 'N06.850.520.830.525'], ['H01.158.273.738'], ['B01.650.700.610']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0
12763,Salicylate as an in vivo free radical trap: studies on ischemic insult to the rat intestine.,"Ischemia of rat intestine was induced in vivo by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) for 15 min. Sodium salicylate, 100 mg/kg, given IP, 30 min prior to the ischemic event served as a specific trap for hydroxyl radicals. Portions of the bowel were sequentially isolated and removed--2 min prior to ischemia, 2 min prior to declamping of the SMA, and 10 min following reperfusion. The bowel segments were homogenized in 3% TCA. The homogenate was centrifuged and filtrated through a 0.22 mu filter. The hydroxylation products of salicylate, dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) derivatives, were isolated, identified, and quantified by HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection (ECD). The level of 2,5-DHBA (M +/- SE, ng/g tissue) in the preischemic bowel (N = 21) was 241.8 +/- 10.0. In the ischemic specimen the level of 2,5-DHBA increased significantly to 313.3 +/- 15.5 (p = 0.0129), and remained unchanged in the reperfusion period (322.8 +/- 15.5). The histological examination correlated well with these levels: mild villi damage in the ischemic period with no further exacerbation during the reperfusion period. This study in an in vivo animal model of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion provides direct evidence for the involvement of free radicals during the ischemic insult.","['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Free Radicals', 'Gentisates', 'Hydroxides', 'Hydroxybenzoates', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Intestines', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Salicylates', 'Salicylic Acid']",1646748,"[['B01.050'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['D01.339', 'D02.389'], ['D02.241.223.100.300.595.405', 'D02.241.511.390.595.405', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.281.595.405', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595.405'], ['D01.045.250', 'D01.248.497.158.459'], ['D02.241.223.100.300', 'D02.241.511.390', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.281', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.410'], ['D01.045.250.357', 'D01.248.497.158.459.300', 'D01.339.431.249'], ['A03.556.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['C14.907.725', 'C23.550.767.877'], ['D02.241.223.100.300.595', 'D02.241.511.390.595', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.281.595', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595'], ['D02.241.223.100.300.595.608', 'D02.241.511.390.595.608', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.281.595.608', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595.608']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41568,"Radiation response of mouse lymphoid and myeloid cell lines. Part I. Sensitivity to killing by ionizing radiation, rate of loss of viability, and cell type of origin.","The sensitivity of 10 mouse lymphoid or myeloid cell lines to gamma-ray- and DNA-associated 125I-decay-induced clonogenic cell killing have been compared with their rate of loss of viability (membrane integrity) and with their putative cell type of origin. The pseudodiploid haematopoietic cell lines showed D0 values for 125I-induced DNA double-strand breakage (dsb) that ranged from 7.7 +/- 0.7 to 40.8 +/- 2.8 decays. These lines generally appeared to be more sensitive to killing by radiation-induced DNA dsb than are fibroblast-like cell lines. The increased sensitivity of haematopoietic cell lines to killing by DNA dsb may be related to their mode of death (apoptosis versus necrosis). Mode of cell death may thus be an important factor in determining the 'inherent radiosensitivity' of normal cells/tissues. Haematopoietic cell lines that undergo rapid interphase apoptotic death showed extreme sensitivity to DNA dsb. The latter cell lines were found to have derived from immature lymphoid cells, and it is speculated that their high radiosensitivity might reflect the action of a mechanism that normally eliminates cells containing illegitimate V(D)J recombinase-induced DNA dsb.","['Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Damage', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta']",7907118,"[['B01.050'], ['A15.382.216'], ['G04.346'], ['G05.200'], ['G01.358.500.505.300', 'G01.750.250.300', 'G01.750.750.400'], ['G05.344.801', 'G12.500.287'], ['E01.370.225.812.447', 'E05.200.812.447', 'E05.478.594.450'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.500'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.816.824.825']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The purpose of this study is to characterize the reduction mammoplasty patient population which would further assist in planning the future workforce needs. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for 2007, a ÷ analysis of female in-patients treated with reduction mammoplasty for breast hypertrophy was performed to identify significant differences in race and payer mix. Of 8394 female in-patients with breast hypertrophy, 61% were treated with reduction mammoplasty. Black and Hispanic patients (P < 0.0001) and patients with private insurance (P < 0.0001) were more likely to undergo reduction mammoplasty. This study demonstrates racial and socioeconomic disparities in breast reduction in the United States in 2007.

This method reproducibly provides a well-oriented tissue block that can be sectioned with minimal effort by a non-expert, and also allows retroactive analysis of samples collected on slides for light microscopy.","['Animals', 'Cryoultramicrotomy', 'Histocytological Preparation Techniques', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Retina', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Xenopus laevis']",26008144,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.530.160', 'E01.370.225.750.600.530.160', 'E05.200.500.620.530.160', 'E05.200.750.600.530.160'], ['E01.370.225.500.620', 'E01.370.225.750.600', 'E05.200.500.620', 'E05.200.750.600'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.580', 'E05.595.402.580'], ['A09.371.729'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.440', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.440', 'E05.200.500.620.760.440', 'E05.200.750.600.760.440'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.720', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.720', 'E05.200.500.620.760.720', 'E05.200.750.600.760.720'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.610.500.562']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
35081,Thermodynamic characterization of the multivalent binding of chartreusin to DNA.,"Characterization of the thermodynamics of DNA- drug interactions is a very useful part in rational drug design. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and UV melting experiments have been used to analyze the multivalent (intercalation plus minor groove) binding of the antitumor antibiotic chartreusin to DNA. Using DNA UV melting studies in the presence of the ligand and the binding enthalpy determined by ITC, we determined that the binding constant for the interaction was 3.6 x 10(5) M(-1) at 20 degrees C, in a solution containing 18 mM Na(+). The DNA-drug interaction was enthalpy driven, with a DeltaH(b) of -7.07 kcal/mol at 20 degrees C. Binding enthalpies were determined by ITC in the 20-35 degrees C range and used to calculate a binding-induced change in heat capacity (DeltaCp) of -391 cal/mol K. We have obtained a detailed thermodynamic profile for the interaction of this multivalent drug, which makes possible a dissection of DeltaG(obs) into the component free energy terms. The hydrophobic transfer of the chartreusin chromophore from the solution to the DNA intercalating site is the main contributor to the free energy of binding.","['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Benzopyrans', 'Calorimetry', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'DNA', 'Glycosides', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Salmon', 'Sodium', 'Thermodynamics']",12384604,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248.106'], ['D03.383.663.283', 'D03.633.100.150'], ['E05.196.131'], ['E05.196.131.310', 'E05.196.370.310'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D09.408'], ['G02.409'], ['E05.393.640', 'G02.111.603', 'G05.627'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.817.750.705'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['G01.906']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25783,Small molecule-based chemotherapeutic approach in p16-positive and -negative HNSCC in vitro.,"BACKGROUND: Incidence of oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) induced by the human papilloma virus (HPV) is rising. HNSCC is the sixth most common neoplasia worldwide. The survival rate remains poor, thus innovative therapy approaches are necessary. Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, as well as the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib (targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor and RAF) and sunitinib (targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, stem cell factor receptor, RET proto-oncogene and colony-stimulating factor), have shown a remarkable antitumor effect against various tumor entities, with moderate side-effects. These drugs are administered orally, which should lead to higher patient compliance and less hospitalisation.AIM: This study sought to evaluate the expression of PDGFR á/â and hypoxia-inducible factor-1á (HIF-1á) and their alterations induced by everolimus, sorafenib and sunitinib in chemona?ve HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC. To our knowledge, this is the first in vitro study to investigate such cases.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We incubated HPV-positive CERV196 and HPV-negative HNSCC 11A and 14C cells for 2 to 8 days with increasing concentration of drugs. Expression of PDGFR á/â and HIF-1á was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared to a chemona?ve controls.RESULTS: Our study showed that PDGFR á/â and HIF-1á were expressed in all three cell lines. Incubation with everolimus, sorafenib or sunitinib led to a decrease in PDGFR á/â and HIF-1á expression, depending on the HPV status. A statistically significant alteration of PDGFR á/â was detected in CERV196 only. Thus, HPV-positive HNSCC exhibited a higher sensitivity to the drugs used compared to HPV-negative HNSCC 11A and 14C tumor cells. A significant reduction of HIF-1á was measured for HNSCC 11A and 14C only. An escalation of drug concentration had no significant effect.CONCLUSION: We showed that these novel agents led to a significant reduction of PDGFR and HIF-1á, depending on the HPV status. HPV positivity is associated with increased chemosensitivity and may be associated with better locoregional control and overall patient survival compared to HPV negativity. Further studies are necessary to investigate the efficacy and safety of these agents in the treatment of HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC in vivo.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Human papillomavirus 16', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta', 'Small Molecule Libraries']",24324073,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['C04.588.894.797.520.109.220.249', 'C08.381.540.140.500', 'C08.785.520.100.220.500'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['B04.280.210.655.050.616', 'B04.613.204.655.050.616'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.260.103.625.750', 'D12.776.930.125.625.750'], ['E05.481'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.900.500', 'D12.776.543.750.630.625.300', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.630.300'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.900.750', 'D12.776.543.750.630.625.400', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.630.400'], ['D27.720.470.765']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
43673,A Physician's Recommendation for Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: What Makes African-American Mothers Compliant?,"BACKGROUND: Improving human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among African-American (AA) female adolescents to reduce the cervical cancer burden is important and cost-effective. The study objective is to identify factors most influential to AA mothers' likelihood to comply with a physician's recommendation to get their daughters the HPV vaccine.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey. Participants were recruited through online and community sites (ie, schools, community centers, etc.) in Alabama. A total of 280 AA mothers and their adolescent daughters completed the survey. A binary logistic regression was used to determine factors influencing mother's likelihood to adhere with a physician's recommendation to get their daughters the HPV vaccine.RESULTS: The most significant factors influencing mother's likelihood to comply with physician's recommendation were culture: future-time orientation (P = 0.001), perceived barriers of HPV vaccination (P = 0.007), perceived susceptibility to HPV (P = 0.047) and perceived benefits of HPV vaccination (P = 0.002). Further exploration of perceived barriers and perceived benefits found mother's perception that the HPV vaccine is a good way to protect my daughter's health as the only significant benefit. No measures of perceived barriers were significant.CONCLUSIONS: A physician's recommendation should advise AA mothers on the risk of HPV and the importance of HPV vaccination at an early age to reduce cervical cancer risk. It should further address mothers' perceived disadvantages of HPV vaccination (eg, side effects). Incorporating this information in physician recommendation practices could increase HPV vaccination rates with implications in reducing the cervical cancer burden among this high-risk population.","['African Americans', 'Alabama', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Mothers', 'Papillomavirus Infections', 'Papillomavirus Vaccines', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Physicians', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms', 'Vaccination']",29329167,"[['M01.686.508.100.100', 'M01.686.754.100'], ['Z01.107.567.875.075.100', 'Z01.107.567.875.750.100'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.263.500.320.200', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340.270', 'M01.620.630'], ['C01.925.256.650', 'C01.925.928.725'], ['D20.215.894.899.498'], ['F01.100.150.750.500', 'F01.145.488.887.500', 'N05.300.150.800.500'], ['M01.526.485.810', 'N02.360.810'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.850', 'C13.351.500.852.593.131', 'C13.351.500.852.762.850', 'C13.351.937.418.875.850'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.530.890', 'E05.478.550.600.890', 'N02.421.726.758.310.890', 'N06.850.780.200.425.900', 'N06.850.780.680.310.890']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

49852,Gene flow in Dubautia arborea and D. ciliolata: the roles of ecology and isolation by distance in maintaining species boundaries despite ongoing hybridization.,"The relative roles of gene flow and natural selection in maintaining species differentiation have been a subject of debate for some time. The traditional view is that gene flow constrains adaptive divergence and maintains species cohesiveness. Alternatively, ecological speciation posits that the reverse is true: that adaptive ecological differentiation constrains gene flow. In this study, we examine gene flow and population differentiation among populations of two species of the Hawaiian silversword alliance, Dubautia arborea and D. ciliolata. We compare divergence in putatively neutral microsatellite markers with divergence in leaf morphometric traits, which may be selectively important or physiologically linked to selectively important traits. Gene flow between populations was found to be significant in only one of the two species, D. arborea. Leaf morphometric differentiation between species was significant, though not among populations within species. No evidence of effective genetic introgression was observed between apparently 'pure' populations of these species. Gene flow as measured by microsatellites was not correlated with geographic distance between populations, but was correlated with the linear placement of the widest part of the leaf. Because these two species are interfertile, as demonstrated by the presence of active hybrid zone, the lack of genetic introgression and the maintenance of species boundaries may be associated with natural selection on differential habitat.","['Adaptation, Biological', 'Asteraceae', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Flow', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Plant Leaves', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Species Specificity']",17894757,"[['G16.012'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.100'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['G05.330.159'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['E05.820.150.390', 'G05.090.390'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.340.024.850.500'], ['A18.024.812'], ['G05.783'], ['G16.824']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
35426,Reversal in the relationship between species richness and turnover in a phytoplankton community.,"Negative relationships between species richness and the rate of compositional turnover are common, suggesting that diverse communities have greater stability than depauperate ones; however, the mechanistic basis for this pattern is still widely debated. Species richness and turnover can covary either because they are mechanistically linked or because they share common environmental drivers. Few empirical studies have combined long-term changes in community composition with multiple drivers of environmental change, and so little is known about how the underlying mechanisms of species coexistence interact with changes in the mean and variability of environmental conditions. Here, we use a 33 year long time series (1976-2008) of phytoplankton community composition from Lake Zurich, to examine how environmental variation influences the relationship between richness and annual turnover. We find that the relationship between richness and annual turnover reverses midway through the time series (1992-1993), leading to a hump-shaped relationship between species richness and annual turnover. Using structural equation modeling we show that annual turnover and diversity are independently associated with different drivers of environmental change. Furthermore, we find that the observed annual sequences of community assembly give rise to rates of species accumulation that are more heterogeneous through time than expected by chance, likely owing to a high proportion of species showing significant autocorrelation and to strong positive covariation in the occurrences of species.","['Biodiversity', 'Lakes', 'Phytoplankton', 'Population Dynamics', 'Switzerland', 'Time Factors']",23236914,"[['G16.500.275.157.049', 'N06.230.124.049'], ['G01.311.580', 'G16.500.275.280.500', 'N06.230.232.500'], ['B05.080.500.600'], ['I01.240.600', 'N01.224.625', 'N06.850.505.400.700'], ['Z01.542.883'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

49365,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition events during human embryonic stem cell differentiation.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs during embryonic development and may also be associated with the metastatic spread of epithelial tumors. During EMT, E-cadherin is down-regulated and this correlates with increased motility and invasion of cells. We show that differentiation of human embryonic stem (ES) cells in monolayer culture is associated with an E- to N-cadherin switch, increased vimentin expression, up-regulation of E-cadherin repressor molecules (Snail and Slug proteins), and increased gelatinase (matrix metalloproteinases; MMP-2 and MMP-9) activity and cellular motility, all characteristic EMT events. The 5T4 oncofetal antigen, previously shown to be associated with early human ES cell differentiation, is also part of this process. Abrogation of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact in undifferentiated ES cells using neutralizing antibody (nAb) SHE78.7 resulted in increased cellular motility, altered actin cytoskeleton arrangement and a mesenchymal phenotype together with presentation of the 5T4 antigen at the cell surface. nAb-treated ES cells remained in an undifferentiated state, as assessed by OCT-4 protein expression, and did not express EMT-associated transcripts. Removal of nAb from ES cells resulted in the restoration of cell-cell contact, absence of cell surface 5T4, decreased mesenchymal cellular morphology and motility, and enabled the differentiation of the cells to the three germ layers upon their removal from the fibroblast feeder layer. We conclude that E-cadherin functions in human ES cells to stabilize the cortical actin cyoskeletal arrangement and this prevents cell surface localization of the 5T4 antigen. Furthermore, human ES cells represent a useful model system with which to study EMT events relevant to embryonic development and tumor cell metastasis.","['Actins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mesoderm', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors', 'Vimentin']",18056451,"[['D05.750.078.730.250', 'D12.776.210.500.100', 'D12.776.220.525.255'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200.200', 'D23.050.301.350.200'], ['G04.152'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['A11.251'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750'], ['A11.872.700.250'], ['A10.272'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.525', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.525'], ['D12.776.395.550', 'D12.776.543.550'], ['A16.504.660'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['D12.776.930.815'], ['D12.776.930'], ['D05.750.078.593.900', 'D12.776.220.475.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
49442,Angiotensin II induces apoptosis in rat glomerular epithelial cells.,"ANG II has been shown to modulate kidney cell growth and contribute to the pathobiology of glomerulosclerosis. Glomerular visceral epithelial cell (GEC) injury or loss is considered to play a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of glomerulosclerosis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ANG II on GEC apoptosis. Rat GECs were incubated with increasing doses of ANG II for variable time periods. Apoptosis was evaluated by cell nucleus staining and DNA fragmentation assay. ANG II induced GEC apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The proapoptotic effect was attenuated by the ANG II receptor type 1 antagonist losartan or the ANG II receptor type 2 antagonist PD-123319 and was completely blocked by incubation with the combined antagonists. Moreover, ANG II stimulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 production as measured by ELISA. GECs exposed to TGF-beta1 demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent increase in apoptosis. ANG II-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by addition of anti-TGF-beta1 antibody. ANG II also upregulated the expression of Fas, FasL, and Bax and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 in GECs. These studies suggest that ANG II induces GEC apoptosis by a mechanism involving TGF-beta1 expression that may, importantly, contribute to the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis.","['Angiotensin II', 'Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Imidazoles', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Losartan', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Pyridines', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2', 'Receptors, Angiotensin', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'fas Receptor']",12060599,"[['D06.472.699.094.078', 'D12.644.400.070.078', 'D12.644.456.073.041', 'D12.644.548.058.078', 'D12.776.631.650.070.078', 'D23.469.050.050.050'], ['D27.505.519.162'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114'], ['D27.505.954.411.162'], ['A11.251'], ['G05.200.230'], ['A11.436'], ['D12.644.276.374.750.249', 'D12.776.395.550.312', 'D12.776.467.374.750.249', 'D12.776.543.550.312', 'D23.529.374.750.249'], ['D03.383.129.308'], ['A05.810.453.324.359', 'A05.810.453.736.520'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.185.475', 'D03.383.129.308.507', 'D03.383.129.617.467'], ['D12.776.395.550', 'D12.776.543.550'], ['D12.776.624.664.700'], ['D12.644.360.075.718', 'D12.776.476.075.718', 'D12.776.624.664.700.169'], ['D03.383.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.047.625', 'D12.776.543.750.750.130.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.047.687', 'D12.776.543.750.750.130.875'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.047', 'D12.776.543.750.750.130'], ['D12.644.276.374.687', 'D12.644.276.954.775', 'D12.776.467.374.687', 'D12.776.467.942.775', 'D23.529.374.687', 'D23.529.942.775'], ['D12.644.276.374.687.100', 'D12.644.276.954.775.100', 'D12.776.467.374.687.100', 'D12.776.467.942.775.100', 'D23.529.374.687.100', 'D23.529.942.775.100'], ['D27.505.954.411.793'], ['D12.644.360.075.718.400', 'D12.776.476.075.718.400'], ['D12.776.543.750.690.500', 'D12.776.543.750.705.852.760.195']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
10382,Graves' disease in pregnancy: prospective evaluation of a selective invasive treatment protocol.,"OBJECTIVE: Graves' disease in pregnancy carries a risk of fetal thyrotoxicosis from the transplacental transfer of thyroid-stimulating antibodies or fetal hypothyroidism from transplacental transfer of antithyroid drugs and thyroid-blocking antibodies.STUDY DESIGN: From 1991 through 2002, all pregnant women with Graves' disease underwent follow-up evaluations that included serial thyroid-stimulating antibody level, thyroid function, and ultrasound examinations. Umbilical blood sampling was recommended if the thyroid-stimulating antibody level was abnormally high or if fetal tachycardia, goiter, intrauterine growth retardation, or hydrops were present. For fetal hyperthyroidism, the mother received antithyroid drugs; for fetal hypothyroidism, maternal antithyroid treatment was reduced, and thyroxine was injected into the amniotic sac.RESULTS: Of 40000 deliveries, 24 pregnancies (26 fetuses) occurred in 18 women with Graves' disease. Nine of 14 mothers with positive findings elected umbilical blood sampling. In 4 of the mothers, the results were normal. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were diagnosed in 2 and 3 fetuses, respectively. All the fetuses were treated successfully by the protocol with up to four repeated umbilical blood samplings. No complications were recorded in any of the 20 umbilical blood sampling. In the 5 patients who had only elevated thyroid-stimulating antibody levels and who did not elect umbilical blood sampling, sonographic findings remained normal up to term, and the newborn infants were normal. One of 12 children (in whose case we did not recommend umbilical blood sampling) was born with transient hypothyroidism caused by maternal propylthiouracil treatment. All children, whose cases were followed for up to 9 years, are normal.CONCLUSION: In women with Graves' disease, umbilical blood sampling in selected cases may improve the control of fetal thyroid function.","['Amniotic Fluid', 'Antithyroid Agents', 'Autoantibodies', 'Blood Specimen Collection', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graves Disease', 'Humans', 'Hyperthyroidism', 'Hypothyroidism', 'Immunoglobulins, Thyroid-Stimulating', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Receptors, Thyrotropin', 'Thyrotropin', 'Thyroxine', 'Ultrasonography, Prenatal']",12861156,"[['A12.098', 'A16.378.149'], ['D06.347.100', 'D27.505.696.399.450.100'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.323', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.323', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.323'], ['E01.370.225.998.110', 'E04.665.150', 'E05.200.998.110'], ['A12.207.152.200', 'A15.145.300', 'A16.378.200'], ['C13.703.277', 'C16.300'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C11.675.349.500', 'C19.874.283.605', 'C19.874.397.370', 'C20.111.555'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C19.874.397'], ['C19.874.482'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.323.480', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.323.480', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.323.480'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C13.703'], ['D12.776.543.750.720.600.850', 'D12.776.543.750.750.555.850', 'D12.776.543.750.750.660.825'], ['D06.472.699.631.525.883', 'D12.644.548.691.525.883'], ['D06.472.931.812', 'D12.125.072.050.767'], ['E01.370.350.850.865', 'E01.370.378.630.865']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
21199,Ceftaroline Activity Tested Against Bacterial Isolates Causing Community-acquired Respiratory Tract Infections and Skin and Skin Structure Infections in Pediatric Patients From United States Hospitals: 2012-2014.,"Ceftaroline fosamil has recently received US Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of acute bacterial skin/skin structure infections (SSSIs), including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia for pediatric patients ?2 months old. We evaluated the potency and spectrum of ceftaroline and comparators when tested against community-acquired respiratory tract infection (CARTI) and SSSI pathogens from pediatric patients. A total of 3141 consecutive, unique pediatric patient isolates of clinical significance (1460 CARTI and 1681 SSSI isolates) were collected from 29 US medical centers and tested for susceptibility to ceftaroline and comparators by broth microdilution methods. The organism collection included Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 754), Haemophilus influenzae (487), S. aureus (1399), â-hemolytic streptococci (214), Enterobacteriaceae (112), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (58), Klebsiella spp. (39), Escherichia coli (26) and miscellaneous other bacteria (52). Susceptibility results were analyzed according to patient age as follows: ?1, 2-5, 6-12 and 13-17 years old. Overall, 99%-100% of Gram-positive isolates and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute clinical breakpoint criteria. Ceftaroline exhibited potent in vitro activity against bacterial pathogens from CARTI and SSSI recently (2012-2014) collected from pediatric patients in US medical centers. Ceftaroline was particularly active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus from SSSI ([minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% and 90% of isolates (MIC50/90,)] and ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae from CARTI (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 ìg/mL; 98.3% susceptible).","['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Cephalosporins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Enterobacteriaceae Infections', 'Female', 'Haemophilus influenzae', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases, Bacterial', 'Staphylococcal Infections', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'United States']",28403050,"[['M01.060.057'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['D02.065.589.099.249', 'D02.886.665.074', 'D03.633.100.300.249'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C01.234'], ['B03.440.450.425', 'B03.660.250.150'], ['C01.150.252.400.310'], ['B03.440.450.600.450.330', 'B03.660.250.550.290.330'], ['N02.278.421'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['B03.300.390.400.800.750.100.500', 'B03.353.500.750.750.100.500', 'B03.510.100.750.750.100.500', 'B03.510.400.790.750.100.500'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625.100', 'B03.660.250.580.590.050'], ['C01.748', 'C08.730'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C01.150.252.819', 'C01.800.720', 'C17.800.838.765'], ['C01.150.252.410.868'], ['B03.353.750.737.872.550', 'B03.510.400.800.872.550', 'B03.510.550.737.872.550'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
28690,"Hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia and obesity in middle-aged Finns with impaired glucose tolerance.","The aim of the study was to analyse the data obtained from a 2-year follow-up study of middle-aged Finnish subjects (n = 183) with a previous history of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in order to elucidate the longitudinal relationships between hypertension, fasting hyperinsulinaemia and obesity. Hypertension was defined as either a systolic blood pressure (BP) of > or =160 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of > or =95 mm Hg or being on anti-hypertensive medication regardless of the BP value. Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for glucose tolerance status, serum lipids, exercise behaviour and alcohol consumption shows that the odds ratios of one unit (mU/l) increase in the baseline fasting insulin concentration were 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.00-1.28) for the 2-year incidence of hypertension in subjects with IGT at baseline. Baseline body mass index (BMI) also predicted the 2-year incidence of hypertension, with an odds ratio of 1.20 (95% CI 1.02-1.42). BMI correlated positively with fasting insulin level (r = 0.54, P < 0.001). It is concluded that an elevated fasting insulin concentration as well as an increased BMI preceded the onset of hypertension in subjects with IGT. It may suggest a causal relationship between hypertension and hyperinsulinaemia.","['Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Glucose Intolerance', 'Humans', 'Hyperinsulinism', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity', 'Odds Ratio']",9607697,"[['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['C18.452.394.952.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452.394.968'], ['C14.907.489'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
10707,Protein kinase B alpha/Akt1 regulates placental development and fetal growth.,"Protein kinase B alpha (PKB alpha/Akt1) is implicated in the regulation of metabolism, transcription, cell survival, angiogenesis, cell migration, growth, and tumorigenesis. Previously, it was reported that PKB alpha-deficient mice are small with increased neonatal mortality (Cho, H., Thorvaldsen, J. L., Chu, Q., Feng, F., and Birnbaum, M. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 38349-38352 and Chen, W. S., Xu, P. Z., Gottlob, K., Chen, M. L., Sokol, K., Shiyanova, T., Roninson, I., Wenig, W., Suzuki, R., Tobe, K., Kadowaki, T., and Hay, N. (2001) Genes Dev. 15, 2203-2208). Here we show that PKB alpha is widely expressed in placenta including all types of trophoblast and vascular endothelial cells. Pkb alpha-/- placentae display significant hypotrophy, with marked reduction of the decidual basalis and nearly complete loss of glycogen-containing cells in the spongiotrophoblast, and exhibit decreased vascularization. Pkb alpha-/- placentae also show significant reduction of phosphorylation of PKB and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase.

719,[Neuroimaging diagnosis and therapeutic efficacy of different surgical methods of gliomatosis cerebri].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the neuroimaging diagnosis and therapeutic efficacy of different surgical methods of gliomatosis cerebri.METHODS: 26 cases of gliomatosis cerebri at our department between September 2008 and September 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative cranial computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other multimodal imaging scans were performed. The procedures included stereotactic brain biopsy (n = 11) and large craniotomy lobotomy (n = 15). Whole brain radiotherapy and/or temozolomide therapy was performed postoperatively according to the malignancy of tumors. Follow-ups were conducted to analyze the survival differences between stereotactic brain biopsy and large craniotomy lobotomy groups.RESULTS: According to the different features of multimodal imaging, gliomatosis cerebri could be divided into two types: (1) type I(n = 19) showed a diffuse infiltrating lesion infringing multiple brain lobes or regions with central corpus callosum but without obvious enhancement; (2) type II (n = 7) appeared as sporadic or tuberous enhancement in addition to the features of type I. Pathological diagnosis: pilocytic astrocytoma (n = 2), diffuse astrocytoma (n = 13), oligodendroglial tumors (n = 3), oligoastrocytoma (n = 1), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 5) and glioblastoma (n = 2). The degree of malignancy was a prognostic factor for postoperative survival in patients with gliomatosis cerebri. The mean survival time (MST) of large craniotomy lobotomy group (23 ± 7) was significantly longer than that of stereotactic brain biopsy group (13 ± 3) (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Gliomatosis cerebri is a primary brain glial tumor with diffuse infiltrative growth but retaining the general structure of central nervous system. Multimodal imaging studies plus pathological examination yield a definitive diagnosis. Comprehensive treatment of operation plus chemo- or radio-therapy can prolong postoperative MST.","['Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Glioma', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neuroimaging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",25152287,"[['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C04.588.614.250.195', 'C10.228.140.211', 'C10.551.240.250'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.380', 'C04.557.470.670.380', 'C04.557.580.625.600.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['E01.370.350.578', 'E01.370.376.537', 'E05.629'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
24366,The effects of acute cocaine administration on the DOI-induced head-twitch response in reserpinized mice.,"Previously it was shown that acute cocaine administration dose dependently reduces the 5-HT2-receptor-mediated DOI [(+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane]-induced head-twitch response (HTR) in mice via indirect stimulation of the inhibitory adrenergic alpha 2- and serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors. In addition, the inhibitory capacity of cocaine was enhanced fourfold in mice with 5-HT2-receptor supersensitivity induced by a single injection of DOI 48 h prior to experimentation. The aim of the present investigation was to determine the inhibitory capacity of cocaine in reserpinized mice. A single injection of reserpine 48 h prior to DOI administration caused supersensitivity in the DOI-induced HTR. Two reserpine injections did not further enhance this supersensitivity effect. Once reserpinized 5-HT2-receptor supersensitive animals were less responsive to the inhibitory effects of cocaine on the DOI-induced behavior than were the mice, as reported previously, that were made supersensitive by DOI pretreatment. The inhibitory capacity of cocaine was further attenuated when mice were reserpinized twice prior to determination of its effects on the DOI-induced behavior. Taken together with previously published data, the present investigation lends further support for the importance of endogenous levels of 5-HT and norepinephrine on the ability of cocaine to attenuate the DOI-induced HTR.","['Amphetamines', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Cocaine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Norepinephrine', 'Reserpine', 'Serotonin', 'Serotonin Receptor Agonists']",7816879,"[['D02.092.471.683.152'], ['B01.050'], ['F01.145.113'], ['D02.145.074.722.388', 'D03.132.889.354', 'D03.605.084.500.722.388', 'D03.605.869.388'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.510', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.510'], ['D02.033.100.291.502', 'D02.092.063.480', 'D02.092.211.215.746', 'D02.092.311.830', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.830'], ['D03.132.436.681.933.500', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.933.500', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.933.500'], ['D02.092.211.215.801.852', 'D03.633.100.473.914.814', 'D23.469.050.650'], ['D27.505.519.625.850.800', 'D27.505.696.577.850.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
40510,Divergent patterns of allelic alterations in premalignant laryngeal lesions indicate differences in the impact of morphological grading characteristics.,"OBJECTIVES: Classic histological grading and molecular genetic analysis of epithelial hyperplastic laryngeal lesions (EHLL) were correlated in an attempt to elucidate, which classic marker reflects best the gradual progression of laryngeal premalignant lesions as determined by an increasing number of molecular genetic aberrations.METHODS: Thirty-two EHLL were grouped according to four grades of nuclear atypia, four degrees of epithelial maturation and three groups of overall and suprabasal mitotic activity. Overall and suprabasal proliferative activity were measured by MIB-1 immunostaining and staged according to four levels. Allelic imbalance was determined by PCR using 32 microsatellite loci at nine chromosomal arms.RESULTS: Of the six classic criteria, only progressive mitotic indices correlated with allelic alterations in a remarkable variety of microsatellite markers, especially at chromosome 17p.CONCLUSION: Using the number of allelic alterations as standard for assessment, this preliminary study gives first evidence that certain morphological criteria could reflect differently the gradual progression of premalignant laryngeal lesions with mitotic index being the most promising marker. Further studies with long-term follow-up are required to prove the predictive value of these criteria in daily practice.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allelic Imbalance', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Laryngeal Diseases', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms', 'Larynx', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",15713999,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G05.365.590.029'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.323.204', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.323.204', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.323.204'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['C04.697.098.500', 'C23.550.727.098.500'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.415.425', 'G05.360.162.520.300.415.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.444'], ['C08.360', 'C09.400'], ['C04.588.443.665.481', 'C08.360.369', 'C08.785.481', 'C09.400.369', 'C09.647.481'], ['A04.329'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.340.024.850.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.393.620.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
45106,Quantitative evaluation of 2 x 2 arrays of Lucite cone applicators in flat layered phantoms using Gaussian-beam-predicted and thermographically measured SAR distributions.,"SAR distributions from four different E-field-orientated 2 x 2 arrays of incoherently driven Lucite cone applicators (LCAs) were investigated. The LCAs operated at 433 MHz with an aperture of 10.5 cm x 10.5 cm each. Two techniques were used to obtain SAR distributions in flat layered phantoms: Gaussian beam (GB) predictions and thermographical (TG) imaging. The GB predictions showed that the effective field size of the different array configurations varied by up to 3%. The TG-measured SAR distribution showed significant deviations from the GB-predicted SAR distributions (maximum 34.6%). The difference between GB-predicted and TG-measured SAR levels (averaged per 10% GB-predicted SAR intervals) equalled less than 11.3% for the parallel E-field orientated array and respectively 15.1% for the clockwise-orientated array. When antennae in the clockwise-orientated array were more widely spread (array aperture 23 cm x 23 cm) in order to diminish their mutual interactions, these differences decreased to 12.4%. However, the overall difference within the 50% SAR or higher range decreased from 14% to 9%. The results lead us to conclude that LCAs can be used clinically and their antenna interactions are not considered to be a problem under clinical conditions.","['Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Polymethyl Methacrylate', 'Thermography']",9725599,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.565'], ['E05.599'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['E07.671'], ['D02.241.081.069.800.550.500', 'D05.750.716.822.111.650.605.500', 'D25.720.716.822.111.650.605.500', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.111.650.605.500'], ['E01.370.350.800', 'E05.933.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The current healthcare climate tends to focus on individuals as the cause of errors rather than addressing issues that may be inherently wrong with the healthcare system that predisposes the individual to make errors. Human factors engineering (HFE), which is focused on removing human factors as much as possible from errors, has the potential to greatly impact medical errors in intensive care units. Applied in other high-risk industries, HFE has been critical in understanding and preventing errors at a systems level.

44669,The ArgP protein stimulates the Klebsiella pneumoniae gdhA promoter in a lysine-sensitive manner.,"The lysine-sensitive factor that binds to the upstream region of the Klebsiella pneumoniae gdhA promoter and stimulates gdhA transcription during growth in minimal medium has been proposed to be the K. pneumoniae ArgP protein (M. R. Nandineni, R. S. Laishram, and J. Gowrishankar, J. Bacteriol. 186:6391-6399, 2004). A knockout mutation of the K. pneumoniae argP gene was generated and used to assess the roles of exogenous lysine and argP in the regulation of the gdhA promoter. Disruption of argP reduced the strength and the lysine-dependent regulation of the gdhA promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using crude extracts prepared from wild-type and argP-defective strains indicted the presence of an argP-dependent factor whose ability to bind the gdhA promoter was lysine sensitive. DNase I footprinting studies using purified K. pneumoniae ArgP protein indicated that ArgP bound the region that lies approximately 50 to 100 base pairs upstream of the gdhA transcription start site in a manner that was sensitive to the presence of lysine. Substitutions within the region bound by ArgP affected the binding of ArgP to the gdhA promoter region in vitro and the argP-dependent stimulation of the gdhA promoter in vivo. These observations suggest that elevated intracellular levels of lysine reduce the affinity of ArgP for its binding site at the gdhA promoter, preventing ArgP from binding to and stimulating transcription from the promoter in vivo.","['Bacterial Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Footprinting', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Lysine', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription, Genetic']",18424527,"[['D12.776.097'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['E05.393.300'], ['E05.196.401.500'], ['G05.308.300'], ['B03.440.450.425.425.600', 'B03.660.250.150.400.590'], ['D12.125.068.555', 'D12.125.095.647', 'D12.125.142.497'], ['E05.599.395.397'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This descriptive study surveyed dentists to find out how they would respond to a patient with signs indicating potential CDI.METHODS: A survey on prescribing medications for older patients was mailed to 1,000 dentists in New Jersey. Questions were asked regarding antibiotic selection, probiotic use, and approach to a patient scenario of diarrhea after antibiotic use.RESULTS: Respondents chose amoxicillin most frequently as an antibiotic, and clindamycin if penicillin allergy. When informed their patients had diarrhea, 64.5% advised them to stop the antibiotic. If the patient continued to have diarrhea on follow-up, 75.5% contacted the patient's physician. Most (61.6%) do not prescribe probiotics prophylactically.CONCLUSIONS: Most dentists respond appropriately to antibiotic-associated diarrhea in advising to stop the antibiotic, and seeking physician involvement if no improvement, but there are still many who make recommendations that could delay appropriate care.

In addition, no central pathology laboratory was used.CONCLUSIONS: In stage II rectal cancer cases receiving preoperative radiotherapy vs either postoperative or no radiotherapy, a lower threshold of lymph node retrieval may be sufficient to evaluate prognosis and to guide further therapy.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'California', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Rectal Neoplasms', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",21471752,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E04.446'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.789'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.790', 'C06.301.371.411.307.790', 'C06.405.249.411.307.790', 'C06.405.469.491.307.790', 'C06.405.469.860.180.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['G01.910.857'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
46087,Safety ensuring retinal prosthesis with precise charge balance and low power consumption.,"Ensuring safe operation of stimulators is the most important issue in neural stimulation. Safety, in terms of stimulators' electrical performances, can be related mainly to two factors; the zero-net charge transfer to tissue and the heat generated by power dissipation at tissue. This paper presents a safety ensuring neuro-stimulator for retinal vision prostheses, featuring precise charge balancing capability and low power consumption, using a 0.35 ìm HV (high voltage) CMOS process. Also, the required matching accuracy of the biphasic current pulse for safe stimulation is mathematically derived. Accurate charge balance is achieved by employing a dynamic current mirror at the output of a stimulator. In experiments, using a simple electrode model (a resistor (R) and a capacitor (C) in parallel), the proposed stimulator ensures less than 30 nA DC current flowing into tissue over all stimulation current ranges (32 ìA-1 mA), without shorting. With shorting enabled, further reduction is achieved down to 1.5 nA. Low power consumption was achieved by utilising small bias current, sharing of key biasing blocks, and utilising a short duty cycle for stimulation. Less than 30 ìW was consumed during stand-by mode, mostly by bias circuitry.","['Electric Impedance', 'Electrical Equipment and Supplies', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Safety', 'Microelectrodes', 'Microtechnology', 'Visual Prosthesis']",24681924,"[['G01.358.500.249.277.350'], ['E07.305'], ['E05.320'], ['E05.330'], ['E07.305.250.500'], ['H01.570', 'J01.897.520.500'], ['E07.695.950']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
29793,On-line counting of cysteine residues in peptides during electrospray ionization by electrogenerated tags and their application to protein identification.,"The electrochemically induced mass spectrometric tagging of cysteines by substituted hydroquinones was studied for peptides in a classical electrospray solvent (i.e., MeOH/H2O/AcOH 50/49/1). The tagging efficiency was tested with different hydroquinone compounds on an undecapeptide containing one cysteine residue. 2-carboxymethylhydroquinone was the most reactive probe and revealed to be suitable for cysteine quantification in peptides containing up to three cysteine residues, even in the case of two consecutive cysteines in the sequence. We demonstrate the compatibility of the on-line electrochemical tagging method for the cysteine content analysis of peptides coming from gel-free protein digestion procedures. The identification of bovine serum albumin and human alpha-lactalbumin digest samples in a peptide mapping strategy was greatly improved by the application of the electrotagging technique as post-column treatment. Indeed, the determination of cysteine content in the tryptic peptides provided powerful information in order to enhance the identification score as well as the discrimination against other protein candidates. The tagging method was then applied to the determination of four proteins in a model mixture.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cysteine', 'Humans', 'Lactalbumin', 'Online Systems', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Proteins', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Staining and Labeling']",15624160,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D02.886.030.230', 'D02.886.489.155', 'D12.125.154.299', 'D12.125.166.230'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.034.398', 'D12.776.256.159.750.816.250'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.742'], ['E05.196.181.400.454.720', 'E05.196.401.319.720', 'E05.196.700', 'E05.393.760.705.685'], ['D12.644'], ['D12.776'], ['D12.776.034.841.540', 'D12.776.124.727.875'], ['E05.196.566.600'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670', 'E05.200.500.620.670', 'E05.200.750.600.670']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
47319,Acute and chronic effects of adriamycin on fatty acid oxidation in isolated cardiac myocytes.,"This study was designed to determine if acute (in vitro) or chronic (in vivo) adriamycin inhibits cardiac fatty acid oxidation and if so at what sites in the fatty acid oxidation pathway. In addition, the role of L-carnitine in reversing or preventing this effect was examined. We determined the effects of adriamycin in the presence or absence of L-carnitine on the oxidation of the metabolic substrates [1-14C]palmitate. [1(-14)C] octanoate. [1(-14)C]butyrate, [U-14C]glucose, and [2(-14)C]pyruvate in isolated cardiac myocytes. Acute exposure to adriamycin caused a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT 1) dependent long-chain fatty acid, palmitate, oxidation. Chronic exposure to (18 mg/kg) adriamycin inhibited palmitate oxidation 40% to a similar extent seen in vitro with 0.5 mM adriamycin. Acute or chronic administration of L-carnitine completely abolished the adriamycin-induced inhibition of palmitate oxidation. Interestingly, medium- and short-chain fatty acid oxidation, which are independent of CPT 1, were also inhibited acutely by adriamycin and could be reversed by L-carnitine. In isolated rat heart mitochondria, adriamycin significantly decreased oxidation of the CPT 1 dependent substrate palmitoyl-CoA by 50%. However, the oxidation of a non-CPT 1 dependent substrate palmitoylcarnitine was unaffected by adriamycin except at concentrations greater than 1 mM. These data suggest that after in vitro or in vivo administration, adriamycin, inhibits fatty acid oxidation in part secondary to inhibition of CPT 1 and/or depletion of its substrate, L-carnitine, in cardiac tissue. However, these findings also suggest that L-carnitine plays an additional role in fatty acid oxidation independent of CPT 1 or fatty acid chain length.","['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Caprylates', 'Carnitine', 'Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Glucose', 'Heart', 'Male', 'Mitochondria, Heart', 'Myocardium', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Palmitic Acid', 'Pyruvic Acid', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",9140835,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248.106'], ['D02.241.081.222', 'D10.251.122'], ['D02.092.877.883.099'], ['D08.811.913.050.350.200'], ['A11.251'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['D10.251'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['A07.541'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564.627.603', 'A11.284.835.626.627.603'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D10.251.694.750'], ['D02.241.755.812.800'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
31667,Sustained virological response to interferon plus ribavirin reduces non-liver-related mortality in patients coinfected with HIV and Hepatitis C virus.,"BACKGROUND: Sustained virological response (SVR) after therapy with interferon plus ribavirin reduces liver-related complications and mortality in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). We assessed the effect of SVR on HIV progression and mortality not related to liver disease.METHODS: An observational cohort study including consecutive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with interferon plus ribavirin between 2000 and 2008 in 19 centers in Spain.RESULTS: Of 1599 patients, 626 (39%) had an SVR. After a median follow-up of approximately 5 years, we confirmed that failure to achieve an SVR was associated with an increased risk of liver-related events and liver-related death. We also observed higher rates of the following events in nonresponders than in responders: AIDS-defining conditions (rate per 100 person years, 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI), .59-1.10] vs 0.29 [.10-.48]; P= .003), non-liver-related deaths (0.65 [.42-.87] vs 0.16 [.02-.30]; P = .002), and non-liver-related, non-AIDS-related deaths (0.55 [.34-.75] vs 0.16 [.02-.30]; P = .002). Cox regression analysis showed that the adjusted hazard ratios of new AIDS-defining conditions, non-liver-related deaths, and non-liver-related, non-AIDS-related deaths for nonresponders compared with responders were 1.90 (95% CI, .89-4.10; P = .095), 3.19 (1.21-8.40; P = .019), and 2.85 (1.07-7.60; P = .036), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that eradication of HCV after therapy with interferon plus ribavirin in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is associated not only with a reduction in liver-related events but also with a reduction in HIV progression and mortality not related to liver disease.","['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coinfection', 'Female', 'HIV Infections', 'Hepatitis C', 'Humans', 'Interferons', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Ribavirin', 'Spain', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Viral Load']",22610932,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.122.388'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C01.218'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.440', 'D12.776.467.374.440', 'D23.529.374.440'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['D13.570.800.790'], ['Z01.542.846'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.225.875.950', 'E05.200.875.950', 'G06.920.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
16458,[The outpatient care in the Latium region (Italy) in 2001].,"The Region of Latium has been operating an Outpatient Care Information System (SIAS) since 1997 to monitor the supply of outpatient care in a territory with a population of over five million. The present work has the aim of describing the outpatient care in the region, in terms of number of facilities involved by category (public and private, operating in the regional public health system) and volume of procedures rendered to residents in 2001. Of the 971 outpatient facilities operating in hospitals and elsewhere--37% state managed and 67% private--distributed in a non-uniform manner throughout the region, the majority is concentrated in the city of Rome, which by itself accounts for 49% of its total amount of facilities, and in a lesser measure in the other provincial capitals (Viterbo, Rieti, Frosinone, Latina). In 2001, 71 million procedures were performed, comprising 17 million prescriptions, for an economic value of over 400 million Euros. The three specialties of greatest use were Lab Analysis, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, and Radiology, making up 88% of the total outpatient procedures performed within the precinct of the regional health service, in respective measures of 57%, 27%, and 4%. It is noted that the public facilities are prevalently polyspecialistic while a great number of private facilities are monospecialistic and perform procedures almost exclusively (96%) in the three specialties of greatest use. The other specialties which receive notable use are Cardiology, Eye Care, Orthopedics and Neurology. In general, the greater the number of facilities there are in either the public or private sector, the greater the level of activity in terms of procedures performed, with the exception of the area of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation where the correlation is inversely proportioned; in fact, for this specialty the public facilities, which are represented in a much greater number throughout the region, supply only 7% of the volume of activity.","['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Catchment Area, Health', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Medicine', 'Private Sector', 'Public Sector', 'Rome', 'Specialization', 'Utilization Review']",15554509,"[['N02.278.035'], ['N01.224.791.200', 'N03.349.650.095', 'N06.850.505.400.800.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.542.489'], ['H02.403'], ['I01.791', 'N04.452.633.390'], ['I01.795', 'N04.452.633.890'], ['Z01.433.850', 'Z01.542.489.569'], ['H02.811'], ['N04.761.879', 'N05.700.900']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
37080,Neuroprotective exendin-4 enhances hypothermia therapy in a model of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.,"Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy remains a global health burden. Despite medical advances and treatment with therapeutic hypothermia, over 50% of cooled infants are not protected and still develop lifelong neurodisabilities, including cerebral palsy. Furthermore, hypothermia is not used in preterm cases or low resource settings. Alternatives or adjunct therapies are urgently needed. Exendin-4 is a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus that has also demonstrated neuroprotective properties, and is currently being tested in clinical trials for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized a neuroprotective effect for exendin-4 in neonatal neurodisorders, particularly in the treatment of neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Initially, we confirmed that the glucagon like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) was expressed in the human neonatal brain and in murine neurons at postnatal Day 7 (human equivalent late preterm) and postnatal Day 10 (term). Using a well characterized mouse model of neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effect of exendin-4 in both postnatal Day 7 and 10 mice. An optimal exendin-4 treatment dosing regimen was identified, where four high doses (0.5 µg/g) starting at 0 h, then at 12 h, 24 h and 36 h after postnatal Day 7 hypoxic-ischaemic insult resulted in significant brain neuroprotection. Furthermore, neuroprotection was sustained even when treatment using exendin-4 was delayed by 2 h post hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury. This protective effect was observed in various histopathological markers: tissue infarction, cell death, astrogliosis, microglial and endothelial activation. Blood glucose levels were not altered by high dose exendin-4 administration when compared to controls. Exendin-4 administration did not result in adverse organ histopathology (haematoxylin and eosin) or inflammation (CD68). Despite initial reduced weight gain, animals restored weight gain following end of treatment. Overall high dose exendin-4 administration was well tolerated. To mimic the clinical scenario, postnatal Day 10 mice underwent exendin-4 and therapeutic hypothermia treatment, either alone or in combination, and brain tissue loss was assessed after 1 week. Exendin-4 treatment resulted in significant neuroprotection alone, and enhanced the cerebroprotective effect of therapeutic hypothermia. In summary, the safety and tolerance of high dose exendin-4 administrations, combined with its neuroprotective effect alone or in conjunction with clinically relevant hypothermia make the repurposing of exendin-4 for the treatment of neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy particularly promising.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Exenatide', 'Humans', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain', 'Mice', 'Neuroprotective Agents']",30165597,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['D12.644.187', 'D20.888.300', 'D23.946.833.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.258.750'], ['C10.228.140.300.150.716', 'C10.228.140.624.500', 'C14.907.253.092.716', 'C23.888.852.079.797.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15216,Biochemical characterization of the glutamate transport in Trypanosoma cruzi.,"The role of amino acids in trypanosomatids goes beyond protein synthesis, involving processes such as differentiation, osmoregulation and energy metabolism. The availability of the amino acids involved in those functions depends, among other things, on their transport into the cell. Here we characterize a glutamate transporter from the human protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Kinetic data show a single saturable system with a Km of 0.30 mM and a maximum velocity of 98.34 pmoles min(-1) per 2 x 10(7) cells for epimastigotes and 20 pmoles min(-1) per 2 x 10(7) cells for trypomastigotes. Transport was not affected by parasite nutrient starvation for up to 3h. Aspartate, alanine, glutamine, asparagine, methionine, oxaloacetate and alpha-ketoglutarate competed with the substrate in 10-fold excess concentrations. Glutamate uptake was strongly dependent on pH, but not on Na+ or K+ concentrations in the extracellular medium.

6696,Sonodynamically-induced anticancer effects by functionalized fullerenes.,"BACKGROUND: Functionalized fullerenes, such as polyhydroxy fullerenes (PHF), have attracted particular attention due to their water solubility and their potential application in tumor imaging and therapy as carbon nanomaterials. In this study, the sonodynamically-induced antitumor effect of PHF was investigated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sonodynamically-induced antitumor effects of PHF in combination with ultrasound were investigated using isolated sarcoma 180 cells and solid tumor from colon 26 carcinoma cells.RESULTS: The cell damage induced by sonication was enhanced by two-fold in the presence of 80 ìM PHF. Histidine significantly inhibited this enhancement. This inhibitory effect suggests that the sonodynamically-induced antitumor effect was mediated by sonodynamically-generated reactive oxygen species. The combined treatment of ultrasonic exposure with PHF suppressed the growth of implanted colon 26 tumors. The destruction of tumor tissue was observed with the ultrasonic treatment in combination with PHF, while neither the treatment with PHF alone nor that with ultrasound alone caused necrosis.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PHF is a potential sonosensitizer for sonodynamic treatment of solid tumors.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Fullerenes', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Nitrogen Oxides', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Sarcoma 180', 'Ultrasonic Therapy']",23898072,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['E01.370.225.500.363', 'E05.200.500.363', 'E05.242.363'], ['D27.505.519.217.500'], ['D01.268.150.250', 'J01.637.512.600.612.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.510', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.510'], ['D01.362.635', 'D01.625.550', 'D01.650.550.587'], ['D01.339.431', 'D01.650.775'], ['C04.557.450.795.830.780', 'C04.619.857.656'], ['E02.565.280.945']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
22322,"Purification and thermal stability of several amino acid-specific tRNAs from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB8.","Three species of methionine tRNAs and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and isoleucine tRNAs were purified from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB8. Formylation studies of the three methionine tRNAs and their codon-specific binding activities to ribosomes showed that two of them (named tRNAf1Met and tRNAf2Met) were initiator tRNAs and the other (named tRNAmMet) was a non-initiator. The tRNAs from T. thermophilus all had melting temperatures of up to ten degrees higher than the corresponding species from E. coli. Most of the species also had slightly higher G+C contents than the corresponding species of E. coli, and each of them contained one mol each of the modified nucleosides, O2'-methylguanosine (Gm), 2-thioribothymidine (s2T), and 1-methyladenosine (m1A). Their high melting temperatures could be explained by their high G+C contents and the presence of the modified nucleosides, espically s2T. Comparison of the melting temperatures of T. thermophilus tRNAf2Met with those of E. coli tRNAfMet and tRNAmMet at different magnesium concentrations showed that magnesium was also a factor in the thermostability of the thermophile tRNA.","['Codon', 'Drug Stability', 'Escherichia coli', 'Isoleucine', 'Kinetics', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Phenylalanine', 'RNA, Transfer', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl', 'Ribonucleosides', 'Ribosomes', 'Species Specificity', 'Thermus', 'Tyrosine']",6987208,"[['D13.444.735.544.355', 'G05.360.335.355', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.190'], ['E05.916.330'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D12.125.070.577', 'D12.125.142.383'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.393.640', 'G02.111.603', 'G05.627'], ['D12.125.072.050.685', 'D12.125.142.666'], ['D13.444.735.757'], ['D12.125.780', 'D13.444.735.757.715'], ['D13.570.800'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.811'], ['G16.824'], ['B03.440.400.425.875'], ['D12.125.072.050.875']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27139,"Inhibition by adrenergic neurone blocking agents of the relaxation induced by BRL 38227 in vascular, intestinal and uterine smooth muscle.","1. The adrenergic neurone blocking agents, guanethidine and bretylium, have been tested for inhibitory activity against the actions of some relaxant drugs (BRL 38227, noradrenaline, sodium nitroprusside, theophylline) in vascular, intestinal and uterine smooth muscle. 2. In guinea-pig isolated taenia caeci pre-contracted with KCl (25 mM), BRL 38227 (0.1-10 microM) and noradrenaline (10 nM-100 microM) each caused concentration-dependent relaxation. Guanethidine and bretylium (50 microM) each antagonized the relaxation to BRL 38227 but not that to noradrenaline. At high concentration (500 microM), the adrenergic neurone blocking agents antagonized the action of BRL 38227 and, to some extent, that of noradrenaline. 3. In rat isolated aorta pre-contracted with noradrenaline (300 nM), BRL 38227 (0.0125-3.2 microM) and sodium nitroprusside (0.3-100 nM) each produced concentration-dependent smooth muscle relaxation. Guanethidine and bretylium (5-500 microM) each antagonized the action of BRL 38227 without antagonizing that of sodium nitroprusside. 4. Rats were pretreated with 17-beta oestradiol benzoate. Tension waves were then induced from segments of isolated, oestrogen-dominated uterus by transmural electrical stimulation or by oxytocin (0.2 nM). These tension waves were inhibited by BRL 38227 (0.025-3.2 microM) or theophylline (0.05-0.8 mM) in a concentration-dependent manner. Guanethidine (50 microM) antagonized the action of BRL 38227 in both the electrically- and oxytocin-driven tissues. In the electrically-driven tissues, guanethidine (50 microM) did not antagonize the inhibition to theophylline. 5. In KCl (25 mM)-treated guinea-pig taenia caeci, guanethidine (50 microM) inhibited the efflux of 86Rb+ evoked by BRL 38227 (10 microM) but not that evoked by noradrenaline (10 microM). In contrast, apamin(100 nM) reduced the efflux of 86Rb+ which was promoted by noradrenaline, but did not affect efflux induced by BRL 38227.6. It is concluded that the adrenergic neurone blocking agents, guanethidine and bretylium (each at 50 microM), selectively inhibit the relaxant action of BRL 38227 in vascular, intestinal and uterine smooth muscle. If this inhibition reflects direct blockade of the K+-channel (KKCO) which is opened by BRL 38227, then the adrenergic neurone blocking agents act as inhibitors selective for KKCO as opposed to the small, apamin-sensitive (SKCa) and large (BKca) conductance, Ca2""-dependent K+-channels.","['Animals', 'Aorta, Thoracic', 'Benzopyrans', 'Bretylium Compounds', 'Cromakalim', 'Female', 'Guanethidine', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Intestines', 'Male', 'Muscle Relaxation', 'Muscle, Smooth', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular', 'Nitroprusside', 'Norepinephrine', 'Potassium Chloride', 'Pyrroles', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sympatholytics', 'Theophylline', 'Uterine Contraction']",1422581,"[['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114.056.372'], ['D03.383.663.283', 'D03.633.100.150'], ['D02.092.877.096.333'], ['D03.383.129.578.150', 'D03.383.663.283.455', 'D03.633.100.150.455'], ['D02.078.370.460'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['A03.556.124'], ['G11.427.494.554'], ['A02.633.570', 'A10.690.467'], ['A02.633.570.491', 'A07.015.733.500', 'A10.690.467.491'], ['D01.248.497.158.291.350.550', 'D01.490.100.300.550', 'D01.625.400.100.325.550'], ['D02.033.100.291.502', 'D02.092.063.480', 'D02.092.211.215.746', 'D02.092.311.830', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.830'], ['D01.210.450.150.750', 'D01.745.625'], ['D03.383.129.578'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D27.505.696.663.050.850'], ['D03.132.960.751', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824.751'], ['G08.686.784.769.326.700', 'G11.427.494.890']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

8597,Chemotherapeutics: a questionable or a promising project.,"While repository adjuvants are already established drugs for antigen specific immunomodulation, no unspecific active immunomodulator has successfully passed clinical trials in tumor patients in Western countries yet. As this is in striking contrast to the effects seen with unspecific immunomodulators in experimental immunological and tumor test systems, the value of those screening models to predict clinical success may be asked for. To improve the success rate, it is recommended to test compounds for their immunomodulatory effects as broad as possible in ex vivo and in vivo test systems. Subsequently, the prophylactic as well as therapeutic potency of selected immunomodulating drugs should be evaluated in various models of aptitude, such as chronic infection, autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory reactions. Those diseases are at least to a certain extent influenced by the immune system, in contrast to the uncertainty in case of tumor diseases. In a battery of chronic infection models we could find that different chemoimmunotherapeutics with very similar immunopharmacological activity behaved quite different. Most compounds were ineffective, a part enhanced chronic diseases and only in a few cases a therapeutic effect could be shown. On the other hand, effectivity in protection against the pathogenicity of subsequently applied, selected microorganisms does not predict the therapeutic potency for the same pathogen. Altogether the data show that activation of cells of the immune system by an immunostimulating drug does not predict its therapeutic potency. Moreover, activation of immune cells may also impair the immune resistance.","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infections', 'Leucine', 'Lymphocytes', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental']",3791955,"[['D27.505.696.477.067'], ['B01.050'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['E05.290.750', 'E05.337.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.095.465.425'], ['C01'], ['D12.125.070.637', 'D12.125.142.441'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['G12.287.500'], ['C04.619', 'E05.598.500.496']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8734,Merocyanine 540 as a fluorescent probe of altered membrane phospholipid asymmetry in activated whole blood platelets.,"BACKGROUND: Platelet activation leads to the loss of a natural asymmetry of membrane phospholipids (PL) and the subsequent exposure of negatively charged PL in platelets with procoagulant activity that can be monitored routinely with annexin V (AN-V).METHODS: Flow cytometric analysis of merocyanine 540 (MC540) binding may be the alternate choice for the monitoring of platelet procoagulant activity. Due to the increased partition of negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) in the membrane outer leaflet of activated platelets, the interaction with MC540 is reduced.RESULTS: Collagen, which facilitated platelet PL bilayer symmetrization, vastly reduced MC540 fluorescence and augmented AN-V binding to platelets. Such a collagen-induced symmetrization was further augmented in the presence of thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP, SFLLRNPNDKYEPF). In the presence of VO(4) ((-3)) (the inhibitor of aminophospholipid translocase), the rebuilt of membrane asymmetry was attenuated, which resulted in further reduced MC540 fluorescence and enhanced AN-V binding in activated cells. In platelets incubated with thapsigargin, the inhibitor of platelet tubular system Ca(2+) ATP-ase, which elevates intraplatelet Ca(2+) concentration, TRAP increased AN-V and reduced MC540 binding. The chelating of Ca(2+) with EGTA outside of activated platelets reduced AN-V binding, but did not affect MC540-positive platelets. The fluctuations in reduced staining with MC540 paralleled enhanced AN-V binding (r = -0.481, P < 0.01), especially for strong ""procoagulant"" activating agents.CONCLUSIONS: (1) MC540 may be used in whole blood flow cytometry for the monitoring of platelet membrane symmetrization as an alternate or compounding method to AN-V. (2) Platelet staining with MC540 is sensitive to the fluctuations in the intraplatelet [Ca(2+)] during platelet activation.

32969,A reproductive and developmental screening study of the fungal toxin ochratoxin A in Fischer rats.,"The presence of the mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA) in cereal grains is due to the growth of toxigenic Penicillium mold on stored crops. Human exposure to OTA is higher in infants, toddlers, and children than in adolescents and adults, based on exposure assessments of ng OTA consumed/kg body weight/day. Ochratoxin A is nephrotoxic and teratogenic in animals, but its effects on juveniles exposed during the reproduction and development period have not been studied. To address this, Fischer rats were exposed to 0, 0.16, 0.4, 1.0, or 2.5 mg OTA/kg diet throughout breeding, gestation, and lactation and its adverse effects were assessed in adult rats and their offspring on postnatal day (PND) 21. There were no effects on implantation but post-implantation fetotoxicity was observed in the 2.5 mg/kg dose group, corresponding to a calculated dose of 167.0 ìg/kg bw/day in dams. Adverse effects on body and kidney weights and on clinical parameters indicative of renal toxicity were significant in adult rats exposed to 1.0 mg OTA/kg diet (55.2 and 73.3 ìg/kg bw/day in adult males and females, respectively) and in PND21 rats at the 0.4 mg/kg dose (33.9 ìg/kg bw/day in dams), suggesting that weanling rats were more sensitive to OTA than adults. Overall, nephrotoxicity was the primary effect of OTA in weanling rats exposed throughout gestation and lactation at sub-fetotoxic concentrations in diet.","['Abnormalities, Drug-Induced', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Ochratoxins', 'Poisoning', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Renal Insufficiency', 'Teratogens']",29971579,"[['C16.131.042'], ['E02.319.267.100'], ['B01.050'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['D03.383.663.283.446.800.500', 'D03.633.100.150.446.800.500', 'D23.946.587.697'], ['C25.723'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C13.703'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.200', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.200'], ['C12.777.419.780', 'C13.351.968.419.780'], ['D27.888.569.864']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
32955,Sentinel node mapping guided by indocyanine green fluorescence imaging: a new method for sentinel node navigation surgery in gastrointestinal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, gastrointestinal cancer has also been identified as a target for sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS). This study is the first to determine the feasibility of sentinel node (SN) mapping guided by indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging in gastrointestinal cancer.METHODS: Our series consisted of 22 patients with gastric cancer and 26 patients with colorectal cancer who had undergone standard surgical resection. ICG solution was injected intraoperatively into the subserosa around the tumor. Fluorescence imaging was obtained by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera with a light-emitting diode with a wavelength of 760 nm as the light source and a cut filter to filter out light with wavelengths below 820 nm as the detector.RESULTS: Immediately after the ICG injection, lymphatic vessels draining the tumor and round-shaped SNs were visualized by their bright fluorescence. Even SNs that were not green in color could be easily and clearly visualized by ICG fluorescence imaging. The SN detection rate and mean number of SNs were 90.9% and 3.6 +/- 4.5 (mean +/- SD), respectively, in patients with gastric cancer, and 88.5% and 2.6 +/- 2.4, respectively, in patients with colorectal cancer. Among the patients with gastric cancer, the accuracy and false-negative rates were 88.9 and 33.3%, respectively, in patients with T(1) stage cancer, and 70.0 and 60.0%, respectively, overall, in all the patients. Among the patients with colorectal cancer, the corresponding values were 100 and 0%, respectively, in patients with T(1) stage cancer, and 82.6 and 66.7%, respectively, overall, in all the patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results show that ICG fluorescence imaging allows easy, highly sensitive and real-time imaging-guided SN mapping in patients with gastric or colorectal cancer. SN mapping guided by ICG fluorescence imaging could be a promising tool deserving further clinical exploration.","['Aged', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Coloring Agents', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Lymph Nodes', 'Male', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Stomach Neoplasms']",18379188,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['D27.720.233'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.473.400'], ['A10.549.400', 'A15.382.520.604.412'], ['E05.196.712.726.676', 'E05.196.867.826.676'], ['C04.588.274.476.767', 'C06.301.371.767', 'C06.405.249.767', 'C06.405.748.789']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
49301,The success of opening single chronic total occlusion lesions to improve myocardialviabilitytrial (SOS-COMEDY): Study protocol of a prospective multicenter study.,"AIMS: Success of opening single (SOS)-comedy is a prospective multicenter study to compare the improvement in the decrease of myocardial viability by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with that by optimal medical therapy (OMT) alone in patients with chronic total occlusion (CTO) of a single coronary artery.METHODS AND RESULTS: The risks and the benefits of both options (PCI and OMT) were listed in a CTO decision aid (DA). Eligible participants detected by invasive coronary angiography (ICA) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) were divided into PCI or OMT groups according to patients' choice after shared-decision making process with DA. Participants will undergo positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and proceed to ICA and revascularization if possible. Blinded core laboratory interpretation will be performed for ICA, CCTA, PET/CT, CMR, and TTE. All participants will be followed up for 12 months. The primary endpoint is the improvement to the decrease of myocardial viability from baseline assessed with the use of PET/CT after 12-month follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: All of the patients are appropriately consented before enrolling in this study, which has been approved by the Ethics Committee. Results of SOS-COMEDY will be helpful to develop a strategy for single CTO patients.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anticholesteremic Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Coronary Occlusion', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Diet, Reducing', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Percutaneous Coronary Intervention', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Prospective Studies', 'Smoking Cessation', 'Young Adult']",29668609,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D27.505.519.186.071.202', 'D27.505.954.557.500.202'], ['D27.505.954.411.162'], ['C14.280.647.250.272', 'C14.907.585.250.272'], ['E05.245', 'L01.313.500.750.190'], ['E02.642.249.285', 'G07.203.650.240.285'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.100.814.529.968', 'E04.502.382.968'], ['D27.505.954.502.780'], ['E01.370.350.350.800.700.500', 'E01.370.350.350.810.645', 'E01.370.350.567.500', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810.490', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800.399.500', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810.645', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810.723', 'E01.370.350.710.800.399.500', 'E01.370.350.825.800.399.500', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810.700', 'E01.370.384.730.800.399.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['F01.145.488.732'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

46942,Tumor cell-matrix interaction: pericellular matrix degradation and metastasis.,"In order to determine key MMPs for invasion and metastasis in various human cancers, we examined the expression of ten MMPs (MMP-1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13 and MT1, 2, 3-MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and 2) in breast carcinomas, thyroid papillary carcinomas, endometrial carcinomas, ovarian carcinomas, gastric adenocarcinomas, oral squamous cell carcinomas and gliomas. Of the MMPs examined, the activation of proMMP-2 by MT1-MMP (membrane type 1-MMP) was commonly important for the invasion and metastasis of these cancers except for endometrial carcinomas. The MMP-2 and MT1-MMP were localized to the carcinoma cells and gelatinolytic activity was demonstrated within the carcinoma cell nests by in situ zymography. In endometrial carcinomas, production and activation of proMMP-7 were a key determinant of the lymph node metastasis. The activation of proMMP-2 in gliomas involved MT2-MMP as well as MT1-MMP, and a combination of decreased TIMP-2 production and enhanced MT1-MMP expression was important in the subarachnoidal dissemination of glioblastoma cells. Brevican, a major adult brain proteoglycan, was degraded with MMP-1, 2, 3, 7, 10 and ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase-1) by being cleaved at the MMP site (the Ala360-Phe361 bond) with the MMPs and ADAM site (the Glu395-Ser396 bond) with ADAMTS4. Since activated MMP-2 and ADAMTS4 are present in human glioma tissues, they may play a key role in the invasion of glioma cells through the brevican degradation. The data in the present study suggest that the extracellular matrix-degrading metalloproteinases acting probably on the cell membranes of cancer cells are essential to the invasion and metastasis of human cancers.","['Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",11217446,"[['A11.284.295.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.525', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.525'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['C04.697.650', 'C23.550.727.650'], ['C04'], ['D12.776.645.875.450'], ['D12.776.645.875.500'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25256,"SMILE, a new orphan nuclear receptor SHP-interacting protein, regulates SHP-repressed estrogen receptor transactivation.","SHP (small heterodimer partner) is a well-known NR (nuclear receptor) co-regulator. In the present study, we have identified a new SHP-interacting protein, termed SMILE (SHP-interacting leucine zipper protein), which was previously designated as ZF (Zhangfei) via a yeast two-hybrid system. We have determined that the SMILE gene generates two isoforms [SMILE-L (long isoform of SMILE) and SMILE-S (short isoform of SMILE)]. Mutational analysis has demonstrated that the SMILE isoforms arise from the alternative usage of initiation codons. We have confirmed the in vivo interaction and co-localization of the SMILE isoforms and SHP. Domain-mapping analysis indicates that the entire N-terminus of SHP and the middle region of SMILE-L are involved in this interaction. Interestingly, the SMILE isoforms counteract the SHP repressive effect on the transactivation of ERs (estrogen receptors) in HEK-293T cells (human embryonic kidney cells expressing the large T-antigen of simian virus 40), but enhance the SHP-repressive effect in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-435 cells. Knockdown of SMILE gene expression using siRNA (small interfering RNA) in MCF-7 cells increases ER-mediated transcriptional activity. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SMILE and SHP down-regulates estrogen-induced mRNA expression of the critical cell-cycle regulator E2F1. Collectively, these results indicate that SMILE isoforms regulate the inhibition of ER transactivation by SHP in a cell-type-specific manner and act as a novel transcriptional co-regulator in ER signalling.","['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Mice', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",18657049,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.260.108', 'D12.776.930.127'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D12.644.360.024.328.049', 'D12.776.157.057.158.049', 'D12.776.476.024.420.049', 'D12.776.660.769.049', 'D12.776.930.211.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500.520'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.776.800'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['D12.776.826'], ['D12.776.826.750.350', 'D12.776.930.778.350'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['G05.308.800'], ['E05.393.220.870', 'E05.601.690.650', 'E05.601.870']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2686,Nitrogen requirements in severely injured patients.,"The study was designed to evaluate nitrogen needs in severely injured patients during the first week after trauma. Thirty-nine patients aged from 18 to 65 years with a burn or fractures of more than two long bones were studied. Energy requirements were given parenterally as fat and glucose in isocaloric amounts. The patients were randomized into five groups receiving different amounts of nitrogen from zero to 0.3 g kg body-weight-1 24 h-1. Daily and cumulative nitrogen balance, urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion and nitrogen retention were calculated on days 2-8 after trauma. With no nitrogen, the mean(s.e.m.) daily nitrogen balance after the trauma was -13.8(0.5) gN. The balance improved markedly in groups with a nitrogen intake of up to 0.2 g kg body-weight-1 (P less than 0.001) compared with the no-nitrogen group.

1678,Expanding the Utilization of the Osteocutaneous Radial Forearm Free Flap beyond Mandibular Reconstruction.,"Background The osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap (OCRFFF) for mandibular reconstruction has been well described. Despite this flap's utility in the repair of such defects, the indications for the OCRFFF have continued to expand in recent years. The advantages of the OCRFFF allow for a high degree of versatility in the reconstruction of the various anatomical and aesthetic units of the head and neck. In this review, the authors aim to explore the successful utilization of the OCRFFF beyond the reconstruction of composite mandibular defects. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed. All subjects who underwent OCRFFF reconstruction at a tertiary academic center between January 2004 and December 2014 were identified. A total of six patients undergoing this procedure for indications other than composite mandibular defects of the head and neck were included. Results A total of six patients underwent OCRFFF reconstruction for correction of nonmandibular defects. Flap success was experienced in six of six cases (100%). Indications included midface maxillary reconstruction (N = 2), orbit reconstruction (N = 1), frontal sinus and forehead reconstruction (N = 2), and subglottic stenosis reconstruction (N = 1). There were no immediate perioperative complications. On long-term follow-up, one subject developed a nasocutaneous fistula following radiation and eventually required maxillary hardware removal. Conclusion As a result of its growing role and versatility, the OCRFFF should be incorporated as a multipurpose tool in the armamentarium of reconstructive microvascular surgeons in the repair of composite head and neck defects beyond the mandible.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Female', 'Forearm', 'Free Tissue Flaps', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mandible', 'Mandibular Neoplasms', 'Mandibular Reconstruction', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteotomy', 'Radius', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",26848567,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['A01.378.800.585'], ['A10.850.710.500', 'E07.862.710.500'], ['G12.875.545.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.502.632', 'A14.521.632'], ['C04.588.149.721.450.583', 'C05.116.231.754.450.583', 'C05.500.499.583', 'C05.500.607.442', 'C07.320.515.583', 'C07.320.610.583'], ['E06.645.562.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.555.580'], ['A02.835.232.087.090.700'], ['E04.680'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E04.936.537'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
34299,Can rectal endoscopic sonography be used to predict infiltration depth in patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis of the rectum?,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of rectal endoscopic sonography (RES) in the prediction of the infiltration depth of rectal endometriosis and to ascertain whether RES could be used to choose between segmental bowel resection and a more conservative approach, such as shaving or discoid resection.METHODS: In this retrospective study, 38 consecutive patients with symptomatic deep infiltrating endometriosis of the rectum who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection were included. RES results for infiltration depth of rectal endometriosis were compared with results of pathological examination. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively), positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) and test accuracy were calculated for the presence of infiltration of the muscularis layers and submucosal/mucosal layers, as demonstrated by RES and confirmed by histopathological analysis.RESULTS: For the detection of muscularis layer infiltration by endometriosis, the PPV of RES was 100%, whereas for the detection of submucosal/mucosal layer involvement, the sensitivity was 89%, specificity was 26%, PPV was 55%, NPV was 71%, test accuracy was 58% and positive and negative LRs were 1.21 and 0.40, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: RES is a valuable tool for detecting rectal endometriosis as endometriotic infiltration of the muscularis layer can be predicted accurately. However, RES is less accurate in detecting submucosal/mucosal layer involvement and cannot, therefore, be used to choose between bowel resection and a more conservative approach.","['Adult', 'Endometriosis', 'Endosonography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Rectal Diseases', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",23754206,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C13.351.500.163'], ['E01.370.350.850.280'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.388.250.520', 'E04.502.250.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['C06.405.469.860'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
48849,[A modified protocol for generating the simulated weightlessness rat model].,"OBJECTIVE: To introduce a modified protocol for generating the simulated weightlessness rat model by hindlimb unloading.METHODS: Ninety male adult SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control group, classical suspension group and modified suspension group (n=30/group). In the classical suspension group, a strip of medical adhesive tape was attached to the tail, with horizontal filament tape wrapping. A piece of gauze was wrapped around the tail at the outermost layer and the tail was suspended for hindlimb unloading. In the modified suspension group, a layer of plastic net was added between the horizontal filament tape and the gauze to reduce the squeeze on the tail as a buffer zone and ensure proper circulation of the tail. After 4 weeks of suspension, damage to the tail and sheath detachment were observed. Meanwhile the body weight and right soleus wet weight of rats were measured.RESULTS: The ratio of right soleus wet weight to body weight was decreased significantly in both the classical suspension group and the modified suspension group compared with the control group, while there was no difference in body weight among the three different groups. Importantly, the incidence of tail ischemia and necrosis (13.3% vs 40.0% in the classical suspension group) and the incidence of sheath detachment from tail (3.3% vs 26.7% in the classical suspension group) were significantly lower whereas the success rates of model (33.3% vs 83.3% in classical suspension group) was significantly higher in the modified suspension group.CONCLUSION: The modified protocol decreases the incidence of tail necrosis and sheath detachment in the rat tail suspension and increases the success rate of the hindlimb unloading rat model, with improved simplicity and practicability.","['Animals', 'Hindlimb Suspension', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Weightlessness Simulation']",31250615,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.472.760.370', 'E05.977.400', 'N06.230.150.440.950.400'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['E05.318.370.700', 'E05.581.500.805', 'N05.715.360.325.675', 'N06.850.520.445.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['E05.977', 'N06.230.150.440.950']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Shear stresses were measured and principal stresses were separated into six different models of maxillary central incisor arrangements.RESULTS: The value of maximum stresses and the absolute values of principal stresses and positive stresses were obtained. The distribution curve of shear stresses and principal stresses was also shown.CONCLUSIONS: The horizontal distance between the incisive papilla center and the incisal margin of the maxillary central incisor should be no more than 8 mm, if the anterior mandibular arch is larger than the maxillary arch. The principal stress is a better indicator of stress on edentulous maxillary bone when load is applied at the protrusive occlusal position.","['Alveolar Process', 'Birefringence', 'Dental Models', 'Dental Stress Analysis', 'Denture Design', 'Elasticity', 'Epoxy Resins', 'Humans', 'Incisor', 'Jaw, Edentulous', 'Maxilla']",10557172,"[['A02.835.232.781.324.502.125', 'A14.521.125', 'A14.549.167.646.094'], ['G01.590.080'], ['E06.261', 'J01.897.280.500.545.129.200', 'L01.178.820.090.545.129.200'], ['E06.308'], ['E06.780.346.760.300', 'E06.912.250'], ['G01.374.590'], ['D05.750.716.822.461', 'D25.720.716.822.461', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.461'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A14.549.167.860.425'], ['C05.500.480', 'C07.320.550', 'C07.465.550.425', 'C07.793.597.425'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.502.645', 'A14.521.645']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

35996,Developing and Implementing Major League Baseball's Health and Injury Tracking System.,"In 2010, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association reached an agreement regarding the development and implementation of an electronic medical record system and a new league-wide injury surveillance system. The systems were developed to create a more efficient method to track medical histories of players longitudinally as they move across Major and Minor league affiliates, as well as to identify and monitor injury trends in the sport, identify areas of specific concern, and conduct epidemiologic research to better optimize player health and safety. The resulting injury surveillance system, the Health and Injury Tracking System (HITS), is a robust system that includes all players from the both the Major and Minor Leagues. HITS also allows for data linkage with other player- and game-level data to inform the development of injury prevention policies and programs. In the present article, we document the development and implementation of HITS; describe its utility for epidemiologic research; illustrate the potential analytic strength of the surveillance system and its ability to inform policy change; and note the potential for this new surveillance system to advance the field of sports injury epidemiology.","['Baseball', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Occupational Injuries', 'Risk Management', 'Sentinel Surveillance', 'United States']",26874305,"[['I03.450.642.845.110'], ['E05.318.372.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C26.716'], ['N03.219.463.800', 'N04.452.871'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700.650', 'E05.318.650', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625.650', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700.650', 'N06.850.520.699', 'N06.850.780.675.650'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
47526,"Dual sexual and drug-related predictors of hepatitis C incidence among sex workers in a Canadian setting: gaps and opportunities for scale-up of hepatitis C virus prevention, treatment, and care.","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally. While sex workers may face elevated HCV risks through both drug and sexual pathways, incidence data among sex workers are severely lacking. HCV incidence and predictors of HCV seroconversion among women sex workers in Vancouver, BC were characterized in this study.METHODS: Questionnaire and serological data were drawn from a community-based cohort of women sex workers (2010-2014). Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression were used to model HCV incidence and predictors of time to HCV seroconversion.RESULTS: Among 759 sex workers, HCV prevalence was 42.7%. Among 292 baseline-seronegative sex workers, HCV incidence density was 3.84/100 person-years (PY), with higher rates among women using injection drugs (23.30/100 PY) and non-injection crack (6.27/100 PY), and those living with HIV (13.27/100 PY) or acute sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (5.10/100 PY). In Cox analyses adjusted for injection drug use, age (hazard ratio (HR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86-1.01), acute STI (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.02-6.06), and non-injection crack use (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.18-6.25) predicted time to HCV seroconversion.DISCUSSION: While HCV incidence was highest among women who inject drugs, STIs and the use of non-injection stimulants appear to be pathways to HCV infection, suggesting potential dual sexual/drug transmission. Integrated HCV services within sexual health and HIV/STI programs are recommended.","['Adult', 'Canada', 'Directive Counseling', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Workers', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Substance Abuse, Intravenous', 'Transgender Persons']",28027990,"[['M01.060.116'], ['Z01.107.567.176'], ['F02.784.176.279', 'F04.408.413.349', 'N02.421.461.363.349'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['M01.776'], ['F01.145.802'], ['C01.221.812', 'C01.778', 'C12.294.668', 'C13.351.500.711', 'C23.550.291.531.937'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['C25.775.793', 'F03.900.793'], ['M01.777.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
39062,Transcription of a silkworm tRNA(cAla) gene is directed by two AT-rich upstream sequence elements.,"A region within 35 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site of a variety of silkworm Class III templates is absolutely required for transcription in vitro. To determine whether the activity of this region can be attributed to a particular sequence element, we systematically replaced 4-5 bp segments of the region upstream of a silkworm tRNA(cAla) gene. We show that replacement of either of two AT-rich blocks markedly impairs promoter function, whereas replacement of other sequences has little or no effect. Additional mutants were constructed to test whether base composition or sequence is important for function of the AT blocks. We find that some sequences are more effective than others, but that various AT-rich sequences can direct transcription at a high level. Possible mechanisms by which such elements could act are discussed.","['Animals', 'Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Bombyx', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Transfer, Ala', 'Transcription, Genetic']",8290347,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.080'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.937.650.100'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D13.444.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D13.444.735.757.700.050'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

12467,Valproate oral loading in the treatment of acute mania.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from earlier studies suggests that the antimanic activity of valproate becomes most pronounced within 1 to 4 days of achieving serum concentrations of 50 mg/L or greater. We conducted a prospective study to assess the onset of antimanic activity of oral loading dosages of valproate administered to achieve serum concentrations above 50 mg/L within 24 hours.METHOD: Nineteen patients with bipolar disorder, manic phase, received divalproex sodium 20 mg/kg/day in divided dosages for 5 days, without other psychotropic agents except lorazepam up to 4 mg/day. Serum valproate concentrations were measured after 1 and 4 days of treatment. Improvement was measured daily by a blind rater using the Young Mania Rating Scale (MRS).RESULTS: Serum valproate concentrations greater than 50 mg/L were reached in all 15 patients completing the study. Ten (53%) of the 19 patients who received at least one complete loading dose displayed a significant (greater than 50%) reduction in MRS scores by study termination. These responders displayed the greatest percent change in MRS scores over the first 3 days of treatment. Side effects were minimal.CONCLUSION: Valproate can be safely administered by oral loading and may produce rapid onset of antimanic response in some patients.","['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Lorazepam', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Valproic Acid']",8253698,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['E02.319.267.100'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F03.084.500'], ['E02.319.310'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.070.450'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['D02.241.081.944.509.900', 'D10.251.400.895.593.900']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

The first mode is distinguished by measured control signal leaps used for the identification of a system state and for a further movement correction and precise definition of active muscle composition. The second mode is characterized by the estimation of movement direction only, in case when a certain value of a regulated parameter is maintained or reached.

A review of the literature has revealed 2 major themes: (1) research that argues that massage has a direct relationship with positive health outcomes and (2) research that stresses that although there are little or no measurable physiological changes that occur from massage, patients' perceptions of stress and anxiety were significantly reduced. The simple act of touch-focused care, even a simple 5-min hand or foot massage, can be useful in lowering a patient's perceived level of stress. Further research is necessary on the benefits and risks of implementing massage therapy in the hospital setting.","['Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Education, Nursing, Continuing', 'Humans', 'Massage', 'Stress, Psychological']",20664464,"[['N03.219.151.125'], ['I02.358.212.450', 'I02.358.462.399'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.190.599.750.750', 'E02.779.867.880.750', 'E02.831.535.867.880.750'], ['F01.145.126.990', 'F02.830.900']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

30554,Arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis is independent of stress-responsive signaling pathways but sensitive to inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase in HepG2 cells.,"Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) has been found to be remarkably effective in the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although evidences for the proapoptotic activity of As(2)O(3) have been suggested in leukemic and other solid cancer cells, the nature of intracellular mechanisms is far from clear. In the present study, we investigated As(2)O(3) affect on the stress-responsive signaling pathways and pretreatment with antioxidants using HepG2 cells. When treated with micromolar concentrations of As(2)O(3), HepG2 cells became highly apoptotic paralleled with activation of caspase-3 and members of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) but not p38 MAP kinase. However, inhibition of each kinase activity failed to inhibit apoptosis by As(2)O(3). Addition of n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) effectively protected cells from apoptosis and significantly lowered As(2)O(3)-induced activation of caspase-3. However, neither NAC nor DPI was able to effect ERK or JNK activation induced by As(2)O(3). Guanidinoethyldisulfide dihydrochloride (GED) and 2-ethyl-2-thiopseudourea (ETU), known inhibitors of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), also suppressed the apoptotic activity of As(2)O(3). These results suggest that As2O3 induces caspase-mediated apoptosis involving a mechanism generating oxidative stress. However, activation of some stress-responsive signaling pathways by As(2)O(3) may not be the major determinant in the course of apoptotic processes.","['Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides', 'Signal Transduction']",12754411,"[['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D01.075.038', 'D01.650.550.125'], ['D01.075', 'D02.129'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772.500', 'D12.776.157.687.575', 'D12.776.660.720.575'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D01.248.497.158.685', 'D01.650.550'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Comparison of genomes between L. monocytogenes strains F2365 and H7858 identified a sequence encoding a portion of the PRT/PTS system IIA 2 protein domain as appropriate for mu-TGGE analysis. Thirty-one strains belonging to 10 different serovar types were tested by PCR, and sequence analysis of the amplified products revealed that the strains comprise 11 groups. All 55 possible pairs within the 11 groups were examined by mu-TGGE analysis. Of these, 47 pairs could be successfully discriminated, with a total electrophoresis time of only 7 min. Moreover, Cy3/Cy5 labeling allowed rapid identification of the sequence type in unknown strains of L. monocytogenes isolated from meat.

27350,Consumer evaluation of a mental health liaison nurse service in the Emergency Department.,"The mainstreaming of mental health services into the general healthcare system has added to the demands placed on Emergency Departments (EDs) in terms of the assessment, management and disposition of mental health related presentations. There is a growing body of research that highlights the difficulties encountered by consumers presenting to the ED with mental health concerns (Summers and Happell 2003). This paper describes a study undertaken to evaluate the Mental Health Liaison Nurse (MHLN) role in the ED of an inner city teaching hospital in Sydney Australia.

6941,Binding free energy and counterion release for adsorption of the antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin B on a POPG membrane.,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study the interaction of an anionic palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) bilayer with the cationic antimicrobial peptide bovine lactoferricin (LFCinB) in a 100 mM NaCl solution at 310 K. The interaction of LFCinB with a POPG bilayer is employed as a model system for studying the details of membrane adsorption selectivity of cationic antimicrobial peptides. Seventy eight 4 ns MD production run trajectories of the equilibrated system, with six restrained orientations of LFCinB at 13 different separations from the POPG membrane, are generated to determine the free energy profile for the peptide as a function of the distance between LFCinB and the membrane surface. To calculate the profile for this relatively large system, a variant of constrained MD and thermodynamic integration is used. A simplified method for relating the free energy profile to the LFCinB-POPG membrane binding constant is employed to predict a free energy of adsorption of -5.4+/-1.3 kcal/mol and a corresponding maximum adsorption binding force of about 58 pN. We analyze the results using Poisson-Boltzmann theory. We find the peptide-membrane attraction to be dominated by the entropy increase due to the release of counterions and polarized water from the region between the charged membrane and peptide, as the two approach each other. We contrast these results with those found earlier for adsorption of LFCinB on the mammalianlike palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine membrane.","['Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane', 'Computer Simulation', 'Lactoferrin', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Phosphatidylglycerols', 'Thermodynamics', 'Water']",19905150,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.644.050', 'D12.776.543.695.054'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A11.284.149'], ['L01.224.160'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.471', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.471', 'D12.776.157.427.750.249', 'D12.776.256.159.750.816.500.507', 'D12.776.377.457.507', 'D12.776.395.507', 'D12.776.556.579.750.249'], ['D10.570.510', 'J01.637.087.500.510'], ['G02.111.570.820'], ['E05.599.595.500', 'G02.111.570.895', 'L01.224.160.500'], ['D10.570.755.375.760.400.885'], ['G01.906'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
20350,"The viral erbA oncogene protein, a constitutive repressor in animal cells, is a hormone-regulated activator in yeast.","The v-erbA oncogene is a retrovirus-transduced and altered copy of a cellular gene for a thyroid hormone receptor. In animal cells, the v-erbA protein fails to respond to hormone and acts as a dominant negative allele, inhibiting gene activation normally conferred by the wild-type thyroid hormone receptor. We report here that, unexpectedly, the v-erbA protein acts as a hormone-regulated transcriptional activator in S. cerevisiae. We suggest that the ability of v-erbA protein to function as a transcriptional repressor or an activator is determined by interaction with, or modification by, other cellular factors, and that this phenomenon may be relevant to understanding ligand regulation of the normal thyroid and steroid hormone receptors.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbA', 'Oncogenes', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'beta-Galactosidase']",1979758,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['A11.251.210'], ['C04.697.098.500', 'C23.550.727.098.500'], ['C23.550.210.050.500.500', 'G05.365.590.029.530.175', 'G05.365.590.175.050.500.500', 'G05.365.590.762.180', 'G05.558.800.180', 'G05.700.131.500.500'], ['E05.393.220'], ['G05.308.330'], ['G05.360.337'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['D13.444.600.601', 'D27.505.259.750.600.650', 'D27.720.470.530.600.650'], ['D12.776.624.664.520.750.882', 'D12.776.964.700.750.882', 'D12.776.964.775.750.882'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500'], ['G05.360.600'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D12.776.624.664.700.830', 'D12.776.826.850'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['D12.776.260.703', 'D12.776.930.780'], ['D12.776.624.664.520.750', 'D12.776.964.700.750', 'D12.776.964.775.750'], ['B01.300.107.795.785.800', 'B01.300.930.705.655'], ['D12.776.930'], ['G05.308.800'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['D08.811.277.450.410.100']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
3239,"Reduction of subcutaneous mass, but not lean mass, in normal fetuses in Denver, Colorado.","OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that reduced birth weight in normal fetuses born at moderately high altitude (Denver), compared with the birth weight in normal fetuses born at sea level (Milan), is caused by a reduction in both lean mass and subcutaneous fat mass.STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-four normal singleton pregnancies (46 in Denver, 48 in Milan) had serial ultrasonographic axial images obtained to assess subcutaneous tissues of fetuses as a measure of body fat. The abdominal wall thickness and mid upper arm and mid thigh were examined. The equation was: Subcutaneous tissue equals total cross-sectional area minus bone and muscle area. Lean mass included the area of muscle and bone, head circumference, and femur length.RESULTS: Gestational age at delivery was similar between groups. Birth weight was less at Denver's altitude (2991 +/- 79 g versus 3247 +/- 96 g; P =.04). Abdominal wall thickness, mid upper arm, and mid thigh subcutaneous tissues measurements were significantly reduced at Denver's altitude and increased further in significance with advancing gestational age. Lean mass measurements were similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: The reduced birth weight of the newborns in Denver was the result of a reduction in fetal subcutaneous fat tissue and not lean mass. Ultrasonography can be used to follow subcutaneous measurements longitudinally and to detect differences, and potentially disease processes, in study populations.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Adult', 'Altitude', 'Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'Colorado', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Pregnancy', 'Probability', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Ultrasonography, Prenatal']",11641662,"[['A10.165.114'], ['M01.060.116'], ['G16.500.275.058', 'N06.230.058'], ['G02.111.130', 'G03.180', 'G07.100.049'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['Z01.107.567.875.760.210'], ['C13.703.277.370', 'C16.300.390', 'C23.550.393.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.542.489'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E05.978.810'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E01.370.350.850.865', 'E01.370.378.630.865']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
40388,Quality of Life in Painful Peripheral Neuropathies: A Systematic Review.,"Objective: Neuropathic pain is a common presenting complaint of patients with peripheral neuropathy (PN) and is considered one of the most disabling neuropathic symptoms, with detrimental effects on patients' quality of life (QoL). The aim of this review was to overview the current literature that focuses on QoL in painful PN of various aetiologies. We sought to clarify the direct effect of pain and its treatment on patients' QoL.Methodology: A systematic computer-based literature search was conducted using the PubMed database to search for papers on QoL in painful PN. Information was extracted regarding prevalence, demographics, and response to treatment where relevant.Results: We identified 66 articles eligible for inclusion. The vast majority of studies (n=47) focused on patients with diabetic PN. Other aetiologies of painful PN where QoL has been studied to date include gluten, immune-mediated, HIV, chemotherapy-induced, and chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy. Pharmacological treatment is the mainstay in managing pain and has a direct positive and independent effect on the overall QoL. Other nonpharmacological approaches can also be of benefit, either alone or as adjuvant treatments, and are discussed.Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that QoL is impaired in painful PN and should not be neglected in clinical practice. Patients' pain management and subsequent impact on QoL should routinely be assessed and monitored.","['Humans', 'Neuralgia', 'Pain Management', 'Quality of Life']",31249636,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.668.829.600', 'C23.888.592.612.664'], ['E02.745', 'N04.590.607.500'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

2892,Bevacizumab treatment for acute branch retinal vein occlusion accompanied by subretinal hemorrhage.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in the treatment of acute (<3 months [mo]. duration) macular edema (ME), with or without subretinal hemorrhage (SRH), resulting from branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 33 consecutive patients (n = 33 eyes) with ME caused by acute BRVO. All patients received an injection of IVB at baseline examination. All patients were followed monthly, with administration of additional IVB injections if there was persistent or recurrent ME. Specific patterns of ME were investigated using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).RESULTS: SD-OCT revealed serous retinal detachments in the fovea of 15 eyes, 10 of which had accompanying foveal SRH. Based on initial detection of foveal SRH, patients were divided into SRH-negative (n = 23 eyes) or SRH-positive (n = 10 eyes) groups. Initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) did not differ between the two groups. In the SRH-negative group, both BCVA and central macular thickness (CMT) improved significantly after IVB injections (mean, 2.3 injections) at the 6-mo. follow-up examination. In the SRH-positive group, there was no significant improvement in BCVA after IVB injections (mean, 2.0 injections), although there was a significant decrease in CMT. The final BCVA of the SRH-positive group was significantly poorer than that of the SRH-negative group (p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: The presence of foveal SRH may be a negative predictor of IVB treatment outcomes for BRVO patients with ME.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Bevacizumab', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intravitreal Injections', 'Macular Edema', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Retinal Vein Occlusion', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tomography, Optical Coherence', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Visual Acuity']",25330134,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.696.377.077.099', 'D27.505.696.377.450.100', 'D27.505.954.248.025'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.060.375', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.060.438', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.200.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.530.475.500'], ['C11.768.585.439.245'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C11.290.807', 'C11.768.710', 'C23.550.414.756.775'], ['C11.768.760', 'C14.907.355.830.925.650', 'C14.907.760'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E01.370.350.589.249.500', 'E01.370.350.825.805.500', 'E05.642.249.500'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200'], ['E01.370.380.850.950', 'F02.463.593.932.901', 'G14.940']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
43472,"Associations of dietary patterns with bone mass, muscle strength and balance in a cohort of Australian middle-aged women.","Influences of dietary patterns on musculoskeletal health are poorly understood in middle-aged women. This cross-sectional analysis from a cohort of 347 women (aged 36-57 years) aimed to examine associations between dietary patterns and musculoskeletal health outcomes in middle-aged women. Diet was measured by the Cancer Council of Victoria FFQ. Total body bone mineral content (TB BMC), femoral neck and lumbar spine bone density (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), lower limbs muscle strength (LMS) and balance tests (timed up and go test, step test, functional reach test (FRT) and lateral reach test) were also measured. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify dietary patterns and scores for each pattern generated using factor loadings with absolute values ?0·20. Associations between food pattern scores and musculoskeletal outcomes were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Three dietary patterns were identified: 'Healthy' (high consumption of a plant-based diet - vegetables, legumes, fruit, tomatoes, nuts, snacks, garlic, whole grains and low intake of high-fat dairy products), 'high protein, high fat' (red meats, poultry, processed meats, potatoes, cruciferous and dark-yellow vegetables, fish, chips, spirits and high-fat dairy products) and 'Processed foods' (high intakes of meat pies, hamburgers, beer, sweets, fruit juice, processed meats, snacks, spirits, pizza and low intake of cruciferous vegetables). After adjustment for confounders, Healthy pattern was positively associated with LMS, whereas Processed foods pattern was inversely associated with TB BMC and FRT. The associations were not significant after accounting for multiple comparisons. There were no associations with any other outcomes. These results suggest that maintaining a healthy diet could contribute to bone acquisition, muscle strength and balance in adult life. However, while they provide some support for further investigating dietary strategies for prevention of age-related loss of muscle and deterioration in balance, the exploratory nature of the analyses means that confirmation in longitudinal studies and/or trials with pre-specified hypotheses is needed.","['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adult', 'Australia', 'Body Mass Index', 'Bone Density', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dairy Products', 'Diet', 'Fabaceae', 'Female', 'Femur Neck', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Micronutrients', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Strength', 'Postural Balance', 'Red Meat', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vegetables']",28990541,"[['E01.370.350.700.024', 'E05.196.712.224.187'], ['M01.060.116'], ['Z01.639.100', 'Z01.678.100.373'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['G11.427.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['G07.203.300.350', 'J02.500.350'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.401'], ['A02.835.232.043.150.510'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['D27.505.696.494', 'G07.203.300.681.500', 'J02.500.681.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.600.425', 'G11.427.560'], ['F02.830.816.541.752', 'G07.888.750.500', 'G11.427.690', 'G11.561.790.541.595'], ['G07.203.300.600.813', 'J02.500.600.813'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['B01.650.160.956', 'B01.650.510.956', 'G07.203.300.850', 'J02.500.850']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
15514,Exploring physiotherapists' experiences of implementing a cognitive behavioural approach for managing low back pain and identifying barriers to long-term implementation.,"OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were two-fold: (i) to describe physiotherapists' experiences of implementing a cognitive behavioural approach (CBA) for managing low back pain (LBP) after completing an extensive online training course (iBeST), and (ii) to identify how iBeST could be enhanced to support long-term implementation before scale up for widespread use.DESIGN: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 physiotherapists from six National Health Service departments in the Midlands, Oxfordshire and Derbyshire. Questions centred on (i) using iBeST to support implementation, (ii) what barriers they encountered to implementation and (iii) what of information or resources they required to support sustained implementation. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed using NVivo. Themes were categorised using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Evidence-based techniques were identified using the behaviour change technique taxonomy to target relevant TDF domains.RESULTS: Three themes emerged from interviews: anxieties about using a CBA, experiences of implementing a CBA, and sustainability for future implementation of a CBA. Themes crossed multiple TDF domains and indicated concerns with knowledge, beliefs about capabilities and consequences, social and professional roles, social influences, emotion, and environmental context and resources. We identified evidence-based strategies that may support sustainable implementation of a CBA for LBP in a physiotherapy setting.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted potential challenges for physiotherapists in the provision of evidence-based LBP care within the current UK NHS. Using the TDF provided the foundation to develop a tailored, evidence-based, implementation intervention to support long term use of a CBA by physiotherapists managing LBP within UK NHS outpatient departments.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Education, Continuing', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Low Back Pain', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Physical Therapists', 'Physical Therapy Modalities', 'Professional Role', 'United Kingdom']",28826744,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['F01.100.050', 'N05.300.100'], ['I02.358.212'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.420', 'L01.399.250.520', 'N05.715.360.300.400', 'N06.850.520.308.420'], ['C23.888.592.612.107.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['M01.526.485.790', 'N02.360.790'], ['E02.779', 'E02.831.535'], ['F01.829.316.616.625'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
15155,Lymphotoxin beta receptor (Lt betaR): dual roles in demyelination and remyelination and successful therapeutic intervention using Lt betaR-Ig protein.,"Inflammation mediated by macrophages is increasingly found to play a central role in diseases and disorders that affect a myriad of organs, prominent among these are diseases of the CNS. The neurotoxicant-induced, cuprizone model of demyelination is ideally suited for the analysis of inflammatory events. Demyelination on exposure to cuprizone is accompanied by predictable microglial activation and astrogliosis, and, after cuprizone withdrawal, this activation reproducibly diminishes during remyelination. This study demonstrates enhanced expression of lymphotoxin beta receptor (Lt betaR) during the demyelination phase of this model, and Lt betaR is found in areas enriched with microglial and astroglial cells. Deletion of the Lt betaR gene (Lt betaR-/-) resulted in a significant delay in demyelination but also a slight delay in remyelination. Inhibition of Lt betaR signaling by an Lt betaR-Ig fusion decoy protein successfully delayed demyelination in wild-type mice. Unexpectedly, this Lt betaR-Ig decoy protein dramatically accelerated the rate of remyelination, even after the maximal pathological disease state had been reached. This strongly indicates the beneficial role of Lt betaR-Ig in the delay of demyelination and the acceleration of remyelination. The discrepancy between remyelination rates in these systems could be attributed to developmental abnormalities in the immune systems of Lt betaR-/- mice. These findings bode well for the use of an inhibitory Lt betaR-Ig as a candidate biological therapy in demyelinating disorders, because it is beneficial during both demyelination and remyelination.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Brain', 'Cell Division', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Cuprizone', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Lymphotoxin beta Receptor', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microglia', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 14']",17626203,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['A08.186.211'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.800.750'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.367.190'], ['C10.314'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.760.245'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['A08.637.400', 'A11.650.400'], ['A08.637.600.500', 'A08.637.800.500', 'A08.675.542.512.560', 'A08.800.800.690.500', 'A10.755.503', 'A11.284.149.165.600', 'A11.650.600.500', 'A11.650.800.500', 'A11.671.501.512.560', 'A11.671.514.553'], ['A08.637.600', 'A11.650.600'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D12.644.276.374.750.690', 'D12.776.467.374.750.690', 'D23.529.374.750.690']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
19259,Parasympathetic blockade promotes recovery from atrial electrical remodeling induced by short-term rapid atrial pacing.,"The purpose of the present study was to assess the influence of autonomic blockade on shortening of effective refractory period (ERP) induced by short-term rapid atrial pacing (RAP) and its recovery process. Fifteen patients (8 men, 7 women, age 52 +/- 16 years) without structural heart disease and without a history of atrial fibrillation were included in this study. All patients underwent RAP at a cycle length of 300 ms for 5 minutes, after which the ERP was measured in all patients at 1, 3, 5, 7.5, and 10 minutes following cessation of RAP. In ten patients, these RAP and measurements of ERPs were repeated after administration of propranolol (P) and subsequent administration of atropine (P + A), respectively. In the remaining five patients atropine (A) was given first and then the administration of propranolol followed (P + A). Relative to the baseline value, the ERP immediately after RAP did not differ significantly from the Control(C), P, A, or P + A (C, 79%+/- 8%; P, 82%+/- 9%; A, 80%+/- 6%; P + A, 82%+/- 13%). However, the ERP 3 minutes after cessation of RAP was significantly (P < 0.05) longer in A (93%+/- 4%) and P + A (97%+/- 5%) than that in C (86%+/- 5%) and P (86%+/- 5%). The recovery time for ERP to return to pre-RAP value was significantly shorter during A and P + A than during either C or P (C, 536 +/- 161 s; P, 503 +/- 172 s; A, 282 +/- 111 s; P + A, 291 +/- 147 s; P < 0.05). Parasympathetic blockade may promote recovery from ERP shortening induced by short-term RAP.","['Atropine', 'Cardiac Pacing, Artificial', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parasympathetic Nervous System', 'Propranolol', 'Refractory Period, Electrophysiological']",14720152,"[['D02.145.074.722.229.199', 'D03.132.760.180.572.199', 'D03.132.889.180.648.199', 'D03.605.084.500.722.229.199', 'D03.605.869.229.199'], ['E02.331.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A08.800.050.600'], ['D02.033.100.624.698.711', 'D02.033.755.624.698.711', 'D02.092.063.624.698.711', 'D02.455.426.559.847.638.945', 'D04.615.638.945'], ['G07.265.753.770', 'G07.265.760', 'G11.561.601.770', 'G11.561.785']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
28253,Magnetic resonance imaging in a family with hereditary cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Because of a family history of neurologic problems and the documentation of three vascular lesions in one patient, we evaluated 18 members representing three family generations with magnetic resonance imaging. Of these, eight were normal, two had abnormalities probably not related to arteriovenous malformation, one scan was suboptimal, and the remaining eight had evidence of hemorrhagic lesions characteristic of arteriovenous malformation. Four of these patients had multiple lesions, and three patients with lesions had no neurologic symptoms. The findings suggest an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance in this unique case of familial cerebral arteriovenous malformation.","['Adult', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2610730,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C10.228.140.300.535.200', 'C14.907.253.573.200', 'C23.550.414.913.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.228.140.300.520', 'C10.500.190.500', 'C14.240.850.750.295', 'C14.240.850.875.500', 'C14.907.150.295', 'C14.907.253.560.400', 'C16.131.240.850.750.295', 'C16.131.240.850.875.500', 'C16.131.666.190.500'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['E05.393.673'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
10816,Rickettsiales Occurrence and Co-occurrence in Ixodes ricinus Ticks in Natural and Urban Areas.,"Bacteria of Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae families include disease agents spread by Ixodes ricinus ticks, the most common tick vector in Europe. The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence and co-infection prevalence of particular tick-transmitted Rickettsiales members: Rickettsia spp. (further referred as Rs), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap), and ""Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis"" (CNM) in I. ricinus ticks in two types of areas, different in terms of human impact: natural and urban. Using additional data, we aimed at investigating co-occurrence of these Rickettsiales with Borreliella spp. A total of 4189 tick specimens, 2363 from the urban area (Warsaw park and forests) and 1826 from the natural area (forests and park in the vicinity of National Parks), were tested for the presence of Rickettsiales DNA by PCRs. The prevalence of selected Rickettsiales was twice higher in urban than natural areas (13.2% vs. 6.9%, respectively). In total ticks, the prevalence of Rs, Ap, and CNM was 6.5%, 5.3%, and 3.6% in urban areas vs. 4.4%, 1.1%, and 2.1% in natural areas, respectively. Co-infections of Rickettsiales were also more prevalent in urban areas (2.6% vs. 0.3%, respectively). The most common Rs was R. helvetica; also R. monacensis and novel ""Candidatus Rickettsia mendelii"" were detected. Positive association between Ap and CNM infections was discovered. Rickettsiales bacteria occurrence was not associated with Borreliella occurrence, but co-infections with these two groups were more common in ticks in urban areas. In conclusion, three groups of Rickettsiales constituted the important part of the tick pathogen community in Poland, especially in the urbanized central Poland (Mazovia). In the Warsaw agglomeration, there is a greater risk of encountering the I. ricinus tick infected with Rickettsiales and co-infected with Lyme spirochaetes, in comparison to natural areas. This finding raises the question whether cities might in fact be the hot spots for TBDs.","['Animals', 'Borrelia', 'Forests', 'Ixodes', 'Parks, Recreational', 'Poland', 'Rickettsiales']",30327827,"[['B01.050'], ['B03.440.425.410.711.193', 'B03.851.595.193'], ['G16.500.275.157.437', 'N06.230.124.343'], ['B01.050.500.131.166.132.832.400.425'], ['J03.925.680'], ['Z01.542.248.679'], ['B03.440.664', 'B03.660.050.783']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
10702,Assembly of a nanoreactor system with confined magnetite core and shell for enhanced Fenton-like catalysis.,"Conventional solid catalysts for heterogeneous Fenton-like reactions in bulk solution usually suffer from aggregation and vulnerability, which greatly lower the catalytic efficiency and hamper their practical application. Herein, we demonstrate a promising yolk-shell nanostructure with both the core and the shell composed of magnetite (designated as yolk-like Fe3O4@Fe3O4/C) as a nanoreactor capable of accommodating the Fenton-like reaction into its void space. Benefiting from the mesoporous shell and perfect interior cavity of this composite, reactants can access and be abundantly confined within the microenvironment where Fe3O4 sites are dispersed on the entire cavity surfaces, thus leading to a higher catalytic efficiency compared with the conventional solid catalysts in bulk solution. The chosen model reaction of chlorophenols degradation in the presence of the as-prepared materials as well as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) confirms this assumption. Under the optimal reaction conditions, more than 97 % 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) can be degraded in the Fe3O4@Fe3O4/C nanoreactor, whereas only 28 % can be achieved by using bare Fe3O4 particles within 60 min. Furthermore, owing to the existence of the outermost carbon layer and high-magnetization properties, the nanoreactor can be re-used for several runs. The synthesized nanoreactor displays superior catalytic activity toward the Fenton-like reaction compared with the bare solid catalysts, and thereby holds significant potential for practical application in environmental remediation.","['Catalysis', 'Chlorophenols', 'Ferric Compounds', 'Ferrosoferric Oxide', 'Nanostructures']",24737528,"[['G02.130'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.261.190', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.190'], ['D01.490.100'], ['D01.490.100.375', 'D01.490.200.350', 'D01.578.285'], ['J01.637.512']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
34924,Sports game play: a comparison of moderate to vigorous physical activities in adolescents.,"BACKGROUND: Research suggests participation in sports is an important contributor to overall adolescent physical activity (PA). Sports play has become increasingly important in physical education (PE) classes as a means for promoting healthful and enjoyable PA. Research is needed that investigates physiological and perceptual responses to sport play.METHODS: We studied 101 (55 males; 46 females, age 11-14) students who participated in flag football (FF), basketball (BB), and flag rugby (FR). Activity counts were collected using accelerometers. Perceived competence and enjoyment were measured using the intrinsic motivation inventory.RESULTS: Each sport activity produced acceptable levels of activity and positive perceptual responses, but differences among sports were noted. Accelerometry data indicated that FR and BB were more intense than FF (p < .001). Perceptual data indicated participation in FR elicited higher perceptions of competence and greater enjoyment when compared to FF and BB (p < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Participation in sport activity within middle school PE classes provides excellent opportunities for energy expenditure and positive perceptual responses. Most importantly, FR provides an activity stimulus that has potential benefits both physiologically and psychologically.","['Accelerometry', 'Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Self-Assessment', 'Sports', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",24138353,"[['E05.003'], ['M01.060.057'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['M01.060.406'], ['G03.295'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['N04.761.337', 'N05.715.360.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I02.233.543'], ['F01.752.747.792.537'], ['I03.450.642.845'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['G01.910.857'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
15398,Effects of Therapy in Patients Suffering from Chronic Back Pain Treated with Spinal Cord Stimulation.,"Pain in the lumbosacral part of the spine in the course of degenerative disease is the most common cause of physical activity limitation in adults. Treatment includes pharmacotherapy, physiotherapy, psychotherapy, health promotion, and sometimes surgery. Surgical treatment is not always successful, and the various clinical and psychosomatic symptoms that result from surgical treatment failure are known as failed back surgery syndrome. For some patients with this condition, spinal cord stimulation can provide relief. The aim of the work was to define subjective and objective spinal cord stimulation effects by assessing chosen disability and physical activity limitation ratios. Pain intensity, level of disability, and presence of neurological symptoms were assessed. The examination was performed twice: before the stimulator implantation and at least 6 months postimplantation. The study was conducted at the Department of Neurosurgery and Paediatric Neurosurgery in Lublin. Thirty-six patients suffering from failed back surgery syndrome were recruited for this study. The Visual Analog Scale, modified Laitinen's pain questionnaire, and Oswestry Disability Index were used in this work. The study showed that spinal cord stimulation was effective in treating spinal and lower limb pain in 64% of patients, similar to results obtained in other departments. Although back pain and neuropathic pain radiating to the lower limbs decreased, moderate physical activity impairment was still observed according to the Oswestry Disability Index scale. The decrease in neuropathic pain radiating to the lower limbs had the most significant influence on reducing physical activity impairment.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chronic Pain', 'Cohort Studies', 'Failed Back Surgery Syndrome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Low Back Pain', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuralgia', 'Pain Measurement', 'Spinal Cord Stimulation', 'Treatment Outcome']",26187548,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C23.888.592.612.274'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C23.550.767.225', 'C23.888.592.612.107.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.592.612.107.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C10.668.829.600', 'C23.888.592.612.664'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['E02.331.699', 'E02.779.468.699', 'E02.831.535.468.699'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
46163,The aberrancy of immunophenotype and immunoglobulin status as indicators of prognosis in B cell diffuse large cell lymphoma.,"To assess the prognostic significance of the immunophenotype in diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), 105 DLCL patients were studied between 1978 and 1987 using a panel of 40 monoclonal antibodies applied to frozen tissue. Eighty-three patients were found to have B cell phenotypes, and 20 patients had T cell phenotypes. Focusing on markers relevant to clinical outcome among B cell LCL showed that lack of expression of the pan B antigens Leu14 and Leu16 were correlated with decreased survival (Leu14, P = 0.01; Leu16, P = 0.06; log-rank). HLA-DR activity also showed that lack of expression of this antigen correlated with poor survival (P = 0.004, log-rank). Kappa light chain immunoglobulin lack of expression showed predictive value for decreased survival as well (P = 0.005, log-rank). Multivariate analyses of known clinically important variables and the immune phenotypes confirm that the loss of HLA-DR and B cell aberrancy are independent factors predicting a poor clinical outcome. Losing some B activation/kappa antigens appears to be a broad biologic phenomenon linking surface antigen lack of expression with decreased survival. This suggests that aberrancy of immunophenotype and immunoglobulin status are key predictors of survival in B-LCL.","['Antigens, Surface', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains', 'Lymphoma', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Statistics as Topic', 'T-Lymphocytes']",3140668,"[['D23.050.301'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['D12.776.395.550.509.400.440', 'D12.776.543.550.440.400.440', 'D23.050.301.500.400.400.440', 'D23.050.301.500.450.400.440', 'D23.050.705.552.410.400.440', 'D23.050.705.552.450.400.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.350', 'E05.478.583.400', 'E05.601.470.350'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.705.750', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.750', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.750'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.705.750.530', 'D12.776.124.790.651.705.750.530', 'D12.776.377.715.548.705.750.530'], ['C04.557.386', 'C15.604.515.569', 'C20.683.515.761'], ['E01.789.625'], ['G05.695'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.740', 'H01.548.832', 'N05.715.360.750', 'N06.850.520.830'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
45453,"Growth, viability, adhesion potential, and fibronectin expression in fibroblasts cultured on zirconia or feldspatic ceramics in vitro.","Zirconia, a biomaterial widely used in dentistry, has recently attracted much attention for its mechanical strength and toughness. Previously, its lack of mutagenic and carcinogenic power was reported. We describe here other essential aspects to be taken into account to define in vitro the biocompatibility of a material: the growth rate, viability, and adhesion capacity of normal stabilized cells growing on it. To this aim, immortalized RAT-1 fibroblasts, growing either on zirconia and on feldspatic (FE) ceramics were compared. In particular, the level of expression and the intra- and extra-cellular organization of fibronectin, a glycoprotein involved in cellular adhesion and migration during tissue repair, was analyzed. Fibroblasts cultured on zirconia showed a higher growth rate, and underwent necrosis at lower levels than cells on FE ceramic, whereas either materials did not stimulate apoptosis. Adhesion capacity of fibroblasts was evaluated measuring adherent cell nucleic acids with the fluorimetric CyQuant assay, and it was found significantly higher in cells cultured on zirconia than on FE ceramic. This finding may be explained by the higher and more precocious expression of the adhesion protein fibronectin observed by indirect immunofluorescence in fibroblasts on zirconia. Overall, the results suggest that zirconia, exerting low cytotoxicity and strongly inducing adhesion capacity, increases cellular growth rate of fibroblasts. All these features suggest that zirconia could represent a more suitable biomaterial than FE ceramic for prosthesis in dentistry.","['Aluminum Silicates', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ceramics', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibronectins', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Polystyrenes', 'Potassium Compounds', 'Rats', 'Zirconium']",18067158,"[['D01.056.050.075', 'D01.578.725.025', 'D01.650.550.050.075', 'D01.837.725.700.760.050'], ['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['G04.022'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['J01.637.153'], ['A11.329.228'], ['D12.776.377.715.390', 'D12.776.395.550.350', 'D12.776.543.550.350', 'D12.776.860.300.450'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512.240', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512.240', 'E05.200.500.607.512.240', 'E05.200.750.551.512.240', 'E05.478.583.375'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.150.750.800.830', 'D05.750.716.579', 'D25.720.716.579', 'J01.637.051.720.716.579'], ['D01.745'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D01.268.556.950', 'D01.268.956.937', 'D01.552.544.950']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
13699,Multiple functionalization of fluorescent nanoparticles for specific biolabeling and drug delivery of dopamine.,"The development of fluorescent biolabels for specific targeting and controlled drug release is of paramount importance in biological applications due to their potential in the generation of novel tools for simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in several neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the controlled delivery of its agonists already proved to have beneficial effects both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report the synthesis and multiple functionalization of highly fluorescent CdSe/CdS quantum rods for specific biolabeling and controlled drug release. After being transferred into aqueous media, the nanocrystals were made highly biocompatible through PEG conjugation and covered by a carbohydrate shell, which allowed specific GLUT-1 recognition. Controlled attachment of dopamine through an ester bond also allowed hydrolysis by esterases, yielding a smart nanotool for specific biolabeling and controlled drug release.","['Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity', 'Cadmium', 'Cadmium Compounds', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Quantum Dots', 'Selenium', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Sulfides']",22037807,"[['F03.625.094.150'], ['D01.268.556.137', 'D01.268.956.061', 'D01.552.544.137'], ['D01.142'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['D27.505.519.625.150', 'D27.505.696.577.150'], ['E02.319.300'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['D12.776.157.530.500.500.500', 'D12.776.157.530.937.563.500', 'D12.776.543.585.500.500.500', 'D12.776.543.585.937.625.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.228.140.079.862.500', 'C10.228.662.600.400', 'C10.574.928.750'], ['D02.033.455.250.700', 'D05.750.741', 'D25.720.741', 'J01.637.051.720.741'], ['E07.705', 'J01.637.512.600.650'], ['D01.268.185.850', 'D01.578.700'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670', 'E05.200.500.620.670', 'E05.200.750.600.670'], ['D01.248.497.158.874', 'D01.875.350.850', 'D02.886.520']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
25711,Intermediate syndrome of platelet dysfunction.,"We studied eight patients with intermittent bleeding episodes usually following trauma and associated with the ingestion of medicine known to interfere with platelet function. All patients had a normal or minimally prolonged baseline bleeding time. All had a normal platelet count, glass bead retention test, and platelet serotonin content and a variable pattern of abnormalities in prothrombin consumption and platelet factor 3 availability. However, all showed abnormal platelet aggregation reactions using epinephrine, adenosine diphosphate, and collagen. Following the administration of 975 mg aspirin, our patients' bleeding times became prolonged to a greater extent than the bleeding times of normal controls (range 13 to greater than 20 min). Review of the literature showed approximately 5% of ""normal"" controls had findings similar to those we report. We believe we are describing a group of individuals with an intermediate form of platelet dysfunction. Although their bleeding diathesis is not as severe as that of patients with platelet dysfunction syndromes previoulsy described, they do bleed significantly when subjected to trauma following the ingestion of drugs such as aspirin. We propose that this defect is common and should be screened for. The aspirin tolerance test is a simple test for detecting these patients.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aspirin', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Blood Platelet Disorders', 'Blood Platelets', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Factor 3', 'Serotonin', 'Syndrome']",656620,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595.176'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107', 'E01.370.225.625.107', 'E05.200.500.195.107', 'E05.200.625.107', 'E05.242.195.107', 'G04.140.107', 'G09.188.105'], ['E01.370.225.625.115', 'E05.200.625.115'], ['C15.378.140'], ['A11.118.188', 'A15.145.229.188'], ['M01.060.406'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G09.188.370.687', 'G09.188.390.600.640'], ['D12.776.124.125.691', 'D23.119.932'], ['D02.092.211.215.801.852', 'D03.633.100.473.914.814', 'D23.469.050.650'], ['C23.550.288.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
28734,Plasma levels of surfactant protein D and KL-6 for evaluation of lung injury in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients.,"BACKGROUND: Preventing ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) has become pivotal in mechanical ventilation of patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the present study we investigated whether plasma levels of lung-specific biological markers can be used to evaluate lung injury in patients with ALI/ARDS and patients without lung injury at onset of mechanical ventilation.METHODS: Plasma levels of surfactant protein D (SP-D), Clara Cell protein (CC16), KL-6 and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) were measured in plasma samples obtained from 36 patients - 16 patients who were intubated and mechanically ventilated because of ALI/ARDS and 20 patients without lung injury at the onset of mechanical ventilation and during conduct of the study. Patients were ventilated with either a lung-protective strategy using lower tidal volumes or a potentially injurious strategy using conventional tidal volumes. Levels of biological markers were measured retrospectively at baseline and after 2 days of mechanical ventilation.RESULTS: Plasma levels of CC16 and KL-6 were higher in ALI/ARDS patients at baseline as compared to patients without lung injury. SP-D and sRAGE levels were not significantly different between these patients. In ALI/ARDS patients, SP-D and KL-6 levels increased over time, which was attenuated by lung-protective mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (P = 0.02 for both biological markers). In these patients, with either ventilation strategy no changes over time were observed for plasma levels of CC16 and sRAGE. In patients without lung injury, no changes of plasma levels of any of the measured biological markers were observed.CONCLUSION: Plasma levels of SP-D and KL-6 rise with potentially injurious ventilator settings, and thus may serve as biological markers of VALI in patients with ALI/ARDS.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Critical Illness', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucin-1', 'Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D', 'Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tidal Volume', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uteroglobin']",20158912,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D23.101'], ['C23.550.291.625'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D12.776.395.550.560', 'D12.776.395.560.631.115', 'D12.776.543.550.530', 'D23.050.285.050.300', 'D23.050.550.325.300', 'D23.101.140.075.300'], ['D12.776.503.280.249.625', 'D12.776.823.249'], ['D12.776.543.750.615'], ['D12.776.543.750.705'], ['E02.041.625', 'E02.365.647.729', 'E02.880.820'], ['C08.381.840', 'C08.618.840'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.370.386.700.485.750.900.350.750', 'G09.772.850.970.500.700'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D12.776.861.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
8605,Cerebral white matter changes in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia: alterations of the blood-brain barrier.,"The cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia, which is a frequent late manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, is unknown but radiological and pathological studies have implicated alterations in subcortical white matter. To investigate the pathological basis of these white matter abnormalities, we performed an immunocytochemical and histological analysis of subcortical white matter from AIDS patients with and without dementia, from pre-AIDS patients (asymptomatic HIV-seropositive patients), and from HIV-seronegative control subjects. Reduced intensity of Luxol fast blue staining, designated ""diffuse myelin pallor,"" was detected in 8 of 15 AIDS dementia patients, 3 of 13 AIDS nondemented patients, and none of the pre-AIDS patients (n = 2) or control subjects (n = 9). In contrast to Luxol fast blue staining, sections stained immunocytochemically for myelin proteins did not show decreased staining intensities in regions of diffuse myelin pallor. In addition, neither demyelinated axons nor active demyelination were detected in light and electron micrographs of subcortical white matter from brains of patients with AIDS dementia. An increase in the number of perivascular macrophages and hypertrophy of astrocytes and microglia occurred in brain sections from HIV-infected patients. These changes were not specific to dementia or regions of diffuse myelin pallor and they occurred in both gray and white matter. In contrast to the lack of myelin pathology in AIDS dementia brains, significant accumulations of serum proteins in white matter glia were detected in the brains of 12 of 12 patients with AIDS dementia and 6 of 12 AIDS patients without dementia. Serum protein-immunopositive cortical neurons were detected in the frontal cortex of 11 of 12 patients with AIDS dementia and 3 of 12 nondemented AIDS patients. Seronegative control subjects showed minimal serum protein immunoreactivity in both cortex and white matter. We conclude therefore that alterations in the blood-brain barrier and not demyelination contribute to the development of AIDS dementia.","['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Autopsy', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Brain', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelin Basic Protein']",7689819,"[['C01.221.250.875.049', 'C01.221.812.640.400.070', 'C01.778.640.400.070', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.049', 'C01.925.813.400.070', 'C10.228.140.380.070', 'C20.673.480.070', 'F03.615.400.050'], ['C01.221.250.875.040', 'C01.221.812.640.400.040', 'C01.778.640.400.040', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.040', 'C01.925.813.400.040', 'C01.925.839.040', 'C20.673.480.040'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.060', 'E05.070', 'I01.198.780.937.120'], ['A07.035', 'A08.186.211.035'], ['A08.186.211'], ['D05.750.078.593.400', 'D12.776.220.475.400'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['C01.221.250.875.500', 'C01.221.812.640.400.500', 'C01.778.640.400.500', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.500', 'C01.925.813.400.500', 'C20.673.480.500'], ['D12.776.395.550.509.400.440', 'D12.776.543.550.440.400.440', 'D23.050.301.500.400.400.440', 'D23.050.301.500.450.400.440', 'D23.050.705.552.410.400.440', 'D23.050.705.552.450.400.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D12.776.543.620.540', 'D12.776.631.580.510']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
1294,Activation of fibrinolysis in the pericardial cavity during cardiopulmonary bypass.,"The clotting and fibrinolytic systems are activated by tissue factor and by tissue-type plasminogen activator in the pericardial cavity, where the thrombogenicity is greater than that of the surface of modern extracorporeal circuits. This local activation may have consequences for the systemic activation processes during cardiopulmonary bypass. To test this hypothesis, we investigated blood activation by interrupting the blood suction from the pericardial cavity during cardiopulmonary bypass in clinical coronary artery bypass operations. In blood collected in the pericardial cavity, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (p < 0.01), tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen (p < 0.05), fibrinogen degradation products (p < 0.01), and fibrin degradation products (p < 0.01) were significantly higher than in the systemic blood. Plasma heparin was significantly consumed in the pericardial cavity (p < 0.01). Once the pericardial blood was returned to the systemic circulation after resumed suction during cardiopulmonary bypass, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (p < 0.05), fibrinogen degradation products (p < 0.05), and fibrin degradation product (p < 0.05) concentrations increased significantly in the systemic blood. The effects of pericardial tissue on activation of clotting and fibrinolysis were also studied in vitro. When human plasma was incubated for 5 minutes with rabbit pericardium at reduced heparin concentrations, we found significant generation of thrombin (p < 0.05) and plasmin (p < 0.05). If the thrombin inhibitor hirudin was added, plasmin generation was also inhibited (p < 0.05). The results of the clinical and experimental study are in agreement with our hypothesis that tissue factor and tissue-type plasminogen activator accelerate the activation of clotting and sequentially of fibrinolysis under conditions of low heparin concentrations in the pericardial cavity and that this local activation contributes highly to the systemic activation, affecting hemostasis during cardiopulmonary bypass. Topical use of heparin in the pericardial cavity therefore seems indicated to reduce blood activation during cardiopulmonary bypass.","['Blood Coagulation Factors', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Heparin', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Pericardium', 'Platelet Activation']",8231204,"[['D12.776.124.125', 'D23.119'], ['E04.292.413'], ['G09.188.390.150.390'], ['D09.698.373.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A07.541.795', 'A10.615.789.470'], ['G09.188.390.600']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
25368,Magnetic resonance imaging features of canine gliomatosis cerebri.,"A retrospective, case series study was undertaken to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of gliomatosis cerebri in dogs. Fourteen dogs were included by review of histopathological records and contemporaneous MRI. On MRI, all lesions presented as ill-defined, intraaxial lesions within the left and right forebrain hemispheres with involvement of white and gray matter. Lesions presented as hyperintense areas on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences and as hypointense or isointense areas on T1-weighted images, with mild parenchymal contrast enhancement in three dogs. Signal changes were noted in three to 10 cerebral lobes. Other most commonly affected structures were the thalamus (13), caudate nucleus (13), interthalamic adhesion (11), hypothalamus (11), callosal commissure (10), hippocampus (9), and quadrigeminal plate (8). Abnormalities within the caudal fossa were noted in 10 dogs. Solid tumor portions were identified in five dogs. The histopathological examination demonstrated in all dogs a widespread diffuse infiltration with neoplastic glial cells in white and gray matter with meningeal infiltration. Comparison between MRI and histopathology showed that all areas with signal changes on MRI corresponded to diffuse and dense infiltration with neoplastic cells. The signal intensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images reflected the density of neoplastic cells. In all dogs, MRI underestimated lesion extent and meningeal infiltration. Involvement of the caudal fossa was not seen on MRI in three dogs. Despite this, MRI allowed identification of lesions extending into at least three cerebral lobes and therefore satisfying the criteria used for diagnosis of diffuse glioma with gliomatosis cerebri growth pattern in humans.","['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Neuroepithelial', 'Retrospective Studies']",29110365,"[['B01.050'], ['C04.588.614.250.195', 'C10.228.140.211', 'C10.551.240.250'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['C04.557.465.625.600', 'C04.557.470.670', 'C04.557.580.625.600'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
41089,A novel model of HPV infection in meshed human foreskin grafts.,"The present study describes a novel meshing procedure that provided successful low-risk papillomavirus propagation and reproducible wart induction in human foreskin xenografts. The initial HPV6 and/or 11 inocula were collected from clinically excised human wart tissues and confirmed to be free of HPV16, 18 and 31 by PCR analysis. Human foreskin grafts were collected from a circumcision clinic, and pre-inoculated with HPV virions by scarification. Meshing was carried out with a Zimmer Skin Grafter Mesher. Grafts were cut to appropriate size (1cm x 1cm or 5mm x 5mm) for cutaneous or subcutaneous grafting to NIH-nu-bg-xid mice under halothane anesthesia. Cutaneous xenografts were dressed with antibiotics and protective band-aids for 3 weeks. In the paralleled experiment using the same viral stock containing both HPV6 and 11, and matched grafts, no visible papillomas were observed in non-meshed cutaneous xenografts (n = 4 up to 6 months). In comparison, six of eight cutaneous xenografts treated with the meshing procedure formed visible papillomas within 4 months. This high frequency of distinct papilloma induction over the surface of meshed xenografts were reproduced in subsequent experiments with viral stocks containing both HPV11 and 6 (8 out of 10 grafts), or with a single-type HPV11 inoculum (80-100%). In contrast, an initial viral stock of single-type HPV6 provided lower frequency and more delayed papilloma induction. Serial passage of HPV6 in the meshed xenograft appeared to improve both the induction frequency and growth rate up to the 3rd generation. Histology, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed similarity of xenograft warts to those observed in the clinic. The highly reproducible papilloma induction rate and successful viral stock propagation associated with the meshing procedure provide a novel feature in the HPV xenograft model.","['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Animal', 'Papilloma', 'Papillomaviridae', 'Papillomavirus Infections', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",15550271,"[['B01.050'], ['C04.697.098.500.160', 'C23.550.727.098.500.160', 'G06.920.143'], ['A11.329.228'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['E05.598'], ['C04.557.470.700.600'], ['B04.280.210.655', 'B04.613.204.655'], ['C01.925.256.650', 'C01.925.928.725'], ['E02.095.147.725.700', 'E04.680.275.850', 'E04.936.580.700'], ['E04.936.764']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
19551,Effect of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation treatment on cardiac function.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) treatment on cardiac functions using tissue Doppler imaging (TDI).STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-one patients aged 22-35 years were enrolled to COH cycles. Each subject underwent a conventional transthoracic echocardiographic examination that included an assessment of cardiac function. Measurements were taken twice--the first on the second day of the cycle and the second on the day when human chorionic gonadotropin was administered. Twenty-one healthy women were chosen for the control group.RESULTS: The COH treatment did not cause favorable cardiac function changes. The parameters showing the left ventricular diastolic function such as early diastolic peak flow velocity (E), late diastolic peak flow velocity (A), mitral E/A ratios, mitral E wave, deceleration time (DT), lateral isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), and left ventricular myocardial performance index (LVMPI) were not changed. The COH treatment did not affect the right ventricular diastolic functions such as tricuspid valve E wave, DT, right ventricular (RV) IVRT, or right ventricular myocardial performance index (RVMPI). Concurrently, the COH treatment showed no effects on the right and left ventricular systolic functions.CONCLUSION: TDI findings reveal no effects of the COH treatment on cardiac function.","['Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone, Human', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Heart Rate', 'Hormone Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Ovulation Induction', 'Stroke Volume', 'Ventricular Function, Left', 'Ventricular Function, Right', 'Young Adult']",21291037,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['D06.472.699.631.525.343.288.625'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.320', 'D12.644.400.400.740.320', 'D12.644.456.460', 'D12.644.548.365.740.320', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.320'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['D06.347', 'D27.505.696.399.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.875.800.984', 'E05.820.800.984'], ['E01.370.370.380.150.700', 'G09.330.380.124.882'], ['G09.330.955.800'], ['G09.330.955.900'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
3750,Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) Genome: Divergence with the Barred Owl (Strix varia) and Characterization of Light-Associated Genes.,"We report here the assembly of a northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) genome. We generated Illumina paired-end sequence data at 90? coverage using nine libraries with insert lengths ranging from ?250 to 9,600 nt and read lengths from 100 to 375 nt. The genome assembly is comprised of 8,108 scaffolds totaling 1.26 ? 109 nt in length with an N50 length of 3.98 ? 106 nt. We calculated the genome-wide fixation index (FST) of S. o. caurina with the closely related barred owl (Strix varia) as 0.819. We examined 19 genes that encode proteins with light-dependent functions in our genome assembly as well as in that of the barn owl (Tyto alba). We present genomic evidence for loss of three of these in S. o. caurina and four in T. alba. We suggest that most light-associated gene functions have been maintained in owls and their loss has not proceeded to the same extent as in other dim-light-adapted vertebrates.","['Animals', 'Birds', 'Genome', 'Genome, Mitochondrial', 'Light', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Strigiformes', 'Vision, Ocular']",28992302,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.248'], ['G05.360.340'], ['G05.360.340.360'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['E05.393.760.479', 'L01.453.245.667.580'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.815.550'], ['F02.830.816.964', 'G02.111.820.480.900', 'G04.835.480.900', 'G11.561.790.964', 'G14.935']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
35796,Effect of silicone elastomer contact lens wear on endothelial cell morphology in aphakic eyes.,"We prospectively evaluated the effect of extended silicone elastomer contact lens wear on the endothelial mosaic of aphakic subjects. Endothelial cell photography and central corneal thickness measurements were performed on 23 eyes of 15 aphakic subjects (mean age 60 +/- 10 years). These measurements were made before lens wear (n = 23) and were repeated after 1 year (n = 19) and again after 5 years (n = 10) of lens wear. No statistically significant change in mean endothelial cell size or coefficient of variation of cell size was found. Central corneal thickness was significantly decreased at 1 year and hexagonality was significantly increased at 5 years. Thus, the changes in endothelial morphology usually associated with contact lens wear did not occur with silicone lenses, which are highly permeable to oxygen.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aphakia', 'Contact Lenses, Extended-Wear', 'Endothelium, Corneal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen', 'Photography', 'Prospective Studies', 'Silicone Elastomers']",2297994,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C11.510.103'], ['E07.632.500.276.360.220'], ['A09.371.060.067.318', 'A09.371.060.217.318', 'A10.272.491.318'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['E01.370.350.600', 'E05.712'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D05.750.900.850.900', 'D25.720.327.900', 'D25.720.900.850.900', 'J01.637.051.720.327.900', 'J01.637.051.720.900.850.900', 'J01.637.412.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

The combination of both has an important application in the cloud storage. In this paper, we construct a searchable attribute-based encryption scheme with attribute revocation in cloud storage, the keyword search in our scheme is attribute based with access control, when the search succeeds, the cloud server returns the corresponding cipher text to user and the user can decrypt the cipher text definitely. Besides, our scheme supports multiple keywords search, which makes the scheme more practical.

16182,Development of revised Ionising Radiations Regulations.,"New standards in ICRP60 led to the revision of the 1980 European Basic Safety Standards Directive, which in turn has created the necessity to revise the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1985. Proposals from the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) for revised regulations are currently out for public consultation in a formal Consultative Document. This article describes some of the background to the proposals in the Consultative Document, key influences on the revision process and the methods used to develop the proposal so that they are broadly acceptable to stakeholders. Some of the changes proposed are structural in nature, such as integration of the provision of the Outside Workers Regulations. Others are of a legal nature and include: new proposals for justification, prior authorisation and risk assessment; two options for the dose limitation system; and significant changes to the means of recognising the competence of the Radiation Protection Adviser. Following the current public consultation, final proposals need to be drawn up, approved by HSC and cleared through the European Commission under procedures required by the Euratom Treaty. If all goes according to plan, the revised regulations should be on the Statute Book about the middle of next year, with most provisions coming into force on 1 January 2000.","['Europe', 'Humans', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Occupational Diseases', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Radiation Protection']",9656193,"[['Z01.542'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N06.850.460.350.210', 'N06.850.460.350.600.615'], ['C24'], ['N06.850.460.350.600'], ['N06.850.810.425']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
21372,Heterodimer formation of cJun and ATF-2 is responsible for induction of c-jun by the 243 amino acid adenovirus E1A protein.,"The adenovirus E1A proteins differentially regulate AP-1-responsive genes. Collagenase and stromelysin are repressed by E1A, whereas the expression of c-jun is elevated. Inhibition of collagenase has been found to be exerted through the consensus AP-1 binding site TGAGTCA. Here we show that the distal AP-1 binding site in the c-jun promoter, the jun2TRE (TTACCTCA), is the decisive element of this promoter in mediating the positive response to the 243 amino acid E1A product. In vitro binding studies revealed that, in contrast to the consensus AP-1 site which is preferentially targeted by dimers composed of the Jun and Fos families, the jun2TRE binds heterodimers composed of cJun and ATF-2(-like) proteins. Since stimulation of c-jun transcription is a function of the transforming domain of E1A encoded by conserved region 1, cJun--ATF-2 may be one of the effector factors involved in transformation. The data further suggest that E1A can distinguish between cJun--cJun and cJun--ATF-2 in imposing opposite states of activity.","['3T3 Cells', 'Activating Transcription Factors', 'Adenovirus E1A Proteins', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Proteins', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Genes, jun', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",8382609,"[['A11.251.210.100', 'A11.329.228.100'], ['D12.776.260.108.061', 'D12.776.930.127.061'], ['D12.776.460.050.100', 'D12.776.624.664.520.045.050.100', 'D12.776.930.100', 'D12.776.964.700.045.050.100', 'D23.050.285.062.045', 'D23.050.327.062.045'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['D12.776.124'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500.791.365'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D13.695.578.424'], ['D12.776.260.108.820', 'D12.776.624.664.700.182', 'D12.776.660.763', 'D12.776.930.127.820'], ['D12.776.930'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
21520,pH dependent high transfection efficiency of mouse neuroblastomas using TransFectin.,"Mouse neuroblastoma cell lines are often used in lieu of mouse primary neurons in ex vivo experiments, as they provide an easier platform for transfection, compared to the latter. A well-known inherent problem with this strategy is the relatively low transfection efficiency (15-30%) of mouse neuroblastoma cell lines such as neuro-2A and N1E-115. We were able to improve the transfection efficiency of these cell lines by using the cationic lipid reagent, TransFectin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) to optimise the transfection conditions. Our results, based on fluorescence intensity determinations and Western blotting for enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) over-expression in neuro-2A, demonstrated that pH is a crucial factor in determining the transfection efficiency. Under pH-optimised transfection conditions, flow cytometric analysis revealed high EGFP transfection efficiencies of 76.4 +/- 0.5 and 60.9 +/- 0.6% for neuro-2A and N1E-115, respectively. Notably, the optimised TransFectin-based transfection system did not result in any detectable cytotoxicity to the mouse neuroblastomas. The resultant optimised system is economical, easy to use and does not require any specialised equipment.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cations', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",16814394,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['D01.248.497.300'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['D12.776.532.265'], ['G02.300'], ['D25.479.517', 'D26.255.260.517', 'J01.637.051.479.517', 'J01.637.087.500.517'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.590.650.550', 'C04.557.470.670.590.650.550', 'C04.557.580.625.600.590.650.550'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
1538,Effect of the Escherichia coli EMO strain on experimental infection by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in gnotobiotic mice.,"An experimental infection with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium was evaluated in gnotobiotic mice previously exposed to a plasmid-free non-pathogenic Escherichia coli (EMO strain). Mice were exposed to EMO (experimental) or not (control) 10 days before challenge with Salmonella Typhimurium (10(2) colony forming units (CFU)/mouse). Survival after challenge was higher (P < 0.05) in the experimental group (16%) than in the control animals (0%). Histopathological examination of the colon and ileum mucosa of the experimental group showed less extensive lesions such as edema, cell inflammatory infiltration and hyperemia. The epithelial cells of the mucosal surface and the production of the mucous layer were also better preserved in the experimental group. The population levels of Salmonella Typhimurium in the feces were initially 10-fold lower (P < 0.05) in the experimental groups. However, 3 days after challenge both experimental and control groups showed similar population levels ranging from 10(8) to 10(9) CFU/g of feces. The intestinal contents of total and anti-Salmonella Typhimurium sIgA were higher in the experimental groups 10 days after inoculation of E. coli EMO strain. Translocation of Salmonella Typhimurium to the spleen was 10-fold lower (P < 0.05) in the experimental group only on day 3 after infection. This was not related to an increase in the bacterial blood clearance of the animals, as shown by experimental venous challenge with E. coli B41. In conclusion, treatment of mice with E. coli EMO strain promoted a relative protection against experimental infection with Salmonella Typhimurium. This protection was not due to the reduction of the population of pathogens in the intestine but was probably related to stimulation of the immune response.","['Animals', 'Colon', 'Escherichia coli', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Germ-Free Life', 'Humans', 'Ileum', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Probiotics', 'Salmonella Infections, Animal', 'Salmonella typhimurium']",15264007,"[['B01.050'], ['A03.556.124.526.356', 'A03.556.249.249.356'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['A12.459'], ['G06.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.556.124.684.249', 'A03.556.249.124'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['G07.203.300.456.500', 'J02.500.456.500'], ['C01.150.252.400.310.821.706', 'C22.812'], ['B03.440.450.425.800.200.825', 'B03.660.250.150.710.160.760']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The individual magnetometers are configured with a small volume with intense optical pumping, surrounded by a large pump-free region. Spin-polarized atoms that diffuse out of the optical pumping region precess in the ambient magnetic field and are detected by a probe laser. Four such magnetometers, at the corners of a 7 cm square, are configured for gradiometry by feeding back the output of one magnetometer to a field coil to null uniform magnetic field noise at frequencies up to 200 Hz.

12219,Clinical utility of an immunoradiometric assay for parathyroid hormone (1-84) in primary hyperparathyroidism.,"The reliable diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism depends on the measurement of PTH. The PTH assays in widespread use measure not only the hormone but also hormone fragments, thus limiting the clinical utility of the assays. A new immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) using an antigenic determinant at the extreme amino-terminal of the PTH molecule detects only full-length PTH (1-84). We compared three PTH assays and determined the presence of PTH (1-84) and PTH fragments in serum and parathyroid adenomas of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. We studied 56 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. PTH levels were increased in 63% using the midmolecule RIA; in 73% in the ""intact"" IRMA; and in 96% in the PTH (1-84)-IRMA. The PTH (1-84)-IRMA correlated with the other assays (midmolecule RIA R = +0.736; P < 0.0001; ""intact""-IRMA R = +0.951; P < 0.0001) and indices of disease activity (serum calcium R = +0.511, P < 0.0001; alkaline phosphatase R = +0.489, P = 0.001; and radius bone density R = -0.366, P < 0.01). In 21 consecutive patients undergoing parathyroidectomy, 18 had parathyroid adenomas. Intact PTH was higher than PTH (1-84)-IRMA in both serum and glandular homogenates from these patients. Similar proportions of PTH (1-84) and hormone fragments were found in both adenomas [66 +/- 3% of ""intact"" PTH-reflected PTH (1-84) and sera (73 +/- 2% of ""intact"" PTH reflected PTH (1-84)]. We conclude that the PTH (1-84)-IRMA offers improved diagnostic sensitivity in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism than other currently available assays. This study also provides evidence that both PTH (1-84) and PTH fragments are produced in parathyroid adenomas and that peripheral metabolism of hormone and fragment does not alter the proportion of bioactive hormone.","['Adenoma', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperparathyroidism', 'Immunoradiometric Assay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parathyroid Glands', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Parathyroid Neoplasms']",14557447,"[['C04.557.470.035'], ['D23.050.550'], ['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C19.642.355'], ['E05.478.566.639.405', 'E05.601.470.639.405'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A06.300.560'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['C04.588.322.525', 'C04.588.443.680', 'C19.344.525', 'C19.642.713']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
49373,Variations of the circadian rhythm of cAMP in bronchial asthma after administration of fenoterol.,"In the study of the physiology and therapeutic response of bronchial asthma the evaluation of adrenergic activity is of fundamental importance. References in the literature indicate a reduction of the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP in asthmatic patients, as well as a reduction in the response to beta-adrenergic stimulants. This work intends to expose the possible effects of the prolonged administration of beta-stimulants (as employed in bronchial asthma therapy) on the levels of circulating cyclic nucleotides. From another perspective, we wish to relate the clinical improvement after beta-adrenergic therapy and the levels of cyclic AMP. Ten patients suffering from bronchial asthma were selected for the study, and cyclic AMP levels were determined at different hours during the day (in order to evaluate its circadian rhythm), before and after treatment with 5 mg of Fenoterol (beta-stimulant), three times a day during 20 days. The results showed a statistically significant (p less than 0.002) reduction in the levels of cyclic AMP in the asthmatics. An increase in circulating cyclic AMP was observed after treatment, remaining high throughout the day, and differing from pre-treatment levels by 4.9 p.Moles after 9 hours to 2 p.Moles 13 hours after initiation of treatment. Prolonged administration of Fenoterol modifies the circadian rhythm of cyclic AMP, causing an increase in its circulating levels. The magnitude of this increase is of less amplitude than the one observed after the administration of a single dose of Fenoterol and immediate determination.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asthma', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Ethanolamines', 'Female', 'Fenoterol', 'Humans', 'Male']",6258414,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['G07.180.562.190'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['D02.033.100.291', 'D02.033.375.291', 'D02.092.063.291'], ['D02.033.100.291.465.300', 'D02.092.063.291.465.300', 'D02.092.311.660.300', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.660.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
47837,Competitive sorption and desorption of trace elements by Tunisian Aridisols Calcorthids.,"The sorption and retention processes play an important role in determining the bioavaibility and fate of trace elements in soils. Sorption and desorption of Pb(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), and Co(2+) in three Tunisian Aridisols Calcorthids (AR1, AR2, and AR3) were studied using batch experiments. Sorption and retention capacities were determined by means of K r parameter and they were related to soil properties. The results showed that in all studied soils, K r values for Pb(2+) and Cu(2+) were higher than those of Zn(2+), Ni(2+), and Co(2+) indicating that soils have higher affinity for the first ones. The high sorption and retention capacity of the three studied soils is ascribed to their alkaline pH and their high carbonates contents favoring the precipitation of these elements. Moreover, bivariate correlation analysis showed that sorption and retention of the studied cations was also strongly correlated with clay fraction and Fe oxides contents. All soils show high sorption irreversibility of Pb(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), and Co(2+). The soils with highest sorption capacity show also the highest irreversibility.","['Adsorption', 'Aluminum Silicates', 'Clay', 'Ferric Compounds', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Trace Elements', 'Tunisia']",25772874,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['D01.056.050.075', 'D01.578.725.025', 'D01.650.550.050.075', 'D01.837.725.700.760.050'], ['D20.721.250', 'G01.311.820.250', 'G16.500.275.815.250', 'N06.230.600.250'], ['D01.490.100'], ['D20.721', 'G01.311.820', 'G16.500.275.815', 'N06.230.600'], ['D27.888.284.756'], ['D01.268.811', 'D27.505.696.494.555', 'G07.203.300.681.500.555', 'J02.500.681.500.555'], ['Z01.058.266.887']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
5355,A further prospective evaluation of an equation to predict daily lithium dose.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, one prospective study confirmed the safety and accuracy of a lithium-dose prediction equation created by Zetin et al., but no definitive conclusion on the reliability of the equation has been established as yet.METHOD: The authors applied the Zetin et al. equation to 18 chronic male schizophrenic inpatients. Predicted doses to reach the serum lithium concentration of 0.4 mmol/L were calculated and prescribed in the form of lithium capsules. At Weeks 1 and 3 after treatment initiation, morning blood samples were collected about 12 hours after the last lithium dose for the measurement of serum lithium concentrations.RESULTS: None of the 18 patients achieved the desired concentration (0.4 mmol/L) exactly. The mean +/- SD of serum lithium concentrations at Week 1 was 1.01 +/- 0.29 mmol/L (range, 0.2-1.5) and at Week 3 was 0.94 +/- 0.35 mmol/L (range, 0.2-1.8). Lithium concentrations were lower than 0.4 mmol/L in only 1 patient and were higher than 0.4 mmol/L in the other 17 patients. The deviations from the unexpected value were significantly correlated with the renal function (blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels) but not with the neuroleptic doses administered to the patients. Moreover, our patients were relatively older and weighed relatively less than the patients described in the previous prospective study.CONCLUSION: The Zetin et al. equation cannot always accurately predict a required lithium dose. Renal function data, even when they range within normal values, may be useful to improve the accuracy of the equation, particularly in patients who are older or weigh less than the norm.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Blood Urea Nitrogen', 'Chronic Disease', 'Creatinine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Lithium Carbonate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Schizophrenia']",7737958,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.115', 'E01.370.390.400.100', 'E05.200.124.100.115'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['E02.319.283'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.390.400'], ['D01.045.125.500', 'D01.200.275.150.550', 'D01.510.475'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['F03.700.750']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
41576,Potential differences in kidney allograft outcomes between ethnicities when converting to sirolimus base immunosuppression.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether ethnicity impacts graft outcomes in kidney transplant patients converted to sirolimus (SRL) and maintained on either calcineurin inhibitors (CI) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with steroids.METHODS: This study analyzed kidney transplants converted to SRL and transplanted between July 1991 and April 2007. Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1: African-Americans converted to SRL + CI; group 2: non-African-Americans converted to SRL + CI; group 3: African-Americans converted to SRL + MMF; group 4: non-African-Americans converted to SRL + MMF.RESULTS: A total of 242 patients was included. Demographics, baseline immunosuppression, and reason for SRL conversion were similar among groups. Patients converted to SRL + CI regimens had significantly higher rates of acute rejection before SRL conversion, but equal rates after conversion. Development of proteinuria was similar across groups. African-American patients converted to SRL + MMF tended to have poorer outcomes compared with African-American patients converted to SRL + CI. Non-African-American patients converted to SRL + MMF tended to have better graft outcomes compared with non-African-American patients converted to SRL + CI.CONCLUSIONS: African-Americans converted to SRL may benefit from continued CI, whereas non-African-Americans converted to SRL seem to have better outcomes with MMF.

36389,Can Biomimetic Zinc Compounds Assist a (3 + 2) Cycloaddition Reaction? A Theoretical Perspective.,"Compounds bearing tetrazole rings are valuable facets in numerous branches of chemistry including metabolic imaging and the production of drugs and high-energy materials. Synthesis of tetrazoles with the help of organocatalysts has intensively been explored, while enzyme-directed click chemistry has attracted less attention and was only used in inhibitor design so far. Herein, we have investigated the possibility of a biomimetic catalyst based on a Lewis acid approach by exploring the anionic cycloaddition of azide and acetonitrile catalyzed by ZnBr2 in comparison with different biomimetic Zn(II) models. Density functional based calculations in the gas phase and with implicit solvation indicate that a variety of bioinspired zinc complexes should be able to catalyze tetrazole formation with catalytic enhancements comparable to zinc bromide salts. Such bioinspired routes could provide new possibilities for the stereo- and regioselectively controlled synthesis of tetrazoles.","['Azides', 'Biomimetic Materials', 'Bromides', 'Catalysis', 'Cycloaddition Reaction', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nitriles', 'Zinc Compounds']",29073762,"[['D01.625.100', 'D02.159'], ['J01.637.087'], ['D01.139.300.050', 'D01.248.497.158.125'], ['G02.130'], ['E05.197.406', 'J01.897.836.249.374'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G02.111.570.820'], ['D02.626'], ['D01.975']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

However, cyanosis resulting from drug-induced, asymptomatic methaemoglobinaemia is rare and is likely to go undetected preoperatively. Patients presenting with asymptomatic methaemoglobinaemia may, therefore, offer a dramatic challenge to the unprepared anaesthetist.

28308,Survivin expression by metastatic melanoma predicts poor disease outcome in patients receiving adjuvant polyvalent vaccine.,"Survivin and livin are members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. We hypothesized that elevated expression levels of these 2 IAP genes in resected advanced-stage metastatic melanoma lesions would be associated with poor disease outcome in patients receiving a polyvalent therapeutic cancer vaccine (Canvaxintrade mark). A quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT) assay for survivin and livin genes was used to assess mRNA expression in 63 metastatic melanomas obtained during cytoreductive surgery of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IV melanoma. Nineteen of 63 metastatic melanoma patients received Canvaxin pre- and postoperatively, and 37 patients received only postoperative Canvaxin. Expression of survivin and livin protein was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and then correlated with mRNA. Survivin mRNA was detected in 62 of 63 (98%) melanoma specimens ranging from 0-5.96 x 10(4) mRNA copies of total RNA. Lower mRNA copy levels of survivin significantly correlated with improved overall survival among the 37 patients who received Canvaxin postoperatively but not preoperatively (log-rank test, p = 0.023). Among patients with low survivin mRNA copies, those who received postoperative Canvaxin did significantly better than patients who received pre- and postoperative Canvaxin (p = 0.003). Livin mRNA was detectable in 60 of 63 (95%) metastatic melanoma specimens but had no significant prognostic utility. These studies demonstrate that lower levels of survivin in recurrent metastatic melanomas are associated with significantly improved survival in patients receiving postoperative adjuvant immunotherapy. Overall, the study indicates survivin expression in metastatic melanomas can significantly influence disease outcome and patient responses to immunotherapy.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivin']",15986442,"[['D12.644.360.024', 'D12.776.157.057', 'D12.776.476.024'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D20.215.894.200'], ['E02.186'], ['G05.297'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E02.095.465.425'], ['D08.811.464.938.750.210', 'D12.644.360.075.437', 'D12.776.476.075.437'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510', 'C04.557.665.510'], ['D12.776.220.600.450', 'D12.776.631.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.650', 'C23.550.727.650'], ['D12.776.624'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E01.789'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['E04'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['D12.644.360.075.437.625', 'D12.776.167.576', 'D12.776.220.600.450.495', 'D12.776.476.075.437.625']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

Certain non-structural proteins and the major basic internal protein are the main phosphoproteins detected in infected cells. The polyhedron protein was not phosphorylated. Many cell proteins continue to be phosphorylated throughout infection. Pulse-chase experiments have shown that some polypeptides are stably phosphorylated whereas other polypeptides (including the major basic protein) have phosphates which cycle on and off. One polypeptide was substantially labelled only after a chase with unlabelled orthophosphate.

26029,A randomized controlled trial of postcrisis suicide prevention.,"OBJECTIVE: This study tested the hypothesis that professionals' maintenance of long-term contact with persons who are at risk of suicide can exert a suicide-prevention influence. This influence was hypothesized to result from the development of a feeling of connectedness and to be most pertinent to high-risk individuals who refuse to remain in the health care system.METHODS: A total of 3,005 persons hospitalized because of a depressive or suicidal state, populations known to be at risk of subsequent suicide, were contacted 30 days after discharge about follow-up treatment. A total of 843 patients who had refused ongoing care were randomly divided into two groups; persons in one group were contacted by letter at least four times a year for five years. The other group-the control group-received no further contact. A follow-up procedure identified patients who died during the five-year contact period and during the subsequent ten years. Suicide rates in the contact and no-contact groups were compared.RESULTS: Patients in the contact group had a lower suicide rate in all five years of the study. Formal survival analyses revealed a significantly lower rate in the contact group (p=.04) for the first two years; differences in the rates gradually diminished, and by year 14 no differences between groups were observed.CONCLUSIONS: A systematic program of contact with persons who are at risk of suicide and who refuse to remain in the health care system appears to exert a significant preventive influence for at least two years. Diminution of the frequency of contact and discontinuation of contact appear to reduce and eventually eliminate this preventive influence.","['Adult', 'Aftercare', 'California', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Postal Service', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Suicide', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Refusal']",11376235,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E02.760.169.063', 'N02.421.585.169.063', 'N04.590.233.727.210.063'], ['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['F03.600.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.451.617'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['F01.145.126.980.875', 'I01.880.735.856'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['F01.100.150.750.750', 'F01.145.488.887.750', 'I01.880.604.473.650.968', 'N03.706.437.650.875', 'N05.300.150.800.750']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
5644,Using uncertainty and sensitivity analyses in socioecological agent-based models to improve their analytical performance and policy relevance.,"Agent-based models (ABMs) have been widely used to study socioecological systems. They are useful for studying such systems because of their ability to incorporate micro-level behaviors among interacting agents, and to understand emergent phenomena due to these interactions. However, ABMs are inherently stochastic and require proper handling of uncertainty. We propose a simulation framework based on quantitative uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to build parsimonious ABMs that serve two purposes: exploration of the outcome space to simulate low-probability but high-consequence events that may have significant policy implications, and explanation of model behavior to describe the system with higher accuracy. The proposed framework is applied to the problem of modeling farmland conservation resulting in land use change. We employ output variance decomposition based on quasi-random sampling of the input space and perform three computational experiments. First, we perform uncertainty analysis to improve model legitimacy, where the distribution of results informs us about the expected value that can be validated against independent data, and provides information on the variance around this mean as well as the extreme results. In our last two computational experiments, we employ sensitivity analysis to produce two simpler versions of the ABM. First, input space is reduced only to inputs that produced the variance of the initial ABM, resulting in a model with output distribution similar to the initial model. Second, we refine the value of the most influential input, producing a model that maintains the mean of the output of initial ABM but with less spread. These simplifications can be used to 1) efficiently explore model outcomes, including outliers that may be important considerations in the design of robust policies, and 2) conduct explanatory analysis that exposes the smallest number of inputs influencing the steady state of the modeled system.","['Agriculture', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Ecosystem', 'Environmental Policy', 'Geography', 'Michigan', 'Models, Biological', 'Probability', 'Soil', 'Uncertainty']",25340764,"[['J01.040'], ['L01.224.160'], ['J01.256', 'N06.230.080'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['I01.655.500.608.180', 'I01.880.604.825.608.180', 'N03.623.500.608.180', 'N06.230.204'], ['H01.277.500'], ['Z01.107.567.875.350.500', 'Z01.107.567.875.510.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['D20.721', 'G01.311.820', 'G16.500.275.815', 'N06.230.600'], ['E05.318.740.600.900', 'F02.463.785.373.820', 'G17.680.875', 'N05.715.360.750.625.850', 'N06.850.520.830.600.900']]","['Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
35440,Maternal behavior predicts neural underpinnings of inhibitory control in preschoolers.,"Separate lines of research have revealed that the rapid development of inhibitory control in the preschool period is closely tied to normative brain development and influenced by early mother-child interactions. One potential theory is that maternal behavior in the context of early interactions influences the neural underpinnings of inhibitory control in development, with implications for child behavior. The purpose of this paper was to examine whether maternal emotional support, measured during a mother-child problem-solving game, predicted child neural responses (frontal-central N2 event-related potential) and behavioral performance (discrimination index, d') in a go/no-go task of inhibitory control in a large, diverse sample of mother-child dyads (N = 276) observed in children's last year of preschool (mean age = 56 months). Results of a structural equation model revealed significant direct effects from maternal emotional support to child right hemisphere frontal-central N2 responses to no-go (inhibitory control) trials; greater observed emotional support predicted larger N2 responses. Larger right hemisphere N2 responses to no-go trials were also associated with better overall observed task performance (d'). A test of indirect effects from maternal emotional support to child observed performance via right hemisphere N2 responses was significant, suggesting that underlying neurophysiology is one mechanism through which maternal emotional support is associated with a child's rapidly developing inhibitory control behavior in the preschool period. This work joins a growing literature demonstrating that caregiver behavior within a ""normative"" range is an important environmental factor contributing to the development of neural processes supporting child functioning.","['Adult', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Executive Function', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibition, Psychological', 'Male', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Social Support']",29806227,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.145.179'], ['F01.525.200', 'G07.345.374.750'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['G07.265.216.500', 'G11.561.200.500'], ['F02.463.217'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.544', 'F02.463.425.475', 'F02.739.794.405'], ['F01.829.263.370.215'], ['F01.829.263.370.290.170'], ['I01.880.853.500.600']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
7830,Talker- and language-specific effects on speech intelligibility in noise assessed with bilingual talkers: Which language is more robust against noise and reverberation?,"OBJECTIVE: Investigate talker- and language-specific aspects of speech intelligibility in noise and reverberation using highly comparable matrix sentence tests across languages.DESIGN: Matrix sentences spoken by German/Russian and German/Spanish bilingual talkers were recorded. These sentences were used to measure speech reception thresholds (SRTs) with native listeners in the respective languages in different listening conditions (stationary and fluctuating noise, multi-talker babble, reverberated speech-in-noise condition).STUDY SAMPLE: Four German/Russian and four German/Spanish bilingual talkers; 20 native German-speaking, 10 native Russian-speaking, and 10 native Spanish-speaking listeners.RESULTS: Across-talker SRT differences of up to 6 dB were found for both groups of bilinguals. SRTs of German/Russian bilingual talkers were the same in both languages. SRTs of German/Spanish bilingual talkers were higher when they talked in Spanish than when they talked in German. The benefit from listening in the gaps was similar across all languages. The detrimental effect of reverberation was larger for Spanish than for German and Russian.CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations set by the number and slight accentedness of talkers and other possible confounding factors, talker- and test-condition-dependent differences were isolated from the language effect: Russian and German exhibited similar intelligibility in noise and reverberation, whereas Spanish was more impaired in these situations.","['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Auditory Threshold', 'Comprehension', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multilingualism', 'Noise', 'Observer Variation', 'Perceptual Masking', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recognition, Psychology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sound Spectrography', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Reception Threshold Test', 'Vibration', 'Voice Quality', 'Young Adult']",26486466,"[['E02.037', 'E02.190.888.030', 'E05.723.136'], ['H01.671.031'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F02.463.593.071.173', 'F02.463.593.710.190', 'G07.888.125.173'], ['F02.463.188.357'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.559.423.452'], ['G01.750.770.776.567', 'G16.500.275.600', 'N06.230.400', 'N06.850.460.610'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['F02.463.593.071.594', 'F02.463.593.932.733', 'G07.888.125.594'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['F02.463.425.540.706'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.855'], ['G11.561.812.650', 'G11.561.820'], ['F01.145.209.908.677.610', 'G11.561.812.686'], ['F02.463.593.071.875', 'G07.888.125.875'], ['E01.370.382.375.060.060.760'], ['G01.374.930'], ['G09.772.925.960'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0
5415,Role of phospholipase A2 in the induction of drip loss in porcine muscle.,"The role of phospholipase A2 in the induction of drip loss from pig muscle has been investigated. In samples from porcine M. longissimus dorsi, total PLA2 activity as well as mRNA and protein levels of the group VIA iPLA2 (iPLA2-VIA) increased during the initial 4 h post-mortem period. Morphological studies of porcine muscle showed that at 4 h post-mortem, gaps had formed between muscle fibers and that the sarcolemma membrane borders appeared blurred. At the same time iPLA2-VIA protein levels were increased inside muscle fibers and at the sarcolemma. iPLA2-VIA mRNA abundance in samples from different breeds of pigs with variations in drip loss revealed no clear correlation between drip loss level and iPLA2-VIA expression. Together, these data indicate that during the post-mortem period, iPLA2-VIA expression and activity is increased at the muscle fiber membranes. PLA2 activity may affect membrane permeability and consequently the progression of drip formation in porcine muscle.","['Animals', 'Body Water', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Phospholipases A', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Postmortem Changes', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Swine']",17288434,"[['B01.050'], ['A12.207.200'], ['G02.300'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.680.750'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.680.750.937'], ['C23.550.260.224.617'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
29899,Narcissistic vulnerability is a common cause for depression in patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.,"The aim of this study was to assess for the first time different dimensions of narcissistic self-regulation in a large cohort of adult patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) (n=50). From preliminary studies it is suggested that narcissistic personality trait and disorder, respectively, are relatively uncommon and occur in only 6-10% of GTS patients. In this study we used the Narcissism Inventory (NI), a 163-items questionnaire that measures four different dimensions of narcissism. The main result was that the prevalence of narcissism strongly depends on the subtype of narcissism: while the vulnerable narcissism (""threatened self"" and ""hypochondriac self"") was common, the ""classic narcissistic self"" (grandiose narcissism) was rare. From our data an association between comorbid depression and increased values of the ""threatened self"" and comorbid OCD with increased values of the ""hypochondriac self"" is suggested. Narcissism correlated positively with the personality domain neuroticism and had a significantly negative impact on patients' quality of life. Therefore it can be speculated that vulnerable narcissism is - among several others - one cause for depression in patients with GTS. These findings may open new psychotherapeutic perspectives in the treatment of depression in patients with GTS.","['Adult', 'Comorbidity', 'Depression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mood Disorders', 'Narcissism', 'Personality Disorders', 'Personality Inventory', 'Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tourette Syndrome', 'Young Adult']",26548979,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F03.600'], ['F02.739.794.582'], ['F03.675'], ['F04.711.647.513'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['C10.228.140.079.898', 'C10.228.662.825.800', 'C10.574.500.850', 'C16.320.400.820', 'F03.625.992.850'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

38698,Tacrolimus suppresses tumour necrosis factor-alpha and protects against splanchnic artery occlusion shock.,"1. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) is a pleiotropic cytokine which is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of splanchnic artery occlusion (SAO) shock. Tacrolimus, formerly known as FK506, is a macrolide antibiotic, that blocks the transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha. 2. Male anaesthetized rats were subjected to clamping of the splanchnic arteries for 45 min. This surgical procedure resulted in an irreversible state of shock (SAO shock). Sham operated animals were used as controls. SAO shocked rats had a decreased survival rate (0% at 4 h of reperfusion, while sham shocked rats survived more than 4 h), enhanced serum TNF-alpha concentrations (415+/-12 U ml(-1)), decreased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), leukopenia and increased ileal leukocyte accumulation studied by means of myeloperoxidase activity (MPO=7.5+/-0.3 U g(-1) tissue). Moreover aortic rings from shocked rats showed a marked hyporeactivity to phenylephrine (PE, 1 nM - 10 microM), reduced responsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh, 10 nM - 10 microM) and increased staining for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Furthermore increased mRNA for TNF-alpha was observed in peritoneal macrophages of SAO shocked rats. 3. Tacrolimus (100 microg kg(-1), 5 min after splanchnic arteries occlusion) increased survival rate (SAO + Tacrolimus = 100% at 4 h of reperfusion), reverted the marked hypotension, reduced serum TNF-alpha (15+/-3 U ml(-1)), ameliorated leukopenia, reduced ileal MPO (0.9+/-0.01 U g(-1) tissue), restored to control values the hyporeactivity to PE. improved the reduced responsiveness to ACh and blunted the enhanced immunostaining for ICAM-1 in the aorta. Finally tacrolimus suppressed cytokine mRNA levels in peritoneal macrophages. 4. The data suggest that tacrolimus may represent a new therapeutic approach in circulatory shock.","['Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Constriction, Pathologic', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular', 'Peroxidase', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Shock', 'Splanchnic Circulation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tacrolimus', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",10385251,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['C23.300.287'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['D27.505.696.477.656'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595', 'E05.200.625.107.595', 'E05.242.195.107.595', 'G04.140.107.595', 'G09.188.105.595'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['G11.427.494'], ['A02.633.570.491', 'A07.015.733.500', 'A10.690.467.491'], ['D08.811.682.732.700'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['C23.550.835'], ['G09.330.100.881'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['D02.540.505.810'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
29896,Unique characteristics of ubiquitin-bonded complex play a pathological role in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy.,"Abnormal complex formation of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) protein and pathological ubiquitination of abnormal complex are two pathological processes involved in DRPLA neurodegeneration. Pathological ubiquitination and solubility in SDS and reducing agent are two unique characteristics of the DRPLA protein complex. Ubiquitination of abnormal DRPLA protein complex in DRPLA brain tissue is heat-resistant and stronger than that in control brain tissue. Pathological ubiquitination of DRPLA protein complex correlates with the onset of symptoms and the size of an expanded glutamine repeat in brain tissue of patients with DRPLA. Pathological ubiquitination plays an important role in DRPLA pathology. DRPLA protein complex is water-insoluble but soluble in SDS and reducing agent, and displays no difference in water insolubility between control and DRPLA brain tissue. Abnormal insoluble complex formation is not developed by a qualitative change in water insolubility of DRPLA protein complex but is developed by a spontaneous accumulation of an abnormally large amount of the DRPLA protein complex.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myoclonic Epilepsies, Progressive', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Solubility', 'Ubiquitins']",10527837,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C10.228.140.380.100', 'C10.574.945.249', 'F03.615.400.100'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C10.228.140.490.375.130.650', 'C10.228.140.490.493.063.650'], ['D12.776.631'], ['C10.574'], ['G02.805'], ['D12.776.947']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Thus, we integrated faster libraries for numerical calculations, improved data retrieving algorithms and have optimized the source code. Importantly, to adapt to rapidly growing file sizes, we developed a generalizable compression scheme for very fast random access and applied this concept to mzML files to retrieve spectral data.Results: pymzML performs at par with established C programs when it comes to processing times. However, it offers the versatility of a scripting language, while adding unprecedented fast random access to compressed files. Additionally, we designed our compression scheme in such a general way that it can be applied to any field where fast random access to large data blocks in compressed files is desired.Availability and implementation: pymzML is freely available on https://github.com/pymzML/pymzML under GPL license. pymzML requires Python3.4+ and optionally numpy.

43753,Learning to assist smokers through encounters with standardized patients: An innovative training for physicians in an Eastern European country.,"OBJECTIVES: A lack of physician training is a major obstacle for effective tobacco dependence treatment. This study assessed the feasibility of an active learning training program and its effects on smoking cessation counselling skills of medical residents in Armenia, an Eastern European country with high smoking prevalence.STUDY DESIGN: The study used a pre-post assessment of smoking cessation counselling activities and a course evaluation survey to assess the feasibility of the intervention in a different environment.METHODS: We adapted an active learning training model developed in Switzerland. Residents were trained in Yerevan, Armenia, using video-taped counselling sessions, role plays, standardized patients (actors), group discussions and immediate feedback. The training evaluation was done using a semi-structured anonymous questionnaire. The study assessed the physicians' self-reported smoking cessation counselling activities before and 6 months after the training. A non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to assess pre-post differences in physicians' counselling skills measured on ordinal scale.RESULTS: Of the 37 residents trained, 75% were female, 89% aged 20-29 years and 83% were never-smokers. Twenty-eight trainees (76%) returned the course evaluation survey and 32 (86%) answered a questionnaire on skills self-assessment at 6 months follow-up. The majority agreed the course was successful in achieving its learning objectives (64%-96%) and increased their confidence in assisting their patients to quit (74%). After 6 months, the physicians were more likely than at baseline to adhere to evidence-based counselling strategies, including assessing the smoking status and dependence and matching the advice to the patient motivation. The training did not, however, improve the prescription of tobacco dependence medications.CONCLUSIONS: Six months after the training, several self-reported smoking cessation counselling activities had significantly improved compared to baseline. This training model is acceptable for medical residents in Yerevan, Armenia and offers a promising approach in addressing the lack of physician counselling skills in similar settings and populations.","['Adult', 'Armenia', 'Counseling', 'Education, Medical, Continuing', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Educational', 'Patient Simulation', 'Physicians', 'Problem-Based Learning', 'Program Evaluation', 'Smokers', 'Smoking Cessation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tobacco Use Disorder', 'Young Adult']",31557211,"[['M01.060.116'], ['Z01.542.900.099', 'Z01.542.931.099', 'Z01.586.035.150', 'Z01.586.950.099'], ['F02.784.176', 'F04.408.413', 'N02.421.143.303', 'N02.421.461.363'], ['I02.358.212.350', 'I02.358.399.250'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.599.545', 'I02.903.302'], ['I02.903.847.500'], ['M01.526.485.810', 'N02.360.810'], ['F02.463.425.720', 'I02.158.660', 'I02.903.565'], ['E05.337.820', 'N04.761.685', 'N05.715.360.650'], ['M01.808'], ['F01.145.488.732'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['C25.775.912', 'F03.900.912'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
8424,Designed miniaturization of microfluidic biosensor platforms using the stop-flow technique.,"Here, we present a novel approach to increase the degree of miniaturization as well as the sensitivity of biosensor platforms by the optimization of microfluidic stop-flow techniques independent of the applied detection technique (e.g. electrochemical or optical). The readout of the labeled bioassays, immobilized in a microfluidic channel, under stop-flow conditions leads to a rectangular shaped peak signal. Data evaluation using the peak height allows for a high level miniaturization of the channel geometries. To study the main advantages and limitations of this method by numerical simulations, a universally applicable model system is introduced for the first time. Consequently, proof-of-principle experiments were successfully performed with standard and miniaturized versions of an electrochemical biosensor platform utilizing a repressor protein-based assay for tetracycline antibiotics. Herein, the measured current peak heights are the same despite the sextuple reduction of the channel dimensions. Thus, this results in a 22-fold signal amplification compared to the constant flow measurements in the case of the miniaturized version.","['Biosensing Techniques', 'Humans', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniaturization', 'Tetracyclines']",27747319,"[['E05.601.043'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.588.465'], ['E05.830.666', 'H01.671.808.500', 'J01.897.520.500.500'], ['J01.897.520'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.900', 'D04.615.562.900']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
23341,Technical Considerations for Implementation of Tele-Ethics Consultation in the Intensive Care Unit.,"BACKGROUND: Robust ethics consultation services cannot be sustained by all hospitals; consultative service from a high-volume center via teleconferencing is an attractive alternative. This pilot study was conceived to explore the feasibility and understand the practical implications of offering such a service.METHODS: High-definition videoconferencing was used to provide real-time interaction between the rounding clinicians and a remote clinical ethicist. Data collection included: (1) evaluation of the hardware and software required for teleconferencing, and (2) comparison of ethics trigger counts between the remote and on-site ethicist during rounds.RESULTS: Issues with audio represented the majority of technical problems. Once technical difficulties were addressed, the on-site ethicist's count of ""triggers"" was not statistically different from the count of the remote ethicist.CONCLUSION: Remote clinical ethics rounding is feasible when the equipment is optimized. Remote ethicists can identify similar numbers of ""triggers"" for possible ethical issues when compared to on-site ethicist numbers.","['Ethicists', 'Ethics Consultation', 'Ethics, Clinical', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Pilot Projects']",30605438,"[['K01.752.566.479.119', 'M01.526.276', 'N05.350.262'], ['K01.752.566.479.117.200', 'N04.452.758.849.174', 'N05.350.250.200'], ['K01.752.566.479.045.500', 'K01.752.566.479.171.132', 'N05.350.200.500', 'N05.350.340.162'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N02.278.388.493'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720']]","['Humanities [K]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Enzyme activity is reported in I.U./l, based on the molar absorption coefficient of o-dianisidine consumed. The substrate is stable and is not subject to non-enzymatic oxidation. Comparison with a manual reference end-point assay using the same substrate indicates good correlation of the bichromatic and centrifugal methods.

8391,Role of the sympathetic innervation on uterine electromyographic activity in nonpregnant ovariectomized sheep under estrogen supplementation.,"The aims of the present study were to characterize the sympathetic innervation of the nonpregnant sheep uterus, to determine the catecholamine content in myometrium (MYO) and endometrium, and to study the effects of chemical sympathectomy (CHSPX) on uterine catecholamine content and on uterine electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded from the MYO and mesometrium (MESO) in the nonpregnant ovariectomized sheep. After synchronization of estrus, 9 nonpregnant sheep were anesthetized with halothane, ovariectomized, and fitted with vascular catheters and EMG electrodes. Estradiol-17 beta was administered intravascularly at a rate of 50 micrograms/24 h for 10 days. CHSPX was induced with 6-hydroxy dopamine (20 mg/kg). Uterine tissues were obtained for determination of catecholamine content by HPLC and for immunocytochemical staining using an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). In nonpregnant ovariectomized sheep, TH immunostaining was present in nerve fibers located in endometrium and MYO. In all layers of the uterus, catecholamine fibers were found in the proximity of blood vessels as well as in defined regions of the parenchyma. Throughout the uterus, norepinephrine content and TH immunostaining were dramatically decreased after CHSPX. CHSPX decreased uterine short EMG event activity in both MYO and MESO. Contracture-type activity was not affected in MYO and was increased in MESO. We conclude that sympathetic innervation modulates the MYO and MESO EMG activity in nonpregnant ovariectomized sheep under estradiol supplementation, and that the removal of the sympathetic innervation induces a decrease in the spontaneous activity.","['Animals', 'Dinoprost', 'Dopamine', 'Electromyography', 'Endometrium', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Myometrium', 'Norepinephrine', 'Ovariectomy', 'Oxidopamine', 'Sheep', 'Sympathectomy, Chemical', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase', 'Uterus']",1352148,"[['B01.050'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.400.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.400.200'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['A05.360.319.679.490'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['A02.633.570.500', 'A05.360.319.679.690', 'A10.690.467.500'], ['D02.033.100.291.502', 'D02.092.063.480', 'D02.092.211.215.746', 'D02.092.311.830', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.830'], ['E04.270.282.685', 'E04.950.165.685', 'E04.950.300.680'], ['D02.092.311.342.478.650', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342.478.650'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['E04.525.210.105.800.800'], ['A08.800.050.800'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.923', 'D12.776.556.579.374.925'], ['A05.360.319.679']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
55,Clinical evaluation of fiber-reinforced composite inlay FPDs.,"PURPOSE: This clinical study evaluated the behavior of inlay fixed partial dentures (IFPD) with conventional and modified framework designs over a period of 12 to 48 months.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one glass fiber-reinforced composite IFPDs were made to replace one missing maxillary or mandibular tooth. The frameworks were made only with parallel fibers in 19 restorations (group 1) and built with parallel and woven fibers modifying the design of the pontic element in 22 IFPDs (group 2) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All restorations were evaluated by color match, marginal discoloration, secondary caries, surface texture, marginal adaptation, fracture, and postoperative sensitivity.RESULTS: Three partial adhesive-cohesive veneering composite fractures occurred in the pontic element in group 1 after 3, 4, and 8 months, respectively. One cohesive fracture occurred in an abutment in group 2 after 46 months. Group 1 showed a 16% fracture failure rate; group 2 showed a 5% failure rate. However, no statistical difference was detected between the groups. IFPDs received the highest score at the following rates: color match 71%, marginal discoloration 96%, secondary caries 99%, surface texture 88%, marginal adaptation 98%, fracture 90%, and postoperative sensitivity 100%. Statistical analysis indicated significant deterioration of color match from baseline to last recall.CONCLUSION: There were nonsignificantly fewer fractures of the veneering composite with the modified design of the framework than with the conventional design. Repair of the fractured veneer of IFPDs may lengthen the lifespan of the restorations, but it is advisable only for slight damage.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cementation', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Composite Resins', 'Dental Restoration Failure', 'Denture Design', 'Denture Repair', 'Denture, Partial, Fixed', 'Female', 'Glass', 'Glass Ionomer Cements', 'Humans', 'Inlays', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Resin Cements', 'Silicate Cement', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis']",12854799,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.170', 'E06.095.170'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['D05.750.716.822.308', 'D25.339.816.500', 'D25.720.716.822.308', 'J01.637.051.339.816.500', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.308'], ['E06.323.400', 'E06.780.346.725'], ['E06.780.346.760.300', 'E06.912.250'], ['E06.780.346.760.500', 'E06.912.285'], ['E06.780.346.760.943.271', 'E07.695.190.200.220.220'], ['J01.637.437'], ['D25.339.291.402', 'J01.637.051.339.291.402'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E06.323.428.275', 'E06.780.346.737.500', 'E07.695.190.190.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['D05.750.716.822.730', 'D25.339.291.750', 'D25.720.716.822.730', 'J01.637.051.339.291.750', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.730'], ['D25.339.291.800', 'J01.637.051.339.291.800'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
29796,Application of hydrogen peroxide for the removal of toxic cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton from wastewater.,"Phytoplankton blooms containing elevated levels of cyanobacteria are common in wastewatertreatment plants. Microcystis aeruginosa, the most common freshwater cyanobacterial species, produces the hepatotoxin microcystin, which is a threat to human and environmental health. Blooms also affect the viability of treating and reusing water and cause problems when detritus accumulates in pipe and pumping delivery infrastructure. We proposed the application of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to induce cyanobacterial cell death. Spectral fingerprinting of phytoplankton into four groups (cyanobacteria, chlorophyta, diatoms, and cryptophyta) allowed for determination of equivalent chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations contributed by photosynthetic pigments, an indicative measure of the photosynthetic activity of each phytoplankton group. This was used to establish the effect of H2O2 addition on phytoplankton in wastewater samples. The lowest H2O2 dose that caused statistically significant exponential decay of phytoplankton groups was approximately 3.0 x 10(-3) g H2O2/microg phytoplankton chl-a. At this dose, cyanobacteria and total phytoplankton exhibited a half-life of 2.3 and 4.5 h, respectively. Cyanobacteria decayed at a rate approximately twice that of chlorophyta and diatoms, and the combined chl-a of all phytoplankton groups decreased to negligible levels within 48 h of H202 application.","['Chlorophyll', 'Chlorophyll A', 'Cyanobacteria', 'Environmental Restoration and Remediation', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Kinetics', 'Phytoplankton', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Water Purification']",19192818,"[['D03.383.129.578.840.374', 'D03.633.400.909.374', 'D04.345.783.374'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.374.140', 'D03.633.400.909.374.140', 'D04.345.783.374.140'], ['B03.280', 'B03.440.475.100'], ['N06.230.080.600', 'N06.850.460.375'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.424', 'D01.339.431.374.424', 'D01.650.550.750.400', 'D02.389.338.253'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['B05.080.500.600'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.900.900', 'N06.850.860.510.900.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

20393,Enhanced mechanical properties of thermosensitive chitosan hydrogel by silk fibers for cartilage tissue engineering.,"Articular cartilage has limited repair capability following traumatic injuries and current methods of treatment remain inefficient. Reconstructing cartilage provides a new way for cartilage repair and natural polymers are often used as scaffold because of their biocompatibility and biofunctionality. In this study, we added degummed chopped silk fibers and electrospun silk fibers to the thermosensitive chitosan/glycerophosphate hydrogels to reinforce two hydrogel constructs which were used as scaffold for hyaline cartilage regeneration. The gelation temperature and gelation time of hydrogel were analyzed by the rheometer and vial tilting method. Mechanical characterization was measured by uniaxial compression, indentation and dynamic mechanical analysis assay. Chondrocytes were then harvested from the knee joint of the New Zealand white rabbits and cultured in constructs. The cell proliferation, viability, production of glycosaminoglycans and collagen type II were assessed. The results showed that mechanical properties of the hydrogel were significantly enhanced when a hybrid with two layers of electrospun silk fibers was made. The results of GAG and collagen type II in cell-seeded scaffolds indicate support of the chondrogenic phenotype for chondrocytes with a significant increase in degummed silk fiber-hydrogel composite for GAG content and in two-layer electrospun fiber-hydrogel composite for Col II. It was concluded that these two modified scaffolds could be employed for cartilage tissue engineering.","['Animals', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Cartilage, Articular', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chitosan', 'Chondrocytes', 'Collagen Type II', 'Fibroins', 'Glycerophosphates', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate', 'Hydrogels', 'Nanofibers', 'Rabbits', 'Regeneration', 'Rheology', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Scaffolds', 'Water']",24094188,"[['B01.050'], ['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['A02.165.407.150', 'A02.835.583.192'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['D05.750.078.139.500', 'D09.698.211.500'], ['A11.329.171'], ['D05.750.078.280.300.200', 'D12.776.860.300.250.300.200'], ['D05.750.078.875.500', 'D12.776.093.750.500'], ['D02.033.800.875.750', 'D09.853.875.750', 'D09.894.299', 'D10.570.755.375'], ['D09.698.373'], ['D02.033.455.250.700.485', 'D05.750.219.500', 'D05.750.741.485', 'D20.280.320.609.500', 'D25.720.532.500', 'D25.720.741.485', 'D26.255.165.320.375.375', 'J01.637.051.720.584.500', 'J01.637.051.720.741.485'], ['D20.280.320.375', 'D26.255.165.320.375'], ['J01.637.512.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['G16.762'], ['E05.830', 'H01.671.808'], ['E05.481.500.311.500', 'J01.293.069.249.500'], ['E07.206.627', 'E07.695.825'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
43615,"Hospital privileges for family physicians. Patterns of recent residency graduates, residency director perceptions, and resident expectations.","A national mail survey was performed that examined reports of recent residency graduates about hospital privileges for family physicians, perceptions of residency program directors about the percentage of their graduates who obtain privileges, and plans of third-year residents for seeking privileges. Privileges in medicine, pediatrics, surgery, obstetrics, and coronary care/intensive care units (CCU/ICU) were examined. Questionnaires were mailed to a random sample of 308 residency graduates aged 30 to 35 years, all 383 family practice residency directors, and a random sample of 319 third-year residents. Two mailings produced an 82 percent response rate. Most recent graduates had privileges in medicine (97 percent), pediatrics (95 percent), and CCU/ICU (87 percent). A majority (64 percent) had obstetric privileges, and a minority (36 percent) had surgical privileges. Directors were accurate in their perceptions of privileges attained by graduates in medicine, pediatrics, and CCU/ICU, but underestimated the percentage who had privileges in surgery and overestimated the percentage who had privileges in obstetrics. Residents planned on seeking privileges in medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics at a rate similar to recent graduates, with lower percentages planning on seeking them in surgery and CCU/ICU.

29721,Application of Bioorganic Fertilizer Significantly Increased Apple Yields and Shaped Bacterial Community Structure in Orchard Soil.,"Application of bioorganic fertilizers has been reported to improve crop yields and change soil bacterial community structure; however, little work has been done in apple orchard soils where the biological properties of the soils are being degraded due to long-term application of chemical fertilizers. In this study, we used Illumina-based sequencing approach to characterize the bacterial community in the 0-60-cm soil profile under different fertilizer regimes in the Loess Plateau. The experiment includes three treatments: (1) control without fertilization (CK); (2) application of chemical fertilizer (CF); and (3) application of bioorganic fertilizer and organic-inorganic mixed fertilizer (BOF). The results showed that the treatment BOF increased the apple yields by 114 and 67 % compared to the CK and CF treatments, respectively. The treatment BOF also increased the soil organic matter (SOM) by 22 and 16 % compared to the CK and CF treatments, respectively. The Illumina-based sequencing showed that Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla and Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were the most abundant classes in the soil profile. The bacterial richness for ACE was increased after the addition of BOF. Compared to CK and CF treatments, BOF-treated soil revealed higher abundance of Proteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, Rhizobiales, and Xanthomonadales while Acidobacteria, Gp7, Gp17, and Sphaerobacter were found in lower abundance throughout the soil profile. Bacterial community structure varied with soil depth under different fertilizer treatments, e.g., the bacterial richness, diversity, and the relative abundance of Verruccomicrobia, Candidatus Brocadiales, and Skermanella were decreased with the soil depth in all three treatments. Permutational multivariate analysis showed that the fertilizer regime was the major factor than soil depth in the variations of the bacterial community composition. Two groups, Lysobacter and Rhodospirillaceae, were found to be the significantly increased by the BOF addition and the genus Lysobacter may identify members of this group effective in biological control-based plant disease management and the members of family Rhodospirillaceae had an important role in fixing molecular nitrogen. These results strengthen the understanding of responses to the BOF and possible interactions within bacterial communities in soil that can be associated with disease suppression and the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen. The increase of apple yields after the application of BOF might be attributed to the fact that the application of BOF increased SOM, and soil total nitrogen, and changed the bacterial community by enriching Rhodospirillaceae, Alphaprotreobateria, and Proteobacteria.","['Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biodiversity', 'Biological Control Agents', 'Carbon', 'China', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Fertilizers', 'Fruit', 'Malus', 'Microbial Consortia', 'Nitrogen', 'Nitrogen Fixation', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Diseases', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Soil', 'Soil Microbiology']",27670433,"[['B03'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G16.500.275.157.049', 'N06.230.124.049'], ['D20.215.113'], ['D01.268.150'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['D27.720.031.400'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.444'], ['G06.591.750', 'G16.500.275.157.049.100.500.750', 'N06.230.124.049.100.500.500'], ['D01.268.604', 'D01.362.625'], ['G02.111.071.630', 'G02.111.587.750', 'G02.607.560.750', 'G03.087.630', 'G06.625', 'G16.500.768.600'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['G15.610'], ['D13.444.735.686.670'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['D20.721', 'G01.311.820', 'G16.500.275.815', 'N06.230.600'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.555', 'N06.850.425.300']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1

The ultrasound unit helps avoid direct injury to the ICA. The technical advantage of this system is the miniature 1-mm diameter microvascular probe, which does not disturb the operative field. An arterial or venous flow source of even an invisible vessel can be detected easily, noninvasively, and reproducibly. Real-time information with a 100% detection rate for the ICA is helpful for predicting localization even in the intracavernous portion, where the ICA is invisible. The endoscope unit can visualize the dead angle areas of the operating microscope by varying the endoscopic gateways and display on a ""picture-in-picture"" system. The advantage of both devices is the integration with a video processor, so that the real-time information from each unit can be switched intraoperatively onto the display as required.

8997,Contrasting effects of organic and inorganic toxicants on freshwater periphyton.,"This study analyses the factors influencing the response of periphyton communities to toxicants in order to test the validity of the short-term physiological method. The effects of two model compounds, atrazine and zinc, on the photosynthesis of periphyton from different lotic systems were analyzed using short-term toxicity tests. Periphyton communities from seven sites belonging to a relatively small area were used to explore the ecological parameters affecting toxicity in flowing waters. Furthermore, time course studies of zinc toxicity on intact and suspended periphyton were carried out in order to evaluate the significance of periphyton structure (thickness) on toxicity. Atrazine toxicity varied slightly (0.42-2.42 microM) in tests with photosynthesis as an endpoint. Only environmental light was detected to lead to systematic changes in sensitivity of field collected communities. In contrast, the range of EC(10) values for zinc was very broad (7->1000 microM), and mainly related to algal biomass, while also water chemistry (alkalinity) was important. The results of time-course experiments indicated that the penetration of zinc into thick biofilms was limited. The model compounds tested in the present study may exemplify two different situations. In the case of atrazine, the effect on periphyton is easy to predict from the physiological tests used here. On the other hand, zinc toxicity assessed using photosynthesis of periphyton is much affected by many biological and chemical variables. It is concluded that toxicity tests of metals and other organic and inorganic compounds should be based on longer times of exposure.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Atrazine', 'Biofilms', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eukaryota', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Light', 'Models, Biological', 'Photosynthesis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Rheology', 'Time Factors', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute', 'Water', 'Water Pollutants', 'Zinc']",12799109,"[['G07.025', 'G16.012.500'], ['D03.383.931.247'], ['A20.593', 'G06.120'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['B01'], ['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['G02.300'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['E05.599.395'], ['G02.111.158.937', 'G02.111.669.700', 'G02.740.921', 'G03.191.937', 'G03.493.700', 'G03.800.700', 'G15.568'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.830', 'H01.671.808'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E05.940.790'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925'], ['D27.888.284.903'], ['D01.268.556.940', 'D01.268.956.906', 'D01.552.544.940']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
42339,Effect of sorghum particle size on digestibility of nutrients at the terminal ileum and over the total digestive tract of growing-finishing pigs.,"The effect of sorghum particle size on nutrient digestibilities at the terminal ileum and over the total digestive tract of growing-finishing pigs were investigated in a replicated 3 X 3 Latin square trial. Sorghum-casein diets were used. Sorghum was dry rolled (C) or ground in a hammer mill through 6.4 mm (M) or 3.2 mm (F) screens, producing particles with a modulus of fineness of 3.57, 2.85 or 2.36, respectively. Each successive reduction in particle size improved (P less than .05) the apparent ileal digestibility of dry matter, starch, gross energy and N. Measured over the total digestive tract, digestibilities of these components were highest (P less than .05) for the F diet but they did not differ (P greater than .10) between diets M and C because of increased (P less than .05) disappearance in the large intestine of dry matter, starch and gross energy from the C diet. N loss in the large intestine was also higher for pigs fed diet C than for those fed diet M, but the difference was not significant. The digestibilities of most amino acids at the terminal ileum were improved (P less than .05) as particle size decreased. Lysine digestibilities were not affected (P greater tha .10). Amino acid digestibilities measured over the total digestive tract were consistently higher (P less than .05) for diet F than diets M and C, which did not differ (P greater than .10) from one another. A comparison of ileal and total tract digestibilities indicated a net disappearance of all measured amino acids except lysine during large intestine transit. These data indicate that increasing fineness of grind will improve digestibility of nutrients in sorghum by growing-finishing pigs.","['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Caseins', 'Digestion', 'Digestive System', 'Ileum', 'Male', 'Particle Size', 'Poaceae', 'Swine']",7263529,"[['D12.125'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.256.159.750.207', 'D12.776.744.150'], ['G07.203.650.250', 'G10.261.190'], ['A03'], ['A03.556.124.684.249', 'A03.556.249.124'], ['G02.712'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

7967,On the relationship between negative affective priming and prefrontal cognitive control mechanisms.,"Although several studies have examined inhibition of affective stimuli, valence-dependent cognitive control effects remain poorly understood. Behavioural and functional imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) data were collected from 17 healthy participants to examine neural correlates of the Negative Affective Priming (NAP) task. We created relative ratio scores considering the reaction times of prime trials in order to assess the amount of interference after the presentation of negative and positive distracter words. Behavioural results showed an attenuated NAP effect for negative distracters compared to neutral stimuli. Furthermore, priming negative distracters generated more interference by reacting to the probe target than positive distracters. Neuroimaging data revealed a stronger prefrontal activation during negative NAP trials compared to positive NAP and neutral control trials, which was reflected in a heightened activation of superior and middle frontal gyrus as well as parietal cortex. The findings show the impact of negative distracters on prefrontal response, contributing to the understanding of NAP effects in healthy subjects.","['Adult', 'Affect', 'Cognition', 'Female', 'Functional Neuroimaging', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Reaction Time', 'Repetition Priming', 'Young Adult']",25648386,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.470.047'], ['F02.463.188'], ['E01.370.350.578.875', 'E01.370.376.537.625', 'E05.629.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.670'], ['E05.723.729'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270.700'], ['E05.796.817', 'F02.830.650', 'F04.669.817', 'G11.561.677'], ['F02.463.425.540.739'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

26946,The role of ubiquitin in neurotrophin receptor signalling and sorting.,"NGF (nerve growth factor) binding to TrkA (tropomyosin receptor kinase A) induces dimerization, autophosphorylation and internalization of the receptor to signalling vesicles for delivery of differentiation signals. TrkA interacts with p75 receptor through the p62-TRAF-6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) complex bridging the two receptors. The atypical protein kinase C is activated and recruited to the receptor complex as well. TrkA is Lys63-polyubiquitinated on Lys485 by the E3 (ubiquitin ligase), TRAF-6, and E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), UbcH7. Inhibition of polyubiquitination has been observed to interrupt signalling and internalization. Furthermore, an absence of p62 prevents endosomal localization and signalling. Altogether, these findings reveal Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains and the shuttling protein p62 co-ordinately regulate TrkA internalization, trafficking and sorting.","['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Receptor, trkA', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin']",17052191,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.644.276.860.100', 'D12.776.467.860.100', 'D12.776.631.600.100', 'D23.529.850.100'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.660', 'D12.776.543.750.630.496', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.550.550'], ['D12.776.543.750.750.400.550'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.776.947.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
17459,DNA repair synthesis facilitates RAD52-mediated second-end capture during DSB repair.,"Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mitotic and meiotic cells. HR occurs through a series of steps involving DSB resection, invasion of single-stranded DNA into homologous duplex DNA to form a D loop, repair synthesis, and second-end capture. We show that DNA repair synthesis, catalyzed by human DNA polymerase eta (poleta) acting upon the priming strand of a D loop, leads to capture and annealing of the second end of a resected DSB in reactions mediated by RAD52 protein. Second-end capture products were not detected when poleta was replaced by other polymerases such as poldelta or poliota. RAD52 could not be replaced by RAD51. We also found that the RAD52-dependent reaction was stimulated by the single-strand binding protein RPA, but not by E. coli SSB. Following repair synthesis and second-end capture, de novo DNA synthesis was observed from the captured second DNA end.","['Animals', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA, Single-Stranded', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Rad51 Recombinase', 'Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Replication Protein A']",18313388,"[['B01.050'], ['G05.200.210.220'], ['G02.111.222', 'G05.219'], ['D13.444.308.497', 'G02.111.570.820.486.437', 'G05.360.580.437'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.308.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['G02.111.570.820.486', 'G05.360.580'], ['D08.811.739.650.500', 'D12.776.260.695', 'D12.776.313.968'], ['D12.776.260.696'], ['G05.728'], ['D12.776.260.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
43363,Different methods to estimate total power and its components during lifting.,"A more fundamental understanding about the act of manual lifting can be provided by the assessment of the total production of power and the power generated in joints. The present study is concerned with the validity of the estimations of these parameters. Four subjects lifted an 18.8 kg load while they were filmed and ground reaction forces were measured. The total generated power was calculated in three ways: (1) by summation of joint powers, (2) on the basis of the rate of change of the summed energy contents of human body segments, and (3) on the basis of the rate of change of the body energy estimated from ground reaction forces. The results were compared. Furthermore, at a segmental level the power supplied to or absorbed from a segment was compared to the rate of change of its energy content. The resulting instantaneous power curves from the three different methods showed a high level of agreement, which supports their validity. However, some minor discrepancies were observed. The major cause of the observed difference between the rate of change of the summed segmental energy contents and the summed joint powers was found at a segmental level. It was observed that segmental link lengths (i.e. distances between proximal and distal markers) changed during movement, which yielded discrepancies between the power flow to or from a segment and the rate of change of its energy content.","['Adult', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Weight Lifting']",1517270,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.599.395'], ['I03.450.642.845.950']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
5666,Hemodynamic effects of a new right ventricular assist device.,"A right ventricular assist device (VAD) based on the principle of counterpulsation has been developed at our institution. The device is a valveless, pneumatically actuated, 40 cc, sac-type pump, with a single inlet-outlet port. For right ventricular support, the ""Uniport"" pump is anastamosed end-to-side to the pulmonary artery. In previous experimental trials, the device has been shown to impart minimal trauma to blood components. In this study, biventricular failure was induced in eight Holstein calves by normothermic ischemia during cardiopulmonary bypass. A Pierce-Donachy left VAD (LVAD) was used for left ventricular support following the ischemic insult. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained throughout the study, and each animal served as its own control. A significant increase in post injury cardiac output (33.5 +/- 11.4%) was obtained with use of the Uniport and LVAD, as compared to use of the LVAD alone (p less than or equal to 0.005). Other hemodynamic parameters of right heart failure, including right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and left atrial pressure (LAP) were not significantly affected. These data suggest that the Uniport right ventricular assist device significantly improves cardiac output in this model of moderate right ventricular failure. Additional studies are required, however, to optimize pump stroke volume, and to further define the performance envelope of the device.","['Animals', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cattle', 'Equipment Design', 'Heart Failure', 'Heart-Assist Devices', 'Hemodynamics', 'Male', 'Ventricular Function, Right']",2252737,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.370.380.150', 'G09.330.380.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['E05.320'], ['C14.280.434'], ['E04.050.430', 'E07.695.300.300', 'E07.858.082.374.300'], ['G09.330.380'], ['G09.330.955.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
32373,Excess Hispanic fetal-infant mortality in a midwestern community.,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed excess fetal-infant mortality for Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black populations in five contiguous counties of Missouri and Kansas.METHODS: We conducted a perinatal periods of risk (PPOR) assessment of fetal-infant mortality using electronic linked birth-death record files from 2001 through 2005. We generated an internal reference group in accordance with established PPOR protocol. We used Kitagawa analysis to determine whether excess deaths were due to birthweight distribution (a higher frequency of prematurity or growth retardation) or to higher mortality rates once born at that birthweight (birthweight-specific mortality).RESULTS: We found the excess fetal-infant death rates for Hispanic and non-Hispanic white populations to be similar and considerably lower than that for non-Hispanic black populations. Among Hispanic children, we judged 21.6% of fetal-infant mortality to be excess in relation to the reference population. Within the PPOR matrix, Hispanic excess mortality rates were distributed differently from those of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black populations. Among Hispanic children, 93.6% of the excess mortality could be explained by low birthweight and birthweight-specific mortality, with the greatest contribution attributable to low birthweight.CONCLUSION: The excess fetal-infant mortality experience of Hispanic people in the five-county region was similar to that of the non-Hispanic white population, but was distributed differently in the PPOR model, which has significance regarding interventions targeting reductions in fetal-infant mortality.","['African Americans', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', 'Fetal Mortality', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infant, Low Birth Weight', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Kansas', 'Maternal Welfare', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Missouri', 'Perinatal Care', 'Pregnancy']",19753949,"[['M01.686.508.100.100', 'M01.686.754.100'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.362', 'N01.224.935.698.300', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.362', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.362'], ['M01.686.754.441'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.475', 'N01.224.935.698.489', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.475', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.475'], ['M01.060.703.520.460'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.703.520.520'], ['Z01.107.567.875.510.390'], ['I01.880.787.678'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.500', 'N04.452.859.564.550', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.500', 'N06.850.520.308.940.968.500'], ['Z01.107.567.875.510.515'], ['E02.760.703', 'N02.421.088.120.180', 'N02.421.143.620.550', 'N02.421.585.703'], ['G08.686.784.769']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

41247,BHRF1 exerts an antiapoptotic effect and cell cycle arrest via Bcl-2 in murine hybridomas.,"Apoptosis has been widely studied in order to find methods to increase the life-span and production performance in large-scale animal cell cultures. The use of anti-apoptotic genes has emerged as an efficient method to reduce apoptosis in a variety of biotechnological relevant cell lines, including CHO and hybridomas, alternatively to small molecule inhibitors. It is already known that expression of BHRF1, an Epstein-Barr virus-encoded early protein homologous to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, protects hybridoma cells from apoptosis in batch and continuous operation modes resulting in a delay in the cell death process under glutamine starvation conditions. In the present study, the mechanism of action of BHRF1 was investigated in a murine hybridoma cell line. BHRF1 protein was found in the mitochondrial cell fraction both under normal growing conditions and apoptosis-inducing conditions. Remarkably, the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl2 in BHRF1-expressing cells was up-regulated 25-fold compared to mock-transfected controls under apoptosis triggering conditions and its expression correlated with survival of transgenic cultures and cell cycle arrest in G1. Bcl-2 activity was revealed to be crucial for the BHRF1-mediated effect since the addition of specific inhibitors of Bcl-2 (namely HA14-1 and YC-137) resulted in a loss of function of BHRF1-expressing cells under glutamine starvation conditions. Moreover, the interaction of BHRF1 with the pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bim conferred mitochondrial stability to BHRF1 expressing cells under apoptosis-triggering conditions.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Batch Cell Culture Techniques', 'Benzopyrans', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line', 'Hybridomas', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria', 'Nitriles', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Thiazoles', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral Proteins']",26057602,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['E05.481.500.249.124'], ['D03.383.663.283', 'D03.633.100.150'], ['G04.144.109'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A11.251.353.485', 'A11.251.600.485'], ['G03.295.770.500', 'G04.580.550', 'G07.265.675.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['D02.626'], ['D12.644.360.075.718', 'D12.776.476.075.718', 'D12.776.624.664.700.169'], ['D02.886.675', 'D03.383.129.708'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['G02.111.905', 'G05.308.850', 'G07.690.773.998'], ['D12.776.964']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
22419,Thymus-independent expression of a truncated T cell receptor-alpha mRNA in murine kidney.,"During studies on gene expression in the kidney, we unexpectedly observed that murine kidney expresses a truncated form of TCR-alpha mRNA (1.3-1.4 kb). This transcript was not associated with the presence of complete TCR-alpha mRNA (1.7 kb) or detectable TCR-beta or -delta transcripts, thus indicating that the truncated TCR-alpha mRNA could not be attributed to blood contamination of the kidney RNA preparation. The truncated TCR-alpha message appeared to contain at least the C alpha region, as suggested by hybridization with an intra-C alpha 24 oligonucleotide probe, by amplification of the C alpha region with the polymerase chain reaction from total kidney mRNA, and by sequencing of, and hybridization with, the amplified products. In situ hybridization of kidney sections indicated that the transcript was expressed in interstitial cells. Northern blots of cortex and medulla RNA showed that the cells expressing the truncated TCR-alpha mRNA were predominantly located in the medulla. To investigate the possibility that the transcript was not produced by T cells or NK cells, fractionation of renal cell suspensions were performed. The truncated TCR-alpha mRNA was detected in a fraction containing large (low buoyant density) cells in which no expression of CD3, Thy 1, or NK-1.1 was detected, indicating that these cells are not mature T cells, do not express a functional TCR, and are not NK cells. The cells expressing the truncated TCR-alpha mRNA were radiosensitive, and were not thymus dependent, because this transcript was as abundant in nude mice as in normal mice. The transcript was not detected in bone marrow. Expression of the truncated TCR-alpha mRNA was not dependent on an intact recombinase activity as its expression was not affected by the severe combined immunodeficiency mutation. Our results show that murine kidney contains a population of radiosensitive thymus-independent large interstitial cells that express a truncated TCR-alpha mRNA that is not associated with surface expression of functional TCR. These cells may have attempted to rearrange TCR-alpha genes, suggesting that they may be related to the lymphoid lineage.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases', 'Female', 'Integrases', 'Kidney', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', 'Recombinases', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thymus Gland', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1530865,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.095', 'E05.301.300.074', 'E05.601.100'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.308'], ['D08.811.739.500'], ['A05.810.453'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.537', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.537', 'A15.382.490.555.567.537'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.440', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.440'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.816.824.825'], ['D08.811.739'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569'], ['A10.549.750', 'A15.382.520.604.750'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

32082,Expression and functional activity of isotype and subclass switched human monoclonal antibody reactive with the base of the V3 loop of HIV-1 gp120.,"Immunoglobulins undergo isotype switching in response to antigenic stimulation. The C(H) domains, in particular the hinge region, impose structural constraints on the interaction of antibody with antigen, especially multivalent antigens such as HIV. We previously showed that switching the IgG1 anti-HIV human monoclonal antibody (HMAb) F105 to an IgG3 resulted in significantly enhanced neutralization of HIV. To further investigate the influence of isotype, including the functional activity of HMAbs switched to IgA, which may be important in mucosal defenses, isotype switched antibodies have been generated for the anti-V3 loop base IgG2 HMAb F425B4e8. Reactivity of the IgG1 antibody was greater than the parental IgG2 antibody for SF2 infected cells but less for primary isolate virions. In contrast, there was less reactivity of the IgG3 with either infected cells or virions. IgA reacted significantly more with infected cells and virions as compared to the IgG subclasses. In contrast to previous studies whereby IgG3 enhanced neutralization, comparable neutralization of primary isolate virus was observed for IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3) and IgA. This may reflect differences in the exposure of epitopes recognized by the HMAb with antibody flexibility being important to neutralization by antibodies reactive with obscured epitopes (e.g., CD4 binding site). Further analysis of the in vitro activity of isotype or subclass switched antibodies, IgA in particular, alone and in combination with other HMAbs, will provide important information on the role of IgG subclass and IgA antibodies on protective immunity to HIV.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Epitopes', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'HIV Antibodies', 'HIV Antigens', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virion']",12908937,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['G12.100'], ['G12.122'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D23.050.550'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.335', 'G12.500.299'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254.150.440', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254.150.440', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254.150.440'], ['D23.050.327.520'], ['D12.776.964.775.325.164.249', 'D12.776.964.775.562.500.500', 'D12.776.964.970.880.325.164.249', 'D23.050.327.520.350'], ['B04.820.650.589.650.350.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.251.353.485', 'A11.251.600.485'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.026', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.026', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.026'], ['G05.344.401.501.450', 'G12.500.274.501.450'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619'], ['D12.644.541.500.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.797', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650.500', 'D12.776.124.790.651.797', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650.500', 'D12.776.377.715.548.797', 'G02.111.570.060.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['C04.557.595.500', 'C14.907.454.460', 'C15.378.147.780.650', 'C15.378.463.515.460', 'C20.683.515.845', 'C20.683.780.650'], ['E05.393.420.601.575'], ['E01.370.225.812.735.550', 'E05.200.812.735.550', 'E05.478.594.760.550'], ['D12.644.541'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['E05.393.751'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['A11.251.860'], ['A21.249']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
28706,Application of denaturing gradient gel blots to detect p53 mutations in X-ray-transformed mouse C3H 10T1/2 clones.,"The denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) blot technique is a highly sensitive method developed to detect sequence differences (e.g., single base changes and small deletions) in genomic DNA. We used this method to screen for mutations within the p53 locus of independent X-ray-transformed C3H 10T1/2 cell clones. Genomic DNA from 29 transformed clones was digested with Haell and Hinfl endonucleases, electrophoresed on denaturing gradient gels, electroblotted onto nylon membranes, and hybridized to a radioactive p53 cDNA probe. Changes in the melting pattern of p53 were observed in DNAs from 9 of 29 X-ray-transformed clones examined. No changes were found in untransformed, wild-type 10T1/2 cell clones. These results indicate that X-ray-induced p53 mutations may contribute to cell transformation.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Exons', 'Genes, p53', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'X-Rays']",8489714,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210'], ['C04.697.098.500', 'C23.550.727.098.500'], ['E05.196.401.153', 'E05.301.300.100'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.137.232'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.249.385', 'G05.360.340.024.340.415.400.385'], ['E05.481'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['G05.365.590'], ['E05.393.640', 'G02.111.603', 'G05.627'], ['G05.365.795'], ['G01.358.500.505.970', 'G01.750.250.970', 'G01.750.750.918']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5798,Public health physicians: an endangered species.,"BACKGROUND: Questions have arisen regarding the competency levels of the various professions within the public health sector, including those of physicians. Protection of the nation's health requires that physicians on the public health team be competent practitioners of both medicine and public health. Physicians practicing in this arena are required to possess a vast array of knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be effective contributors in the field.METHODS: Using focus groups of key informants in public health, the context of practice, inventory of required competencies, current competencies, and identified gaps in these competencies, measures to address the situation were identified and discussed.RESULTS: Recommendations from the focus groups include: use of distance-based learning, development of educational materials and programs, use of the American College of Preventive Medicine as a facilitator, improved remuneration, changes to the certification process, utilization of mentoring programs, introduction of new marketing strategies, use of professional publications, and increased governmental/agency support. Contributors to this endeavor are identified.CONCLUSIONS: While we strive to improve the physician workforce entering the field, creative strategies for continued lifelong learning are urgently needed to facilitate ongoing development of physicians in the current public health workforce. This situation presents a major research agenda for public health practice. Identification of the essential knowledge, skills, and attitudes for public health physicians is the first step toward narrowing gaps in required competencies.","['Clinical Competence', 'Competency-Based Education', 'Employment', 'Humans', 'Public Health']",11567846,"[['I02.399.630.210', 'N04.761.210', 'N05.715.175'], ['I02.158.210'], ['N01.824.245'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H02.403.720', 'N01.400.550', 'N06.850']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
36981,Adherence to bisphosphonate therapy and fracture rates in osteoporotic women: relationship to vertebral and nonvertebral fractures from 2 US claims databases.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the relationships between adherence (complance and persistence) to bisphosphonate therapy and risk of specific fracture types in postmenopausal women.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected from 45 employers and 100 health plans in the continental United States from 2 claims databases during a 5-year period (January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2003). Claims from patients receiving a bisphosphonate prescription (alendronate or risedronate) were evaluated for 6 months before the Index prescription and during 24 months of follow-up to determine total, vertebral, and nonvertebral osteoporotic fractures, persistence (no gap in refills for >30 days during 24 months), and refill compliance (medication possession ratio > or = 0.80).RESULTS: The eligible cohort included 35,537 women (age, > or = 45 years) who received a bisphosphonate prescription. A subgroup with a specified diagnosis of postmenopausal osteoporosis was also evaluated. Forty-three percent were refill compliant, and 20% persisted with bisphosphonate therapy during the 24-month study period. Total, vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures were significantly lower in refill-compliant and persistent patients, with relative risk reductions of 20% to 45%. The relationship between adherence and fracture risk remained significant after adjustment for baseline age, concomitant medications, and fracture history. There was a progressive relationship between refill compliance and fracture risk reduction, commencing at refill compliance rates of approximately 50% and becoming more pronounced at compliance rates of 75% and higher.CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to bisphosphonate therapy was associated with significantly fewer fractures at 24 months. Increasing refill compliance levels were associated with progressively lower fracture rates. These findings suggest that incremental changes in medication-taking habits could improve clinical outcomes of osteoporosis treatment.","['Aged', 'Diphosphonates', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hip Fractures', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal', 'Patient Compliance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Spinal Fractures', 'Wrist Injuries']",16901023,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D02.705.429.500'], ['E02.319.307', 'N02.421.668.778.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C26.404.061.425', 'C26.531.750', 'C26.558.276.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['N03.219.521.576.215'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05.116.198.579.610', 'C18.452.104.579.610'], ['F01.100.150.750.500.600', 'F01.145.488.887.500.600', 'N05.300.150.800.500.600'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C26.117.500.500', 'C26.404.812'], ['C26.088.906']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
42435,Prognostic role of neurophysiological testing 3-7 days after onset of acute unilateral Bell's palsy.,"OBJECTIVE: Recovery from acute Bell's palsy (BP) is variable and there are few predictors of response. We evaluated the usefulness of a range of neurophysiological parameters to predict outcome in BP.METHODS: Fifty-nine patients (age: 33.7±15.4 years) with acute unilateral BP were recruited within 3-7 days of onset. They were evaluated with electroneurography, facial nerve excitability, and the blink reflex. House-Brackmann (HB) clinical scores were obtained at the same time and three months later. All patients received prednisolone treatment and regular rehabilitation.RESULTS: At three months, 41 patients (69.5%) had good recovery, while 18 patients (30.5%) had poor recovery according to the HB scale. The facial nerve excitability threshold and threshold difference between sides were significantly lower in patients with good recovery than those with poor recovery (P values=0.022 and 0.006 respectively). Facial nerve degeneration rate (1 - affected/unaffected amplitude of CMAP of muscle ?100%) recorded in frontalis (P=0.002) and orbicularis oris (P=0.038) were also smaller in good recovery than poor recovery patients. There were no differences in latency and amplitude of CMAPs recorded from frontalis or orbicularis oris muscle, nor in latencies of the components of the blink reflex. ROC analysis showed that patients who had a threshold side difference <13mA (35 cases), had a higher chance of good recovery (85.7% versus 14.3% poor recovery). Patients who had a degeneration rate<50% (38 cases) also had a higher chance of good recovery (78.9%) versus 21.1% who had poor recovery, while patients with a degeneration rate>50% (21 cases) had a 47.8% chance of good recovery versus 52.2% poor recovery (P=0.004). Logistic regression analysis showed that the most significant predictive indicator of BP recovery was the facial nerve degeneration rate of frontalis muscle (P=0.011).CONCLUSION: Facial nerve degeneration rate of frontalis muscle provides the most sensitive prognostic indicator of recovery from acute BP and may provide useful management strategies.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bell Palsy', 'Blinking', 'Electromyography', 'Facial Muscles', 'Facial Nerve', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Prognosis', 'Recovery of Function', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",29496378,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C01.925.256.466.087', 'C07.465.094', 'C07.465.299.250', 'C10.292.319.250'], ['G11.561.731.127', 'G14.152'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['A02.633.567.400', 'A14.363'], ['A08.800.050.050.275', 'A08.800.050.600.149', 'A08.800.800.060.275', 'A08.800.800.120.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.737'], ['E01.789'], ['G16.757'], ['G01.910.857'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
4777,The frame turns also: factors in differential rotation in pictures.,"When pictures of simple shapes (square, diamond) were seen frontally and obliquely, (1) the shapes with a deeper extent into pictured space underwent more rotation (Goldstein, 1979), which is an apparent turning to keep an orientation toward an observer's changing position; (2) there was little effect of whether the observer knew the picture surface's orientation in real space, except that such knowledge could prevent multistability; and (3) depicted picture frames also rotated. In other experiments, figural and frame rotations were independent of each other, and rotation was shown for real frames. The rotation of depthless depictions suggests that at least two rotational factors exist, one that involves the object's virtual depth and one that does not. The nature of this second factor is discussed. Frame rotation appeared to subtract from object rotation when the two were being compared; this could explain a paradox in picture perception: Depicted orientations often seem little changed over viewpoints, despite (apparent) rotations with respect to real-space coordinates.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attention', 'Depth Perception', 'Discrimination Learning', 'Female', 'Field Dependence-Independence', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Optical Illusions', 'Orientation', 'Pattern Recognition, Visual']",8255712,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['F02.830.104.214'], ['F02.463.593.200', 'F02.463.593.778.255'], ['F02.463.425.280'], ['F02.463.593.343'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F02.463.593.446.659'], ['F01.058.577', 'F02.830.606'], ['F02.463.593.524.500', 'F02.463.593.932.622']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
37038,Radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer: local tumor extension and prognosis.,"BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the frequency of local tumor extension and its effect on disease progression after radical prostatectomy.METHODS: The study consisted of 66 consecutive men who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer without any prior hormonal therapy. Cases were stratified according to pathologic findings. Sites of capsular penetration were also evaluated.RESULTS: The overall incidences of lymph node metastases, seminal vesicle invasion, capsular penetration, and positive surgical margin were, respectively, 23%, 32%, 55% and 35%. The disease progression rate in patients with positive lymph nodes differed significantly from that in those without nodal metastases (P < 0.0001). Although seminal vesicle invasion, capsular penetration, or positive surgical margin had an adverse effect on prognosis, the difference in progression missed statistical significance, when patients with positive lymph node metastases were excluded. The most common site of capsular penetration was posterolateral, in the area of the neurovascular bundle.CONCLUSIONS: Extraglandular tumor extension and positive surgical margins are common features of radical prostatectomy specimens. A nerve-sparing operation should be performed selectively and with great caution. The markedly adverse effect of lymph node involvement on progression must be accounted for when evaluating other variables relating to progression.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Retrospective Studies']",8886914,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789'], ['E04.950.774.860.625'], ['C04.588.945.440.770', 'C12.294.260.750', 'C12.294.565.625', 'C12.758.409.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
174,Characterization of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BetB) as an essential virulence factor of Brucella abortus.,"The pathogenic mechanisms of Brucellosis used to adapt to the harsh intracellular environment of the host cell are not fully understood. The present study investigated the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of B. abortus betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BetB) (Gene Bank ID: 006932) using a betB deletion mutant constructed from virulent B. abortus 544. In test under stress conditions, including osmotic- and acid stress-resistance, the betB mutant had a lower osmotic-resistance than B. abortus wild-type. In addition, the betB mutant showed higher internalization rates compared to the wild-type strain; however, it also displayed replication failures in HeLa cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. During internalization, compared to the wild-type strain, the betB mutant was more adherent to the host surface and showed enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinases, two processes that promote phagocytic activity, in host cells. During intracellular trafficking, colocalization of B. abortus-containing phagosomes with LAMP-1 was elevated in betB mutant-infected cells compared to the wild-type cells. In mice, the betB mutant was predominantly cleared from spleens compared to the wild-type strain after 2 weeks post-infection, and the vaccination test with the live betB mutant showed effective protection against challenge infection with the virulent wild-type strain. These findings suggested that the B. abortus betB gene substantially affects the phagocytic pathway in human phagocytes and in host cells in mice. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential use of the B. abortus betB mutant as a live vaccine for the control of brucellosis.","['Animals', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Bacterial Vaccines', 'Betaine-Aldehyde Dehydrogenase', 'Brucella abortus', 'Brucellosis', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Phagocytes', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Spleen', 'Virulence Factors']",24210811,"[['B01.050'], ['G06.099.050'], ['D20.215.894.135'], ['D08.811.682.657.163.515'], ['B03.440.400.425.215.500.100', 'B03.660.050.070.100.100'], ['C01.150.252.400.167'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['G01.374.715.578', 'G02.640.249', 'G02.723.661'], ['A11.733', 'A15.382.680'], ['G05.365.590.762', 'G05.558.800'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700'], ['D23.946.896']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
37327,"A novel hypothesis concerning the mechanisms of activation, and of control, of periodontal bone loss.","Chronic inflammatory periodontitis fulfills the classical definition of an infectious disease in that it is a disease of the host caused by the activities of one or more parasites. Typically, the etiology of an infectious disease has been defined as the specific microbe which incites the disease process, even though the quality and nature of host responses to the pathogen may underlie much of the pathology seen. This approach in the study of the etiology of chronic periodontitis has not resulted in the identification of a single 'periodontopathogen', but rather is leading to the realization that multiple sets of microbes may induce the same endpoint, albeit some possibly more efficiently than others. The premise of this paper is that a different view of the literature in the area, with the primary emphasis on the mechanisms of damage and resistance to periodontitis, reveals a probable commonality, rather than a plethora of diseases. The concept of a mechanism-based etiology, rather than of a microbe-based one, deserves consideration for this complex, host-parasite interaction. The novel hypothesis presented here is that the common virulence factor of chronic periodontitis is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), that the central damaging mediator is a cyclooxygenase product of arachidonic acid (probably prostaglandin E2), and that the critical resistance mechanism that limits disease activity is the effective, peripheral neutralization of LPS by emigrated polymorphonuclear neutrophils.","['Alveolar Bone Loss', 'Dinoprostone', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Models, Biological', 'Neutrophils', 'Periodontitis']",1890968,"[['C05.116.264.150', 'C07.465.714.354.500'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['C07.465.714.533']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral gluteal fascio-myo-cutaneous advancement flap (BGFMCF) in treatment of recurrent PND.PATIENT AND METHODS: Forty patients (35 males, 5 females) with recurrent PND were admitted and treated with BGFMCF. Variables assessed were incidence of recurrence, postoperative complications, patients' satisfaction and quality of life.RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 25 ± 6.8 years and a mean body mass index of 28.4 ± 2.7. Mean operative time was 87 ± 13 min and mean length of hospital stay was 3 ± 0.7 days. Mean period of follow-up was 15.8 ± 4.9 months. Recurrence was detected in 2 (5%) patients and minor complications occurred in 6 (15%) patients. Thirty eight (95%) patients were satisfied by the procedure at the end of follow-up period.CONCLUSION: BGFMCF is an effective procedure for treatment of recurrent sacrococcygeal PND with low recurrence rate and acceptable morbidity.","['Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Buttocks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Operative Time', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Photography', 'Pilonidal Sinus', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Sacrococcygeal Region', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",26975846,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['A01.378.610.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E04.614.374.500', 'N02.421.585.753.374.500'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['E01.370.350.600', 'E05.712'], ['C04.182.710'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E04.680'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['A01.923.176.780'], ['A10.850.710', 'E07.862.710'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
30336,Children with specific reading retardation--early determinants and long-term outcome.,"In a prospective epidemiological longitudinal study of children (n = 399) from age 8 to 18 years, children with specific reading retardation (n = 37) were identified by the modified Research Diagnostic Criteria of ICD-10. The group with specific reading retardation was compared with a group with other specific developmental disorders (n = 62), a group of children with normal intelligence (n = 285) and a group of children with below average intelligence (n = 15). No correlation was found between reading retardation and pre- and perinatal complications. Children with reading retardation suffered from environment-related stress factors in early childhood and adverse familial conditions at 8 years and the educational level of the mother was significantly lower. The number of additional psychiatric symptoms was increased at ages 8, 13 and 18. Conduct disorders, in particular, were more frequent in children with specific reading retardation and the rate of juvenile delinquency was increased (25%). The non-verbal intelligence remained constant between ages 8 and 13, and spelling performance developed parallel to the control group with normal intelligence. Only one out of three showed a significant improvement in spelling ability.","['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Disorders', 'Comorbidity', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Dyslexia', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mental Disorders', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Writing']",7521559,"[['M01.060.057'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F03.625.141'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['F03.625.421'], ['C10.597.606.150.500.300', 'C10.597.606.150.550.200', 'C23.888.592.604.150.500.300', 'C23.888.592.604.150.550.200', 'F03.625.562.400'], ['Z01.542.315'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['F03'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['L01.559.423.906']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
38367,"Pre-diagnostic smoking behaviour and poorer prognosis in a German breast cancer patient cohort - Differential effects by tumour subtype, NAT2 status, BMI and alcohol intake.","BACKGROUND: Inconsistent associations of smoking and breast cancer-specific mortality might be explained by subgroups of patients with different susceptibility to harmful effects of smoking.METHODS: We used a prospective cohort of 3340 postmenopausal breast cancer patients aged 50-74 and diagnosed with invasive tumours 2001-2005 in Germany, with a median follow-up time of 6 years. The effect of pre-diagnostic smoking behaviour on mortality outcomes and risk of recurrence was investigated using delayed entry Cox regression analysis. Differential effects according to N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) status, BMI, alcohol consumption, and tumour subtypes were assessed.RESULTS: Overall, smoking at time of breast cancer diagnosis versus never/former smoking was non-significantly associated with increased breast cancer-specific mortality and risk of recurrence (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.93-1.64, and HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.95-1.75, respectively). Associations were consistently stronger in NAT2 slow than in fast acetylators for all mortality outcomes. Breast cancer-specific mortality was significantly increased in smokers with NAT2 slow acetylating status (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.13-2.79) but not in those with fast acetylating status (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.60-1.98; Pheterogeneity=0.19). Smoking was associated with significantly poorer outcomes for triple negative and luminal A-like tumours (e.g. all-cause mortality: HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.02-3.65, and HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.40-3.10, respectively). Risk of recurrence was significantly increased for women with HER2 positive tumours (HR 3.64, 95% CI 1.22-10.8). There was significant heterogeneity by BMI for non-breast cancer-specific mortality (<25 kg/m(2): HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.52-4.15 vs. ?25 kg/m(2): HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.38-2.36; Pheterogeneity=0.04).CONCLUSION: The harmful effects of smoking may be particularly relevant for certain subgroups of breast cancer patients. This may include patients with NAT2 slow acetylation status or with tumour subtypes other than luminal B, such as luminal A tumours who usually have a rather good prognosis. Emphasis on smoking cessation programmes for all cancer patients should be strengthened.","['Aged', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase', 'Body Mass Index', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cohort Studies', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking']",24950597,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['F01.145.317.269'], ['D08.811.913.050.134.138'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['G05.380'], ['Z01.542.315'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.805']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Ethnopharmacologists, botanists, microbiologists and natural-products scientists are combing the earth for phytochemicals and leads, which could be developed for treatment of infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the antifungal activities of the essential oils of some medicinal plants such as Stachys pubescens, Thymus kotschyanus, Thymus daenensis and Bupleurum falcatum against Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus flavus and Alternaria alternata. The essential oils were used to evaluate their MICs and MFCs compared to the amphotricin B as a standard drug. The essential oils were also analyzed by GC/MS. Essential oils isolated from the S. pubescens, T. kotschyanus and B. falcatum showed strong antifungal activities. The essential oil of T. daenensis exhibited a moderate activity against the selected fungi in comparison with the other plants' essential oils. In addition, the results showed that 26, 23, 22 and 15 components were identified from the essential oils of T. kotschyanus, S. pubescens, T. daenensis and B. falcatum, respectively. These oils exhibited a noticeable antifungal activity against the selected fungi. Regarding obtained results and that natural antimicrobial substances are inexpensive and have fewer side effects, they convey potential for implementation in fungal pathogenic systems.","['Antifungal Agents', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'Bupleurum', 'Fusarium', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Plant Oils', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Stachys', 'Thymus Plant']",24768063,"[['D27.505.954.122.136'], ['B01.300.381.081.170'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.075.144'], ['B01.300.381.366'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['D10.627.675'], ['D10.627.700', 'D20.215.784.750'], ['B01.650.560'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.583.520.947'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.583.520.974']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
40294,Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. I. Aldosterone-induced domes and their evaluation as a model system.,"Vectorial transport of salt and water in the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line is indicated by the formation of domes when a monolayer is grown on an impermeable support. We investigated aldosterone-induced dome formation and evaluated the dome as an experimental model. Transepithelial dome resistance was about 80 omega cm2 and constant when dome size exceeded 2.10(-4) cm2. The relative ion conductances (expressed as transference numbers) across the dome epithelium were tNa:tCl:tk = 0.64:0.24:0.06. They reflect the permeability properties of the paracellular shunt pathway tested at physiological concentrations of the individual ions. Aldosterone accelerated dome formation in serum-deprived MDCK monolayers. Prostaglandin E1 and transferrin were supportive but not essential for aldosterone-induced dome formation. After 72 h dome density was equal in monolayers cultured in serum-supplemented medium either in the presence or absence of mineralocorticoids. We conclude that aldosterone induces cell polarization in MDCK monolayers, leading to the formation of domes. The dome epithelium appears to be electrically isolated from the adjacent monolayer and can be studied by microelectrode techniques.","['Aldosterone', 'Alprostadil', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Blood', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorides', 'Dogs', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Epithelium', 'Kidney', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Models, Biological', 'Potassium', 'Sodium', 'Transferrin']",2235294,"[['D04.210.500.745.745.654.062', 'D06.472.040.585.353.118'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.100', 'D10.251.355.325.050', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.100'], ['B01.050'], ['G03.143.310'], ['A12.207.152', 'A15.145'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D01.210.450.150', 'D01.248.497.158.215'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G01.358.500.249.277'], ['A10.272'], ['A05.810.453'], ['G01.154.535', 'G04.580', 'G07.265.675', 'G11.561.570'], ['E05.599.395'], ['D01.268.549.550', 'D01.268.557.575', 'D01.552.528.652', 'D01.552.547.650'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['D12.776.124.050.800', 'D12.776.124.790.223.839', 'D12.776.157.427.750.500', 'D12.776.377.715.182.839', 'D12.776.556.579.750.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The AVP plasma levels in normal subjects were 3.1 +/- 1.2 pg/ml. The parallel changes in plasma osmolality, plasma AVP concentration, and urinary osmolality were observed after water load. In patients with various kinds of hyponatremia and impaired water excretion, plasma AVP concentrations were within or over normal levels, suggesting that persistent secretion of AVP may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hyponatremia. Variable levels of plasma AVP were observed in patients with essential hypernatremia, which in turn suggested that osmoreceptors may be selectively damaged in some patients, and that ADH-secreting neurons are also involved in others.

49157,"Second cancer incidence, risk factor, and specific mortality in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","OBJECTIVE: Second primary malignancies (SPMs) are common in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and have a negative impact on their survival. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors for SPM occurrence and cause-specific mortality in Asian HNSCC patients.STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.SETTING: University teaching hospital.SUBJECTS: Nine hundred and thirty-seven patients without previous cancer history who were treated between 2000 and 2009 and followed for at least 2 years.METHODS: Confirmation of SPMs was performed by histopathology. The cumulative probability of a SPM among survivors of index HNSCC was calculated using a competing risk model. Univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to determine factors predictive of SPM occurrence and cause-specific mortality.RESULTS: Of 937 patients, cumulative incidence of SPMs was 7.2% at 0 to 6 months (synchronous), 17.9% at 5 years, and 23.1% at 10 years after index tumor diagnosis. In multivariate analyses, old age (>60 years) (P = .002), hypopharyngeal index tumor site (P = .001), and heavy drinker (P = .001) were independently associated with the development of SPMs, and hypopharyngeal index tumor site were independent variables for SPM-specific survival (P < .001). Cumulative incidence function of SPM-specific mortality according to index tumor sites was significantly higher in the hypopharynx than other sites (P = .011).CONCLUSION: Elderly patients, hypopharyngeal index cancer patients, or heavy drinkers may require careful surveillance for the development of SPMs. Our results may help identify and properly manage Asian patients at high risk of SPMs.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck', 'Young Adult']",23820107,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['F01.145.317.269'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['C04.588.274.476', 'C06.301.371', 'C06.405.249'], ['C04.588.443'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.443.665.710.485', 'C07.550.745.436', 'C09.647.710.485', 'C09.775.549.485'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['C04.651'], ['C04.692'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.805'], ['C04.557.470.200.400.565', 'C04.588.443.177'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
20307,Defining the boundaries and characterizing the landscape of functional genome expression in vascular tissues of Populus using shotgun proteomics.,"Current state-of-the-art experimental and computational proteomic approaches were integrated to obtain a comprehensive protein profile of Populus vascular tissue. This featured: (1) a large sample set consisting of two genotypes grown under normal and tension stress conditions, (2) bioinformatics clustering to effectively handle gene duplication, and (3) an informatics approach to track and identify single amino acid polymorphisms (SAAPs). By applying a clustering algorithm to the Populus database, the number of protein entries decreased from 64,689 proteins to a total of 43,069 protein groups, thereby reducing 7505 identified proteins to a total of 4226 protein groups, in which 2016 were singletons. This reduction implies that ?50% of the measured proteins shared extensive sequence homology. Using conservative search criteria, we were able to identify 1354 peptides containing a SAAP and 201 peptides that become tryptic due to a K or R substitution. These newly identified peptides correspond to 502 proteins, including 97 previously unidentified proteins. In total, the integration of deep proteome measurements on an extensive sample set with protein clustering and peptide sequence variants provided an exceptional level of proteome characterization for Populus, allowing us to spatially resolve the vascular tissue proteome.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Wall', 'Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genome, Plant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Vascular Bundle', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Populus', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",22003893,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['A11.284.183'], ['H01.158.273.180', 'L01.313.124'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.308.375'], ['G05.360.340.365'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.644.541'], ['E05.196.181.400.454.720', 'E05.196.401.319.720', 'E05.196.700', 'E05.393.760.705.685'], ['D12.776.765'], ['A18.450'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.797.875.453'], ['G02.111.720', 'G03.812'], ['D12.776.817'], ['H01.158.201.843', 'H01.158.273.180.350.700', 'H01.158.273.343.350.700', 'H01.181.122.738'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['G07.775'], ['E05.196.566.880']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The method is based on a collision technique combined with a correlation analysis of the compound muscle potential. Using this procedure, the recovery in excitability and conduction velocity succeeding the absolute refractory period was measured in 13 normal subjects. In all subjects a period of subnormal conduction followed by a period of supernormal conduction was observed. The first fibres recovered at a mean of 0.75 +/- 0.07 msec; the last fibres recovered 1.3 +/- 0.3 msec. The period of subnormal conduction for a 100 mm conditioned conduction path length had a mean of 1.87 msec.

24031,Novel phosphorylation sites in the S. cerevisiae Cdc13 protein reveal new targets for telomere length regulation.,"The S. cerevisiae Cdc13 is a multifunctional protein with key roles in regulation of telomerase, telomere end protection, and conventional telomere replication, all of which are cell cycle-regulated processes. Given that phosphorylation is a key mechanism for regulating protein function, we identified sites of phosphorylation using nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). We also determined phosphorylation abundance on both wild type (WT) and a telomerase deficient form of Cdc13, encoded by the cdc13-2 allele, in both G1 phase cells, when telomerase is not active, and G2/M phase cells, when it is. We identified 21 sites of in vivo phosphorylation, of which only five had been reported previously. In contrast, phosphorylation of two in vitro targets of the ATM-like Tel1 kinase, S249 and S255, was not detected. This result helps resolve conflicting data on the importance of phosphorylation of these residues in telomerase recruitment. Multiple residues showed differences in their cell cycle pattern of modification. For example, phosphorylation of S314 was significantly higher in the G2/M compared to the G1 phase and in WT versus mutant Cdc13, and a S314D mutation negatively affected telomere length. Our findings provide new targets in a key telomerase regulatory protein for modulation of telomere dynamics.","['Cell Cycle', 'DNA Replication', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere', 'Telomere Homeostasis', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins']",23181431,"[['G04.144'], ['G02.111.225', 'G05.226'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['B01.300.107.795.785.800', 'B01.300.930.705.655'], ['D12.776.354.750'], ['E05.196.566.880'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.308.300.750.750', 'D12.776.157.687.613', 'D12.776.157.725.500.921', 'D12.776.660.720.613', 'D12.776.664.962.500.921'], ['A11.284.430.106.279.345.190.160.845', 'G05.360.160.845'], ['G04.144.220.625', 'G04.161.750.500.500', 'G05.113.610', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500.750'], ['D12.776.260.735', 'D12.776.660.235.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
49870,Recognition of a mycobacteria-specific epitope in the 65-kD heat-shock protein by synovial fluid-derived T cell clones.,"Adjuvant arthritis in rats is induced by a T cell clone specific for amino acids 180-188 of the mycobacterial 65-kD heat-shock protein, and synovial T cell responses to this same Ag have been noted in human arthritis. We have isolated 65-kD Ag-specific T cell clones from synovial fluid mononuclear cells of a patient with acute arthritis, which, unlike the corresponding PBMC, showed a marked proliferative response to the 65-kD Ag. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to the whole sequence of the 65-kD Ag, all the clones were shown to recognize an epitope present in the first NH2-terminal peptide (amino acids 1-15), with no response to the adjacent peptide (amino acids 6-22) or to any other peptide. The complete dominance of this epitope in the response to the 65-kD Ag was shown by documenting responses to the peptide in PBMC obtained after recovery from the arthritis. This epitope, like that recognized by the rat arthritogenic T cell clone, is in a portion of the 65-kD sequence that is not conserved between bacteria and eukaryotes, so that in this case, joint inflammation could not be attributed to bacteria-induced T cell clones cross-reacting with the self 65-kD Ag.","['Antigens, Bacterial', 'Clone Cells', 'Epitopes', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium', 'Synovial Fluid', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1689764,"[['D23.050.161'], ['A11.251.353'], ['D23.050.550'], ['D12.776.395.550.509.400.440', 'D12.776.543.550.440.400.440', 'D23.050.301.500.400.400.440', 'D23.050.301.500.450.400.440', 'D23.050.705.552.410.400.440', 'D23.050.705.552.450.400.440'], ['D12.776.580.216'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['B03.510.024.962.500', 'B03.510.460.400.410.552.552'], ['A02.835.583.443.800.800', 'A12.207.270.847'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
37122,Effects of population dispersal on regional signaling networks: An example from northern Iroquoia.,"The dispersal of Iroquoian groups from St. Lawrence River valley during the 15th and 16th centuries A.D. has been a source of archaeological inquiry for decades. Social network analysis presented here indicates that sites from Jefferson County, New York at the head of the St. Lawrence River controlled interactions within regional social signaling networks during the 15th century A.D. Measures indicate that Jefferson County sites were in brokerage liaison positions between sites in New York and Ontario. In the network for the subsequent century, to which no Jefferson County sites are assigned, no single group took the place of Jefferson County in controlling network flow. The dispersal of Jefferson County populations effectively ended this brokerage function concomitant with the emergence of the nascent Huron-Wendat and Iroquois confederacies and may have contributed to the escalation of conflict between these entities. These results add to a growing literature on the use of network analyses with archaeological data and contribute new insights into processes of population relocation and geopolitical realignment, as well as the role of borderlands and frontiers in nonstate societies.","['Archaeology', 'Geography', 'History, 15th Century', 'History, 16th Century', 'History, 17th Century', 'History, Medieval', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', 'New York', 'Ontario', 'Population Dynamics', 'Quebec', 'Social Networking']",28808682,"[['I01.076.201.208'], ['H01.277.500'], ['K01.400.475.500'], ['K01.400.475.750'], ['K01.400.504.750'], ['K01.400.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.599'], ['Z01.107.567.875.075.437', 'Z01.107.567.875.350.530', 'Z01.107.567.875.500.530'], ['Z01.107.567.176.639'], ['I01.240.600', 'N01.224.625', 'N06.850.505.400.700'], ['Z01.107.567.176.791'], ['L01.143.910']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1
9145,Impairment of RNA synthesis and its recovery in angelicin photosensitized mammalian cells. A probe for DNA damage and repair.,"The template activity of DNA for ribosomal RNA transcription has been investigated in monkey kidney CV-1 cells after angelicin photosensitization in order to monitor the induction of lesions in the DNA and their possible subsequent disappearance, i.e. repair. Separate confluent cultures were submitted to a single angelicin treatment at different time intervals before incubation with [3H]uridine. The labeled RNA prepared from whole cells was analysed by polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis. The results indicate that: Angelicin monoadditions on DNA constitute transcription-terminating lesions which depress overall RNA synthesis, give rise to shortened RNA chains and modify the expression of transcriptional linked genes. CV-1 cells are able to repair, at least partially, the induced transcription-terminating lesions and progressively recover RNA synthesis with a reversion of the initially observed modifications. The repair seems to be independent of semiconservative DNA synthesis since fluorodeoxyuridine does not affect the recovery of RNA transcription. The present work also confirms the arrangement of rRNA genes in tandem behind a common operator in the order 18--28 S as previously determined in the same cells by a radiological mapping technique and reinforces the potential applicability of transcription analysis to the study of repair processes operating on physically or chemically induced damage in DNA.","['Cell Line', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Furocoumarins', 'Kinetics', 'RNA', 'Ribosomes', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",718926,"[['A11.251.210'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G02.111.222', 'G05.219'], ['E05.799.513.500', 'G01.750.740.500', 'G04.712.500', 'G07.225', 'G07.738.500', 'N06.850.810.250.180'], ['D03.383.663.283.446.794', 'D03.633.100.150.446.794', 'D03.633.300.770'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D13.444.735'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.811'], ['G05.360.840'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
45714,Morbidity of repeat transsphenoidal surgery assessed in more than 1000 operations.,"UNLABELLED: OBJECT.: While transsphenoidal surgery is associated with low morbidity, the degree to which morbidity increases after reoperation remains unclear. The authors determined the morbidity associated with repeat versus initial transsphenoidal surgery after 1015 consecutive operations.METHODS: The authors conducted a 5-year retrospective review of the first 916 patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery at their institution after a pituitary center of expertise was established, and they analyzed morbidities.RESULTS: The authors analyzed 907 initial and 108 repeat transsphenoidal surgeries performed in 916 patients (9 initial surgeries performed outside the authors' center were excluded). The most common diagnoses were endocrine inactive (30%) or active (36%) adenomas, Rathke's cleft cysts (10%), and craniopharyngioma (3%). Morbidity of initial surgery versus reoperation included diabetes insipidus ([DI] 16% vs 26%; p = 0.03), postoperative hyponatremia (20% vs 16%; p = 0.3), new postoperative hypopituitarism (5% vs 8%; p = 0.3), CSF leak requiring repair (1% vs 4%; p = 0.04), meningitis (0.4% vs 3%; p = 0.02), and length of stay ([LOS] 2.8 vs 4.5 days; p = 0.006). Of intraoperative parameters and postoperative morbidities, 1) some (use of lumbar drain and new postoperative hypopituitarism) did not increase with second or subsequent reoperations (p = 0.3-0.9); 2) some (DI and meningitis) increased upon second surgery (p = 0.02-0.04) but did not continue to increase for subsequent reoperations (p = 0.3-0.9); 3) some (LOS) increased upon second surgery and increased again for subsequent reoperations (p < 0.001); and 4) some (postoperative hyponatremia and CSF leak requiring repair) did not increase upon second surgery (p = 0.3) but went on to increase upon subsequent reoperations (p = 0.001-0.02). Multivariate analysis revealed that operation number, but not sex, age, pathology, radiation therapy, or lesion size, increased the risk of CSF leak, meningitis, and increased LOS. Separate analysis of initial versus repeat transsphenoidal surgery on the 2 most common benign pituitary lesions, pituitary adenomas and Rathke's cleft cysts, revealed that the increased incidence of DI and CSF leak requiring repair seen when all pathologies were combined remained significant when analyzing only pituitary adenomas and Rathke's cleft cysts (DI, 13% vs 35% [p = 0.001]; and CSF leak, 0.3% vs 9% [p = 0.0009]).CONCLUSIONS: Repeat transsphenoidal surgery was associated with somewhat more frequent postoperative DI, meningitis, CSF leak requiring repair, and greater LOS than the low morbidity characterizing initial transsphenoidal surgery.

Although 40-60% of de novo fatty acid synthesis from [2-3H]acetate was inhibited by the administration of exogenous oleic or linoleic acid, sterole synthesis was only slightly affected. Within 24-48 h after incorporation, phospholipid fatty acyl groups could undergo active exchange between phospholipids. After this dynamic transition period was over, not only were the phospholipid acyls retained but some vicinal fatty acyl pairs of phospholipid also appeared to be stable and remained together throughout the depletion period. At any time in the experiment, however, introduction of exogenous fatty acid perturbed this phospholipid acyl retention, delayed the time at which the phospholipid acyl groups no longer moved between phospholipids and also decreased the ultimate number of phospholipid acyl groups retained by strain L mouse fibroblasts.","['Fatty Acids', 'Kinetics', 'L Cells', 'Linoleic Acids', 'Lipids', 'Oleic Acids', 'Phospholipids', 'Sterols']",588578,"[['D10.251'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A11.251.210.505', 'A11.329.228.505'], ['D10.251.355.310.515', 'D10.251.355.343.500'], ['D10'], ['D10.251.355.325.600'], ['D10.570.755'], ['D04.210.500.247.808', 'D10.570.938']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
11283,Retreatment management strategies when first-line tuberculosis therapy fails.,"SETTING: Public ambulatory centers in northern Lima, Peru.OBJECTIVE: To compare two retreatment strategies in Category I failures.DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of Category I failures enrolled between February 1997 and October 2001. Strategy A was a nationwide approach, applying a Category II regimen; if that regimen failed, a standardized regimen including second-line drugs was used. Strategy B was a pilot protocol designed to diagnose and treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); this strategy included drug susceptibility testing (DST) and eliminated the Category II regimen.RESULTS: Of 125 patients that Category I failed to cure, 73 entered Strategy A and 52 entered Strategy B. Almost 90% of those with DST results had MDR-TB. Strategy B was three times more likely than Strategy A to cure patients (79% vs. 38%, RR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.7-5.1) and five times more likely to cure patients than the Category II regimen alone (79% vs. 15%, RR 5.2, 95% CI 3.0-9.2). Strategy B also significantly reduced delays to MDR-TB diagnosis and to the initiation of MDR-TB therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Under program conditions, a retreatment strategy based on DST and eliminating the Category II regimen can improve clinical outcomes among Category I treatment failures found to have active, infectious MDR-TB.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Child', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tuberculosis', 'Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant']",15830748,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.122.085.255'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E02.319.283'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.789.800.760', 'N04.761.559.590.800.760', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.760'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846.775']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
6554,"Non-Orthogonal Random Access in MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks: Beamforming, Power Allocation, and Opportunistic Transmission.","We study secondary random access in multi-input multi-output cognitive radio networks, where a slotted ALOHA-type protocol and successive interference cancellation are used. We first introduce three types of transmit beamforming performed by secondary users, where multiple antennas are used to suppress the interference at the primary base station and/or to increase the received signal power at the secondary base station. Then, we show a simple decentralized power allocation along with the equivalent single-antenna conversion. To exploit the multiuser diversity gain, an opportunistic transmission protocol is proposed, where the secondary users generating less interference are opportunistically selected, resulting in a further reduction of the interference temperature. The proposed methods are validated via computer simulations. Numerical results show that increasing the number of transmit antennas can greatly reduce the interference temperature, while increasing the number of receive antennas leads to a reduction of the total transmit power. Optimal parameter values of the opportunistic transmission protocol are examined according to three types of beamforming and different antenna configurations, in terms of maximizing the cognitive transmission capacity. All the beamforming, decentralized power allocation, and opportunistic transmission protocol are performed by the secondary users in a decentralized manner, thus resulting in an easy implementation in practice.","['Algorithms', 'Artifacts', 'Cognition', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Computer Simulation', 'Radio Waves', 'Wireless Technology']",28076402,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['E05.047'], ['F02.463.188'], ['L01.224.230.110'], ['L01.224.160'], ['G01.358.500.505.810', 'G01.750.250.810', 'G01.750.770.721'], ['L01.178.847.950']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
13704,IFN-alpha/beta signaling is required for polarization of cytokine responses toward a protective type 1 pattern during experimental cryptococcosis.,"The antiviral activities of type I IFNs have long been established. However, comparatively little is known of their role in defenses against nonviral pathogens. We examined here the effects of type I IFNs on host resistance against the model pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. After intratracheal or i.v. challenge with this fungus, most mice lacking either the IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFN-alpha/betaR) or IFN-beta died from unrestrained pneumonia and encephalitis, while all wild-type controls survived. The pulmonary immune response of IFN-alpha/betaR-/- mice was characterized by increased expression of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10, decreased expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, inducible NO synthetase, and CXCL10, and similar levels of IL-12 mRNA, compared with wild-type controls. Histopathological analysis showed eosinophilic infiltrates in the lungs of IFN-alpha/betaR-/- mice, although this change was less extensive than that observed in similarly infected IFN-gammaR-deficient animals. Type I IFN responses could not be detected in the lung after intratracheal challenge. However, small, but statistically significant, elevations in IFN-beta levels were measured in the supernatants of bone marrow-derived macrophages or dendritic cells infected with C. neoformans. Our data demonstrate that type I IFN signaling is required for polarization of cytokine responses toward a protective type I pattern during cryptococcal infection.","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cryptococcosis', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interferon-beta', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate']",18566423,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251'], ['C01.150.703.248'], ['A11.066.270', 'A11.436.270', 'A15.382.066.270', 'A15.382.670.260'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.250', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.250', 'D23.529.374.440.890.250'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.275', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.275', 'D23.529.374.440.890.275'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.400.500'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
18293,"Quantitative, real-time analysis of base excision repair activity in cell lysates utilizing lesion-specific molecular beacons.","We describe a method for the quantitative, real-time measurement of DNA glycosylase and AP endonuclease activities in cell nuclear lysates using base excision repair (BER) molecular beacons. The substrate (beacon) is comprised of a deoxyoligonucleotide containing a single base lesion with a 6-Carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) moiety conjugated to the 5'end and a Dabcyl moiety conjugated to the 3' end of the oligonucleotide. The BER molecular beacon is 43 bases in length and the sequence is designed to promote the formation of a stem-loop structure with 13 nucleotides in the loop and 15 base pairs in the stem. When folded in this configuration the 6-FAM moiety is quenched by Dabcyl in a non-fluorescent manner via F?rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The lesion is positioned such that following base lesion removal and strand scission the remaining 5 base oligonucleotide containing the 6-FAM moiety is released from the stem. Release and detachment from the quencher (Dabcyl) results in an increase of fluorescence that is proportionate to the level of DNA repair. By collecting multiple reads of the fluorescence values, real-time assessment of BER activity is possible. The use of standard quantitative real-time PCR instruments allows the simultaneous analysis of numerous samples. The design of these BER molecular beacons, with a single base lesion, is amenable to kinetic analyses, BER quantification and inhibitor validation and is adaptable for quantification of DNA Repair activity in tissue and tumor cell lysates or with purified proteins. The analysis of BER activity in tumor lysates or tissue aspirates using these molecular beacons may be applicable to functional biomarker measurements. Further, the analysis of BER activity with purified proteins using this quantitative assay provides a rapid, high-throughput method for the discovery and validation of BER inhibitors.","['DNA Glycosylases', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",22895410,"[['D08.811.074.249', 'D08.811.277.450.430.099'], ['G02.111.222', 'G05.219'], ['D08.811.074.750', 'D08.811.520.241.225'], ['D02.455.426.779.347', 'D03.633.300.953.275', 'D04.711.347'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['D13.444.600.601', 'D27.505.259.750.600.650', 'D27.720.470.530.600.650'], ['E05.393.620.500.706']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41167,Delayed pain decrease following M1 tDCS in spinal cord injury: A randomized controlled clinical trial.,"Despite some encouraging findings for the treatment of neuropathic pain in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) directed to the primary motor cortex (M1) has faced some mixed results. Prior to translating this technology to clinical care, consistent results and durable effects need to be found. We, therefore, aimed to assess the direct and long-term effects of tDCS on pain following SCI. We performed a two-phase randomized sham-controlled clinical trial where patients received 5days of tDCS followed by a 3-month follow-up period (Phase I); then, Phase II consisted of 10days of tDCS with an 8-week follow-up period. We assessed the level of pain with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Patients' quality of life and life satisfaction were also evaluated. 33 patients were enrolled in Phase I and 9 in Phase II. We observed a treatment effect at 1-week follow-up for Phase I and at 4-week follow-up for Phase II. The overall level of pain was significantly lower for the active group, as compared to sham, in Phase II. Our exploratory study shows that tDCS does seem to be a promising tool to manage pain in patients with SCI and repeated stimulation sessions are needed to induce long-lasting effects. Based on our protocol, it appears that adding a second treatment period could induce long-lasting effects.

29148,Reliability and validity of the Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients (QLQ-Asthma) in a sample of adult asthmatic patients in Turkey.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to translate the 20-item Questionnaire for the Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients (QLQ-Asthma) into Turkish and to assess the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients among Turkish adult asthmatic patients in Turkey.BACKGROUND: Asthma can adversely affect the physical, psychological and social domains of health-related quality of life. The Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients is a widely used instrument to measure quality of life in asthma patients. The Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients has not been validated in Turkey.DESIGN: Methodological research design.METHODS: This study describes the translation process of Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients into Turkish and tests its reliability and validity on quality of life in asthma patients. The study group was composed of 105 stable adult asthmatic patients. The questionnaire was translated using a back-translation technique. The statistical analysis was carried out using Cronbach's alpha to test the internal consistency of the Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients scale while exploratory factor analysis was carried out using principal component analysis with varimax rotation and Kaiser Normalisation to test its construct validity.RESULTS: The Cronbach's alpha coefficient reliability for the total scale was 0·84, and internal consistency reliability was in the acceptable range for this instrument. Results indicated that respondents did not have difficulty answering the questions in the Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients. Factor analysis resulted in five-factor structure: physical activities, role activities, emotions, social activities and health perceptions.CONCLUSIONS: The Turkish version of the Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients is a reliable and valid supplementary measure of the quality of life in asthma patients, and it is a useful outcome measurement tool for clinical trials conducted in Turkey. RELEVANCE OF CLINICAL PRACTICE: The Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients scale is simple to administer, and Turkish researchers and health care providers can use the Assessment of Quality of Life in Asthma Patients to assess the asthma patients quality of life.","['Adult', 'Asthma', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Psychometrics', 'Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Turkey']",21059126,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.711.780'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['Z01.252.245.500.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

Receptor activator of NF-êB ligand (RANKL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, regulates proliferation of mature T cells. Here, we have studied the expression of RANKL in sciatic nerves of EAN rats. EAN was induced in male Lewis rats. The spatiotemporal expression of RANKL in sciatic nerves of EAN rats was investigated using immunohistochemistry. In sciatic nerves of normal rats RANKL(+) cells were rarely seen. EAN induced a significant accumulation of RANKL(+) cells in sciatic nerves and there was a significant positive correlation of the time course of RANKL(+) cell accumulations with neurological scores of EAN rats. The major cellular resources of RANKL in sciatic nerves were T cells and macrophages. The positive association of RANKL(+) cell accumulations with neurological scores of EAN rats together with the known functions of RANKL indicated that RANKL might play a role in pathologic development of EAN and need further investigation.","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental', ""Freund's Adjuvant"", 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Microglia', 'Neutrophil Infiltration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B', 'Sciatic Nerve', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Time Factors']",22810119,"[['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.050.301.264.035', 'D23.101.100.110'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['E01.370.225.500.195', 'E05.200.500.195', 'E05.242.195', 'G04.140'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['C10.114.703.300', 'C10.228.140.695.562.250', 'C10.314.350.250', 'C20.111.258.625.300', 'E05.598.500.500.500'], ['D20.475'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['A08.637.400', 'A11.650.400'], ['G12.632'], ['D12.644.456'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.280', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.280'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.760.345'], ['A08.800.800.720.450.760'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
207,Quality of life after cerebrovascular stroke: a systematic study of patients' preferences for different functional outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: To elicit valid quality of life estimates and the highest acceptable treatment risk of different outcomes after stroke. This is a prerequisite for rational medical decision-making, especially when considering treatments like thrombolysis.SUBJECTS: Healthy people, non-stroke medical patients and stroke survivors aged 20-84 years (n = 158)INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were interviewed by a physician using three different methods ('standard gamble', 'time trade-off' and 'direct scaling') supported by an interactive computer program.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured utility, a numerical value ranging from 0.00 (death) to 1.00 (perfect health), representing the strength of the patient's preference for an outcome. When using the standard gamble method, risk is also introduced into the measurement.RESULTS: People's preferences for stroke outcomes varied widely, and the estimates were influenced by assessment method. We found that previous stroke, marital status and age were the only independent variables influencing the utility given. Subjects in our population over the age of 45 were very comparable to the real population at risk for acute stroke regarding these three variables, and they assigned a median utility of 0.91 (10th percentile, 0.65; 90th percentile, 0.99) to a minor stroke and 0.61 (10th percentile, 0.08; 90th percentile, 0.95) to a major stroke using the standard gamble method.CONCLUSIONS: Most people do not feel that suffering from stroke is an overwhelming catastrophe and they do not accept treatment options with very high risks.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Marital Status', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",10475999,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C10.228.140.300', 'C14.907.253'], ['E05.245', 'L01.313.500.750.190'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.263.315.500', 'I01.240.361.500', 'I01.880.853.150.423.500', 'N01.224.361.500', 'N01.824.308.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
12856,Hyper-insulinemia increases the glutamate-excitotoxicity in cortical neurons: A mechanistic study.,"Insulin resistance in type-2 diabetic condition increases the risk of stroke and cognitive deficits in which involvement of glutamate has been postulated. It has been hypothesized that hyper-insulinemia in cortical neurons increases the vulnerability towards glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. To mimic insulin resistance, cortical neurons were incubated with high insulin (1 µM) and high glucose (50 mM final concentration) in in-vitro condition for 24 h. Pre-treatment of cortical neurons with high insulin blocked acute insulin-induced activation of Akt and GSK-3â but not in the case of high glucose. Our results demonstrate that chronic high insulin exposure increases glutamate-induced excitotoxity, which was blocked by insulin receptor antagonist (S961) and GSK-3â inhibitor (SB216763). These inhibitors also ameliorated pAkt (Ser473) and pGSK-3â(Ser9) levels after chronic insulin exposure. Increase in glutamate-excitotoxicity in insulin-resistant cortical neurons was found to be associated with increased expression of PICK1.

9824,Molecular characterization of Staphylococcus aureus carrying the panton-valentine leucocidin genes in northern Spain.,"OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) gene in methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus obtained in Gipuzkoa, northeastern area of the Basque Country, north-central Spain, and perform the molecular characterization of PVL-positive isolates.METHODS: Molecular studies comprised: PVL gene detection by PCR, staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) typing, spa sequencing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and detection of the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME).RESULTS: Between 1978 and 2006, only two (0.3%) of the 686 MRSA isolates studied were positive for the PVL gene. This percentage increased between 2007 and 2009, when the PVL gene was detected in 30 of the 679 MRSA (4.4%) and in nine of the 1227 MSSA (0.7%) isolates. The 41 PVL-positive isolates characterized had eight different sequence types (STs). Twenty-three MRSA PVL-positive isolates were ST8, spa type t008, seven of which were ACME positive, erythromycin-resistant and showed the PFGE pattern (90-100% similarity) of the USA300 clone. ST8 was also the most prevalent ST among the nine MSSA PVL-positive isolates.CONCLUSION: The current epidemiology of PVL-positive MRSA in our region more closely resembles that of the USA rather than that of other European countries, being USA300 or USA300-like isolates the most prevalent ones.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Exotoxins', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocidins', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Typing', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spain', 'Staphylococcal Infections', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Virulence Factors', 'Young Adult']",22080089,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D23.946.123'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['D23.946.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['D12.776.543.695.750'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.416', 'E05.393.522', 'H01.158.201.636.475.500', 'H01.158.273.343.595.475.500', 'H01.181.122.650.475.550', 'H02.403.720.500.300', 'N06.850.520.470'], ['E01.370.225.875.150.125.457', 'E05.200.875.150.125.457', 'E05.393.542'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['Z01.542.846'], ['C01.150.252.410.868'], ['B03.300.390.400.800.750.100', 'B03.353.500.750.750.100', 'B03.510.100.750.750.100', 'B03.510.400.790.750.100'], ['D23.946.896'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
10762,Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer: Oncology Nurses Report Attitudes and Barriers to Discussing Fertility Preservation.,"BACKGROUND: Fertility issues have been found to be an important topic for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. Medical technology has made fertility preservation (FP) increasingly effective for postpubertal patients whose treatment course may inhibit their future ability to achieve biologic parenthood. Oncology providers' recommendations have been shown to vary, potentially affecting patients' decision-making processes regarding FP.OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess oncology nurses' recommendations for patients to consider FP options and to explore what patient-related factors may influence discussion of FP with AYAs with cancer.METHODS: 116 oncology nurses participated in this study and were randomized to read one of four vignettes about a patient whose proposed treatment course could affect his or her fertility. Participants' recommendations to partake in FP were analyzed to test for differences by patient age and gender. Open-ended responses to questions about their experiences as oncology nurses were analyzed descriptively.FINDINGS: Nurses strongly recommended that all patients explore FP options before the start of treatment. Oncology nurses endorsed stronger opinions that young adult female patients should be given independent decision-making power to delay treatment for FP, compared to male and female adolescent patients and young adult male patients. Participants mentioned barriers to discussions that included concerns about exacerbating negative emotions and the decision-making capacity of young patients.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Communication', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Fertility Preservation', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms', 'Nurse Clinicians', 'Nurse-Patient Relations', 'Oncology Nursing', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Sex Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",27441525,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['F01.100.050', 'N05.300.100'], ['F01.145.209', 'L01.143'], ['F02.463.785.373'], ['E02.875.800.625', 'E04.936.537.562', 'E05.820.800.625'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04'], ['M01.526.485.650.648.525', 'N02.360.650.648.525'], ['F01.829.401.650.600', 'N05.300.660.560'], ['H02.478.676.605', 'N02.421.533.600'], ['I02.233.332.500', 'N02.421.726.407.680'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['M01.860'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
24849,Noninvasive genotyping and monitoring of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearranged non-small cell lung cancer by capture-based next-generation sequencing.,"Noninvasive genotyping of driver genes and monitoring of tumor dynamics help make better personalized therapeutic decisions. However, neither PCR-based assays nor amplicon-based targeted sequencing can detect fusion genes like anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in blood samples. To investigate the feasibility and performance of capture-based sequencing on ALK fusion detection, we developed a capture-based targeted sequencing panel to detect and quantify rearrangement events, along with other driver mutation variants in plasma. In this perspective study, we screened 364 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for ALK rearrangements, and collected blood samples from 24 of them with confirmed ALK rearrangements based on their tissue biopsies. ALK rearrangements were successfully detected in 19 of 24 patients at baseline with 79.2% (95% CI 57.9%, 92.9%) sensitivity and 100% (36/36) specificity. Among the 24 patients, we obtained longitudinal blood samples from 7 of them after either chemotherapy and/or Crizotinib treatment for disease monitoring. The by-sample detection rate of ALK rearrangements after treatment drops to 69.2% (9 of 13). In addition to detecting ALK rearrangements, we also detected 3 Crizotinib resistant mutations, ALK L1152R, ALK I1171T and ALK L1196M from patient P4. ctDNA concentration correlates with responses and disease progression, reflecting its ability as a biomarker. Our findings suggest capture-based sequencing can detect and quantify ALK rearrangements as well as other somatic mutations, including mutations mediated drug resistance, in plasma with high sensitivity, paving the way for its application in identifying driver fusion genes and monitoring tumor dynamics in the clinic.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Cell-Free Nucleic Acids', 'Circulating Tumor DNA', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genotype', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",27564104,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.002', 'D12.776.543.750.630.002'], ['C04.588.894.797.520.109.220.249', 'C08.381.540.140.500', 'C08.785.520.100.220.500'], ['D13.444.154'], ['D13.444.154.500', 'D13.444.308.425.500'], ['G05.344'], ['G05.380'], ['E05.393.760.319'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400', 'D12.776.543.750.630'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
16544,"Significant differential effects of alendronate, estrogen, or combination therapy on the rate of bone loss after discontinuation of treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with alendronate and estrogen for 2 years increases bone mineral density at the spine and hip more than does therapy with either agent alone. Changes in bone mineral density after discontinuation of therapy have not been compared directly.OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of bone loss when therapy with alendronate, estrogen, or both agents is discontinued.DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation trial.SETTING: 18 U.S. centers.PATIENTS: 244 postmenopausal, hysterectomized women 44 to 77 years of age.INTERVENTION: 2 years of therapy with alendronate, 10 mg/d (n = 92); conjugated estrogen, 0.625 mg/d (n = 143); alendronate and conjugated estrogen (n = 140); or placebo (n = 50). At year 3, women were allocated into five groups: Twenty-eight women continued to take placebo and 44 women continued to take combination therapy, but 50 women taking alendronate, 81 taking conjugated estrogen, and 41 taking combination therapy were switched to placebo.MEASUREMENTS: Bone mineral density and biochemical markers of bone turnover.RESULTS: Women taking alendronate or combination therapy who were switched to placebo for year 3 of the study maintained bone mass. Bone mineral density in these women was 4.1% (CI, 2.6% to 5.7%) and 6.6% (CI, 5.0% to 8.2%) higher, respectively, at the spine (P < 0.001 for both treatment comparisons) and 3.5% (CI, 2.3% to 4.6%) and 3.0% (CI, 1.8% to 4.2%) higher, respectively, at the trochanter (P < 0.001 for both treatment comparisons) than that in women previously taking estrogen who were switched to placebo. In contrast, women who were taking estrogen and were switched to placebo during year 3 experienced a 4.5% decrease at the spine (95% CI, -5.0% to -4.0%) and a 2.4% decrease at the trochanter (CI, -2.7% to -2.1%) (P < 0.001 for both changes). Compared with women who took placebo for 3 years, women who took estrogen for 2 years and were then switched to placebo had a bone mineral density that was 2.9% higher (CI, 1.2% to 4.6%) at the spine (P < 0.05) and 2.9% higher (CI, 1.6% to 4.2%) at the trochanter (P < 0.001). Changes in biochemical markers during year 3 did not differ among the groups that discontinued active treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated bone loss is seen after withdrawal of estrogen therapy but not after withdrawal of alendronate or combination therapy. The differential effects after withdrawal of therapy should be considered in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alendronate', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Density', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Estrogen Replacement Therapy', 'Estrogens, Conjugated (USP)', 'Female', 'Hip', 'Humans', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal', 'Placebos', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Withholding Treatment']",12458987,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D02.705.429.500.100'], ['D23.101'], ['G11.427.100'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E02.319.310'], ['E02.319.452.150'], ['D06.472.334.851.437.988'], ['A01.378.610.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05.116.198.579.610', 'C18.452.104.579.610'], ['D26.660', 'E02.785'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E02.760.952', 'N02.421.585.952']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
15032,The inactivation of ornithine transcarbamoylase by N delta-(N'-sulpho-diaminophosphinyl)-L-ornithine.,"Phaseolotoxin, a tripeptide inhibitor of ornithine transcarbamoylase, is a phytotoxin produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, the causal agent of halo-blight in beans. In vivo the toxin is cleaved to release N delta-(N'-sulpho-diaminophosphinyl)-L-ornithine, the major toxic chemical species present in diseased leaf tissue. This paper reports on the interaction between N delta-(N'-sulpho-diaminophosphinyl)-L-ornithine and ornithine transcarbamoylase. N delta-(N'-Sulpho-diaminophosphinyl)-L-ornithine was found to be a potent inactivator of the enzyme, in contrast with phaseolotoxin, which previously has been reported to inhibit the enzyme reversibly. Inactivation by N delta-(N'-[35S]sulpho-diaminophosphinyl)-L-ornithine resulted in the incorporation of 35S into ethanol-precipitated protein. The stoicheiometry of 35S incorporation was approximately 1 mol/mol of active sites. Inactivation was second-order and a rate constant of 10(6) M-1 X s-1 at 0 degree C in 50 mM-Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, was obtained. Carbamoyl phosphate, a substrate of ornithine transcarbamoylase, protected the enzyme from inactivation. A dissociation constant of 3 microM for the enzyme-carbamoyl phosphate complex was calculated. L-Ornithine, the second substrate for ornithine transcarbamoylase, protected the enzyme only at high concentrations. The results are consistent with N delta-(N'-sulpho-diaminophosphinyl)-L-ornithine being a potent affinity label that binds via the carbamoyl phosphate-binding site of ornithine transcarbamoylase. Cleavage of phaseolotoxin to N delta-(N'-sulpho-diaminophosphinyl)-L-ornithine in vivo appears to be an important function in the physiology of the disease.","['Binding Sites', 'Carbamyl Phosphate', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Ornithine', 'Ornithine Carbamoyltransferase']",4015624,"[['G02.111.570.120'], ['D02.241.081.251.145', 'D02.705.400.100'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D05'], ['D12.125.068.665', 'D12.125.095.765'], ['D08.811.913.555.275.600']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

45864,Effect of hyperinsulinaemia on the function of the pituitary-adrenal axis in healthy man.,"OBJECTIVE: Circulating insulin levels in themselves have been reported to influence the counter-regulatory hormone response to hypoglycaemia in man. The effect of insulin on a specific aspect of this response was examined during euglycaemia by stimulating the pituitary-adrenal axis with human corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH).SUBJECTS: Eight healthy males.DESIGN: Following an overnight fast, insulin was infused at 15 (low) and 60 (high) mU/kg/h from 0900 h for 180 minutes on separate occasions in random order. On each occasion, blood glucose was clamped at euglycaemia, and 1 microgram/kg (i.v. bolus) human CRH was administered at 120 minutes.MEASUREMENTS: Circulating hormone concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Peak cortisol and ACTH responses were compared for the two study conditions.RESULTS: Mean serum insulin levels were threefold higher during the high compared with the low insulin infusion (mean difference 320 pmol/l, 95% confidence interval (CI) 150-490, P < 0.001). Blood glucose levels during the clamps were comparable (mean difference 0.15 mmol/l, 95% CI 0-0.63). Plasma cortisol levels increased following CRH, although the peak concentration was significantly lower during the high insulin infusion (mean difference 36 nmol/l, CI 0-110, P < 0.02). However, peak ACTH levels were comparable for the two insulin levels (mean difference 8 ng/l (1.8 pmol/l), CI 0-50).CONCLUSIONS: The peak cortisol response to CRH was diminished at the higher circulating insulin levels. This was not dependent upon concurrent hypoglycaemia and did not appear to be mediated at the level of the pituitary gland.","['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone', 'Adult', 'Blood Glucose', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Insulin', 'Male', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",8187315,"[['D06.472.699.327.935.531.500', 'D06.472.699.631.525.600.531.500', 'D12.644.400.400.935.531.500', 'D12.644.548.365.935.531.500', 'D12.644.548.691.525.690.531.500', 'D12.776.631.650.405.935.531.500'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.140', 'D12.644.400.400.740.140', 'D12.644.548.365.740.140', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.140'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['A06.300.691'], ['G07.690.773.996']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
6716,[Bone marrow stromal cells co-modified with BMP-2 and bFGF gene].,"AIM: To establish modified bone marrow stromal cells(BMSCs) which can express BMP-2 and bFGF stably.METHODS: BMP-2 and bFGF gene were amplified by RT-PCR, and then cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.0. After being confirmed by DNA sequencing, pcDNA3.0-BMP-2 and pcDNA3.0-bFGF were co-transfected into rat BMSCs with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The expression of BMP-2 and bFGF gene in rat BMSCs was detected by RT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemical staining and ELISA.RESULTS: BMP-2 and bFGF gene were cloned, and their sequences were identical with those in GenBank. The expression plasmids, pcDNA3.0-BMP-2 and pcDNA3.0-bFGF, were constructed and co-transfected into rMSCs successfully. RT-PCR showed the mass transcription of BMP-2 and bFGF mRNA in transfected BMSCs.

28552,Statin initiation and acute kidney injury following elective cardiovascular surgery: a population cohort study in Denmark†.,"OBJECTIVES: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication of cardiac surgery. Statins may prevent post-surgical AKI, yet methodological concerns about existing studies raise questions about the magnitude of a protective effect. We sought to determine the effect of initiating a statin prior to elective cardiac surgery on post-surgical AKI in a regional Danish surgical cohort.METHODS: We identified adults who underwent cardiac surgery during 2006-11 using the Western Denmark Heart Registry. Presurgical medication use, pre- and post-surgical serum creatinine (sCr) measures, and other patient characteristics were obtained from Danish population-based registries. Post-surgical AKI was assessed using sCr measures within 5 days of surgery. The adjusted risk ratio (RR) of AKI and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated for patients who initiated a statin within 100 days prior to surgery compared with patients without prior statin use; long-term statin users were excluded to reduce healthy-user bias. Subanalyses were stratified by surgery type: coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and non-CABG surgeries.RESULTS: We identified 1929 CABG and 1775 non-CABG patients. AKI occurred in 25% of CABG and 28% of non-CABG surgeries, and in 29% of the non-users and 21% of the statin initiators. Half of CABG patients and 9% of non-CABG patients initiated a statin prior to surgery. The adjusted RRs for the effect of statin initiation on AKI were as follows: all surgeries combined, RR = 0.86 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.98); CABG, RR = 0.88 (0.74, 1.05); non-CABG RR = 0.87 (0.68, 1.11).CONCLUSIONS: Presurgical statin initiation is associated with a reduction in AKI risk after cardiac surgery.","['Acute Kidney Injury', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Male', 'Perioperative Period', 'Risk']",26188012,"[['C12.777.419.780.050', 'C13.351.968.419.780.050'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E04.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['Z01.542.816.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.519.186.071.202.370', 'D27.505.519.389.370', 'D27.505.954.557.500.202.370'], ['E04.614', 'N02.421.585.753'], ['E05.318.740.600.800', 'G17.680.750', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
46966,Artifacts detection-based adaptive filtering to noise reduction of strain imaging.,"Strain imaging in medical ultrasound is the imaging modality of elastic properties of biological tissue. In general, strain image will suffer from artifacts noise, which degrades lesion detectability and increases the likelihood of misdiagnosis. How to both suppress artifacts effectively and preserve the structure is vital for diagnosis and also for image post-processing. The bilateral filtering can reduce artifact noise and, at the same time, maintain the tissue structure. However, the balance between noise suppression and edge preservation often makes the threshold selection difficult. This paper is to solve the problem of difficult threshold selection in bilateral filtering. The probability distribution function of amplitude modulation noise in this paper is derived from the statistics of uncompressed speckle. The statistical model of artifact formation is useful for designing an adaptive fast bilateral filter for artifact reduction in ultrasound strain imaging. Both simulation and phantom testing show that the proposed method can improve the quality of ultrasonic strain imaging. Furthermore, the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio was increased by 129.91% and 52.36% for simulated and phantom strain images. The elastographic contrast-to-noise ratio was increased by 521.42% and 218.07% for simulated and phantom strain images, respectively. As indicated by the profiles, the proposed method produces a better result for the purpose of visualization.","['Algorithms', 'Artifacts', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Signal-To-Noise Ratio', 'Ultrasonography']",31238255,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['E05.047'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E07.671'], ['E05.318.370.800.875', 'E05.318.740.872.875', 'G17.800.500', 'N05.715.360.325.700.840', 'N05.715.360.750.725.750', 'N06.850.520.445.800.875', 'N06.850.520.830.872.750'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

31008,Effects of benzylic hydroxyl substitution on the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity of tolazoline.,"The R(-)- and S(+)-enantiomers of alpha-hydroxytolazoline, the benzylic hydroxy-substituted derivative of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, tolazoline, were evaluated at alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in canine saphenous vein. Benzylic hydroxyl substitution of tolazoline in either the R(-) or S(+) configuration significantly decreased affinity at both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Differences in affinity between the R(-)- and S(+)-enantiomers were small, which is characteristic of imidazolines, but in marked contrast to phenethylamines where enantiomeric differences are large. The rank order of affinities at alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors is tolazoline greater than S(+)-alpha-hydroxytolazoline = R(-)-alpha-hydroxytolazoline, which is different from that order predicted by the Easson-Stedman hypothesis (i.e., R(-) greater than S(+) = desoxy).

5752,Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Silver Nanoparticle-Decorated Quercetin Antibacterial Molecular Mechanism.,"Facile and simple method is developed to synthesize silver-nanoparticle-decorated quercetin nanoparticles (QA NPs). Modification suggests that synergistic quercetin (Qe) improves the antibacterial effect of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). Characterization experiment indicates that QA NPs have a diameter of approximately 10 nm. QA NPs show highly effective antibacterial activities against drug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). We explore antibacterial mechanisms using S. aureus and E. coli treated with QA NPs. Through morphological changes in E. coli and S. aureus, mechanisms are examined for bacterial damage caused by particulate matter from local dissociation of silver ion and Qe from QA NPs trapped inside membranes. Moreover, we note that gene expression profiling methods, such as RNA sequencing, can be used to predict discover mechanisms of toxicity of QA NPs. Gene ontology (GO) assay analyses demonstrate the molecular mechanism of the antibacterial effect of QA NPs. Regarding cellular component ontology, ""cell wall organization or biogenesis"" (GO: 0071554) and ""cell wall macromolecule metabolic process"" (GO: 0044036) are the most represented categories.

16288,Coconut oil cake--a potential raw material for the production of alpha-amylase.,"Solid-state fermentation (SSF) was carried out using coconut oil cake (COC) as substrate for the production of alpha-amylase using a fungal culture of Aspergillus oryzae. Raw COC supported the growth of the culture, resulting in the production of 1372 U/gds alpha-amylase in 24 h. Process optimization using a single parameter mode showed enhanced enzyme titre, which was maximum (1827 U/gds) when SSF was carried out at 30 degrees C for 72 h using a substrate with 68% initial moisture. Supplementation with glucose and starch further enhanced enzyme titre, which was maximum (1911 U/gds) with 0.5% starch. However, maltose inhibited the enzyme production. Studies on the effect of addition of external organic and inorganic nitrogenous compounds further showed a positive impact on enzyme synthesis by the culture. Increase of 1.7-fold in the enzyme activity (3388 U/gds) was obtained when peptone at 1% concentration was added to the fermentation medium. The enzyme production was growth-related, the activity being the maximum when the fungal biomass was at its peak at 72 h. Use of COC as raw material for enzyme synthesis could be of great commercial significance. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on alpha-amylase production using COC in SSF.","['Aspergillus oryzae', 'Biomass', 'Bioreactors', 'Coconut Oil', 'Fermentation', 'Glucose', 'Kinetics', 'Maltose', 'Plant Oils', 'Starch', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'alpha-Amylases']",15051078,"[['B01.300.381.081.500'], ['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['D10.627.700.186'], ['G02.111.158.249', 'G03.191.249'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D09.698.365.450', 'D09.698.629.305.523', 'D09.947.750.523'], ['D10.627.700', 'D20.215.784.750'], ['D05.750.078.562.855', 'D09.301.915', 'D09.698.365.855'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D08.811.277.450.066.050']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
14691,Role of intraoperative fibrinolytic therapy in acute arterial occlusion.,"Nineteen patients with acute onset of ischemia affecting the lower extremities were studied from January 1985 to March 1987. Patients with preoperative Doppler and angiographic studies consistent with arterial occlusions subsequently underwent a thromboembolectomy using a Fogarty catheter. All patients were given a bolus injection of 5,000 units of heparin intravenously at the start of the surgical procedure. In all patients studied, a clot was retrieved on the first pass, but after two additional passes, total distal blood flow was not shown to be restored on angiogram. Intraoperative angiograms showed distal emboli. All patients underwent intraoperative fibrinolytic therapy by local bolus infusion. Streptokinase, ranging from 50,000 to 200,000 units, was administered in 50,000 unit injections in ten to 15 minute intervals. Repeat attempts at thromboembolectomy with the Fogarty catheter resulted in an additional clot retrieved in all 19 patients with intraoperative angiographic, Doppler and clinical improvement. No perioperative or postoperative complications were observed, including anaphylactic reactions, uncontrollable bleeding or amputation. Four patients had nonacute femoropopliteal bypass operations within the next six months. Intraoperative fibrinolytic therapy can be a safe and effective adjunct in acute arterial embolic occlusion requiring balloon catheter thromboembolectomy.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Catheterization', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Heparin', 'Humans', 'Leg', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiography', 'Streptokinase', 'Thromboembolism', 'Ultrasonography']",3041635,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E02.148', 'E05.157'], ['E02.186'], ['D09.698.373.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A01.378.610.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.700'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.775', 'D12.776.124.125.662.537'], ['C14.907.355.590'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
16896,Lipase-catalyzed biodiesel production from waste activated bleaching earth as raw material in a pilot plant.,"The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from waste activated bleaching earth (ABE) discarded by the crude oil refining industry using lipase from Candida cylindracea was investigated in a 50-L pilot plant. Diesel oil or kerosene was used as an organic solvent for the transesterification of triglycerides embedded in the waste ABE. When 1% (w/w) lipase was added to waste ABE, the FAME content reached 97% (w/w) after reaction for 12 h at 25 degrees C with an agitation rate of 30 rpm. The FAME production rate was strongly dependent upon the amount of enzyme added. Mixtures of FAME and diesel oil at ratios of 45:55 (BDF-45) and 35:65 (BDF-35) were assessed and compared with the European specifications for biodiesel as automotive diesel fuel, as defined by pr EN 14214. The biodiesel quality of BDF-45 met the EN 14214 standard. BDF-45 was used as generator fuel, and the exhaust emissions were compared with those of diesel oil. The CO and SO2 contents were reduced, but nitrogen oxide emission increased by 10%. This is the first report of a pilot plant study of lipase-catalyzed FAME production using waste ABE as a raw material. This result demonstrates a promising reutilization method for the production of FAME from industrial waste resources containing vegetable oils for use as a biodiesel fuel.","['Candida', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Earth, Planet', 'Fungal Proteins', 'Gasoline', 'Industrial Waste', 'Kerosene', 'Lipase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Sulfur Dioxide']",17629478,"[['B01.300.107.795.095', 'B01.300.381.147', 'B01.300.930.176'], ['D01.200.250', 'D01.362.200', 'D01.650.550.250'], ['G01.060.075.730.700.200'], ['D12.776.354'], ['D20.345.630.540', 'N06.230.132.258.630.540'], ['D20.944.420', 'N06.850.460.710.420'], ['D20.345.630.600', 'N06.230.132.258.630.600'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.400'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['D01.362.810', 'D01.650.550.850.925', 'D01.875.825.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
34474,Characterization of influenza A (H7N9) viruses isolated from human cases imported into Taiwan.,"A novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus causes severe human infections and was first identified in March 2013 in China. The H7N9 virus has exhibited two epidemiological peaks of infection, occurring in week 15 of 2013 and week 5 of 2014. Taiwan, which is geographically adjacent to China, faces a large risk of being affected by this virus. Through extensive surveillance, launched in April 2013, four laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases imported from China have been identified in Taiwan. The H7N9 virus isolated from imported case 1 in May 2013 (during the first wave) was found to be closest genetically to a virus from wild birds and differed from the prototype virus, A/Anhui/1/2013, in the MP gene. The other three imported cases were detected in December 2013 and April 2014 (during the second wave). The viruses isolated from cases 2 and 4 were similar in the compositions of their 6 internal genes and distinct from A/Anhui/1/2013 in the PB2 and MP genes, whereas the virus isolated from case 3 exhibited a novel reassortment that has not been identified previously and was different from A/Anhui/1/2013 in the PB2, PA and MP genes. The four imported H7N9 viruses share similar antigenicity with A/Anhui/1/2013, and their HA and NA genes grouped together in their respective phylogenies. In contrast with the HA and NA genes, which exhibited a smaller degree of diversity, the internal genes were heterogeneous and provided potential distinctions between transmission sources in terms of both geography and hosts. It is important to strengthen surveillance of influenza and to share viral genetic data in real-time for reducing the threat of rapid and continuing evolution of H7N9 viruses.","['Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza, Human', 'Male', 'Taiwan']",25748033,"[['G05.045.250', 'G16.075.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B04.820.480.968.405.400.800'], ['C01.748.310', 'C01.925.782.620.365', 'C08.730.310'], ['Z01.252.474.872', 'Z01.639.850']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
4792,Correlation of symptom criteria with perception thresholds during rectosigmoid distension in irritable bowel syndrome patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Due to a lack of reliable biological markers, the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is based on symptom criteria. The possible physiological correlates of these criteria are not known. Our aims were to identify correlations of currently used IBS symptom criteria with distinct alterations in visceral perception.METHODS: Forty-two IBS patients (51% women) with a mean age of 39.5+/-1.4 yr, were included; 64% of patients were recruited from advertisement and 36% were clinic referrals. Patients completed a bowel symptom questionnaire, which included the Rome criteria and symptom severity ratings. Rectal discomfort thresholds were evaluated in all patients and in 19 controls, using a nonbiased tracking protocol consisting of phasic rectal balloon distensions before (PreTh) and after (PostTh) repetitive, high-pressure sigmoid distensions. We assessed the effect of each Rome criteria and symptom severity on PreTh and PostTh.RESULTS: IBS symptom severity was reported as moderate in 38.1% and as severe in 61.9% of patients. Overall, lower thresholds were observed in IBS patients than in controls (PreTh: 28.2+/-1.7 vs. 36.3+/-2.8 mm Hg, p<0.05; PostTh: 25.3+/-1.5 vs. 34.2+/-2.7 mm Hg, p<0.01). When assessing the effect of Rome criteria on rectal thresholds, we found that patients with hard/lumpy stools had lower thresholds than those without them, whereas patients with loose watery stools had higher thresholds than those who lacked them (both p<0.05). The lowering of rectal discomfort thresholds after sigmoid stimulation was observed regardless of the presence or absence of any Rome criteria or symptom severity.CONCLUSION: Although a decrease in rectal discomfort thresholds after sigmoid stimulation is seen in IBS regardless of specific symptoms, baseline and postsigmoid stimulation thresholds are lower in IBS patients with constipation-related symptoms.","['Adult', 'Catheterization', 'Colon, Sigmoid', 'Colonic Diseases, Functional', 'Defecation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pain', 'Rectum', 'Sensory Thresholds']",10638575,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E02.148', 'E05.157'], ['A03.556.124.526.356.668', 'A03.556.249.249.356.668'], ['C06.405.469.158.272'], ['G10.261.165'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['A03.556.124.526.767', 'A03.556.249.249.767'], ['F02.463.593.710']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
42754,Initiation patterns of statin therapy among adult patients undergoing intermediate to high-risk non-cardiac surgery.,"BACKGROUND: A growing body of literature has been produced on the potential role of statins in reducing perioperative cardiac events in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. However, evidence remains inconsistent, and little is known about the patterns of perioperative statin use in routine care.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine patterns of perioperative statin initiation among adults undergoing non-cardiac elective surgery in the USA.METHODS: Using data from a large US healthcare insurer, we identified patients aged ?18 years who underwent moderate-risk to high-risk non-cardiac elective surgery between 2003 and 2012 and initiated statins within 30 days before surgery. We evaluated temporal trends of statin initiation and patient characteristics. In a matched analysis, we assessed the effect of temporal proximity to surgery on the likelihood of statin initiation.RESULTS: Of 460,154 patients undergoing surgery, 5628 (12 per 1000 patients) initiated a statin within 30 days before surgery. Statin initiation increased from 8 per 1000 patients in 2003 to 15 in 2012 (p = 0.0022). The increase was more pronounced among patients undergoing vascular surgery (149 initiators per 1000 patients by the end of 2012) and with Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score ?2 (72 per 1000 patients). Proximity to surgery, in particular vascular surgery, was predictive of statin initiation.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of robust evidence, perioperative statin initiation progressively increased from 2003 to 2012, particularly among patients undergoing major vascular surgery and with higher RCRI score. These trends were largely attributable to the initiation of statins in anticipation of non-cardiac surgery rather than routine dyslipidemia treatment.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Utilization', 'Elective Surgical Procedures', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Perioperative Care', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",26494361,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C14'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E02.319.283'], ['N04.452.706.477'], ['E04.249'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.519.186.071.202.370', 'D27.505.519.389.370', 'D27.505.954.557.500.202.370'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.760.731', 'E04.604', 'N02.421.585.722'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
3675,Liver Transplantation and Abuse of Drugs and Alcohol: A Correlation Between Scales of the MMPI-2.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice requires an accurate psychological assessment of subjects with clinical history of alcohol abuse and/or substance abuse (abuse history [AH]) for therapeutic choice. This study aims to identify significant correlations between the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)-2 scales in patients awaiting liver transplantation.METHODS: We evaluated a personality questionnaire containing MMPI-2 scales in the sample of 308 patients (81.8% males and 18.2% females) awaiting liver transplantation. The AH group composed 44.49% of patients and in the abuse free (AF) group, 55.51%. Scales were compared using Shapiro-Wilk test and Mann-Whitney U test. Interrelationships were examined using Spearman's correlation.RESULTS: This analysis found 27 scales of the MMPI-2 that were statistically different between 2 groups (AF and AH). In the AH group, we found a significant correlation between the following pairs of scales: Schizophrenia Scale (Sc) with the Addictions Potential Scale, Social Introversion scale (Si) with the Psychopathic Deviate scale (Pd), and Social Discomfort scale with Pd; the ES scale was negatively correlated with the Sc and Si scales. This interim study showed that the understanding of these indicators is crucial both for the assessment accuracy and for a prediction of the degree of therapy compliance after the transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: The scales of the MMPI-2 indicated a marked tendency to emotional rigidity, a lack of self-esteem and susceptibility judgment. Social introversion and social discomfort trends lead to impulsive behavior and deviant actions that combine poorly with good compliance with treatment.","['Alcoholism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation', 'MMPI', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Compliance', 'Personality', 'Substance-Related Disorders', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Waiting Lists']",27109962,"[['C25.775.100.250', 'F03.900.100.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.095.147.725.490', 'E04.210.650', 'E04.936.450.490', 'E04.936.580.490'], ['F04.711.647.513.607'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.100.150.750.500.600', 'F01.145.488.887.500.600', 'N05.300.150.800.500.600'], ['F01.752'], ['C25.775', 'F03.900'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['N04.452.095.738']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

16448,[Hypogangliosis of the sigmoid colon: possibilities of sonographic diagnosis].,"This case report concerns a 53-year old woman suffering from recurrent spastic pain and a painful ""resistance"" in the left lower bowel for the last 30 years. Earlier clinical investigations including endoscopy and laparoscopy did not yield any results. In a recent investigation, only sonography showed wall thickening and an echo-poor wall pattern of the sigmoid colon indicating this to be the site of painful resistance.

24063,A meta-analysis of safety and effectiveness of perioperative beta-blocker use for the prevention of cardiac events in different types of noncardiac surgery.,"OBJECTIVE: Perioperative beta-blocker therapy has been proposed to improve outcome. Most of the trials conducted, however, lacked statistical power to evaluate the incidence of hard cardiac events and the relationship to the type of surgery. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials in which beta-blocker therapy was evaluated.METHODS: An electronic search of published reports on Medline was undertaken to identify studies published between January 1980 and November 2004 in English language journals. All studies reported on at least one of three endpoints: perioperative myocardial ischemia, perioperative nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiac mortality. Type of surgery, defined as low, intermediate, and high risk according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, was noted.RESULTS: In total, 15 studies were identified, which enrolled 1,077 patient. No significant differences were observed in baseline clinical characteristics between patients randomized to beta-blocker therapy and control/placebo. Beta-blocker therapy was associated with a 65% reduction in perioperative myocardial ischemia (11.0% vs. 25.6%; odds ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.54; P<0.001). Furthermore, a 56% reduction in myocardial infarction (0.5% vs. 3.9%, odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.97; P=0.04) and a 67% reduction (1.1% vs. 6.1%, odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.67; P=0.002) in the composite endpoint of cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction were observed. No statistical evidence was observed for heterogeneity in the treatment effect in subgroups according to type of surgery (P for heterogeneity 0.2).CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that beta-blocker use in noncardiac surgical procedures is associated with a significant reduction of perioperative cardiac adverse events.","['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Death, Sudden, Cardiac', 'Humans', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Perioperative Care', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative']",16474237,"[['D27.505.519.625.050.200.200', 'D27.505.696.577.050.200.200'], ['C14.280.383.220', 'C23.550.260.322.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.280.647', 'C14.907.585'], ['E02.760.731', 'E04.604', 'N02.421.585.722'], ['E04']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
46687,[Influence of celecoxib on invasiveness of human high-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-2Z].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect and mechanism (a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor) on invasive ability of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) line CNE-2Z.METHODS: The proliferation of NPC cells was examined by MTT assay. The invasive and migrating ability of NPC cells was detected with transwell chamber. E-cadherin protein expression was detected by immunocytochemistry and the expressions of Cox-2 and E-cadherin mRNA were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).RESULTS: MTT showed that celecoxib inhibited CNE-2Z proliferation in dose-dependent manner, the survival rate of cells treated with 25, 50, 100 µmol/L celecoxib (x(-) ± s) for 24 h was (94.75 ± 1.34)%, (91.77 ± 2.70)%, (64.54 ± 1.20)%, respectively, and the survival rate of cells treated for 48 h was (88.41 ± 1.28)%, (78.84 ± 1.56)%, (52.46 ± 2.25)%, respectively, the concentration of 50% inhibition concentration of a substance (IC50) was 100 µmol/L, the difference was statistically significant between different concentration groups in the same time-point (respectively, F were 462.204 and 1328.306, P < 0.01). Treated with different concentrations of celecoxib (0, 25, 50 µmol/L) for 24, the cell numbers (x(-) ± s) through PVPF by tumor invasion assay were (263.7 ± 13.5), (185.3 ± 8.7) and (144.0 ± 8.2), the difference was statistically significant between the experimental and control group (F = 102.089, P < 0.01). Immunocytochemistry showed that celecoxib significantly induced the increase of E-cadherin protein expression, also with a dose-dependence in 0 µmol/L, 25 µmol/L, 50 µmol/L group was (21.7 ± 2.6), (28.7 ± 2.4), (40.3 ± 1.3), and 50 µmol/L group increased significantly (F = 78.637, P < 0.01). RT-PCR showed that celecoxib reduced the expression of Cox-2 mRNA expression in 25, 50 µmol/L group decreased significantly compared with the control group (respectively, t were 23.950 and 36.651, P < 0.01), but it enhanced the expression of E-cadherin mRNA expression in 25, 50 µmol/L group was significantly higher (respectively, t were 35.829 and 81.497, P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Celecoxib can inhibits the invasive ability of NPC cell line CNE-2Z, which possibly relates with the upregulated expression of E-cadherin.","['Apoptosis', 'Cadherins', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Celecoxib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pyrazoles', 'Sulfonamides']",21215211,"[['G04.146.954.035'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200.200', 'D23.050.301.350.200'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['D02.065.884.247', 'D02.886.590.700.247', 'D03.383.129.539.160'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G05.308.370'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.443.665.710.650', 'C07.550.350.650', 'C07.550.745.650', 'C09.647.710.650', 'C09.775.350.650', 'C09.775.549.650'], ['C04.697.650', 'C23.550.727.650'], ['D03.383.129.539'], ['D02.065.884', 'D02.886.590.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

42951,Assessing DSM-5 section III personality traits and disorders with the MMPI-2-RF.,"An alternative model for diagnosing personality disorders (PDs) appears in DSM-5 Section III. This model includes a set of dimensional personality traits, which along with impairment in personality functioning can be configured to represent one of six PDs. Although specific assessment instruments for these personality traits have already been developed (e.g., the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 [PID-5]), clinicians will likely continue to use omnibus measures of psychopathology that are familiar to them to inform diagnostic decision making. One such measure, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF), will likely remain in the test armamentarium of many practitioners and be employed to assess the DSM-5 dimensional traits. In the current investigation, we examined the associations between MMPI-2-RF scale scores and the PID-5 trait scores and DSM-5 Section III PDs in a combined sample of university students (n = 668) from the United States and Canada. Our results indicated that the MMPI-2-RF scale scores mostly converge with PID-5 dimensional traits as well as the Section III PDs in a conceptually expected manner. As such, we conclude that the MMPI-2-RF is a potentially useful instrument in assessing personality psychopathology as conceptualized in DSM-5 Section III.","['Adolescent', 'Character', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MMPI', 'Male', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Disorders', 'Psychometrics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Young Adult']",24220212,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.752.190'], ['L01.453.245.945.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.711.647.513.607'], ['F04.513'], ['F03.675'], ['F04.711.780'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
5956,"Oral habits, dental trauma, and occlusal characteristics among 4- to 12-year-old institutionalized orphan children in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","The aim of this study was to assess the oral habit practices, dental trauma, and occlusal characteristics of 4- to 12-year-old orphans living in governmental orphanages in Riyadh. This cross-sectional study was conducted in three government orphanages and three ordinary schools. All 90 orphans, residing in the orphanage, were included. Ninety schoolchildren were selected to serve as the controls. Demographic data, oral habit history, and dental trauma history were obtained through a questionnaire. All children were examined to confirm the presence of signs of oral habits, dental trauma, and associated occlusal characteristics. Pearson chi-square was used for statistical analysis. Orphans were found to have more digit sucking and oral self-mutilation habits; however, the control children were found to have more nail biting habit. Nearly 21% of the orphans had dental trauma compared to 10% of the control group. About 70% of the dental trauma affected permanent teeth among orphans, whereas, 85% affected primary teeth in the control children. Dental trauma increased as the orphans got older; however, it decreased significantly as the control children got older. Orphans were found to have more cross-bite, increased over-jet, and open-bite. Digit sucking habit was positively associated with class II molar relation, presence of posterior cross-bite, and open-bite. Orphans had increased prevalence of digit sucking habit, self-mutilation, dental trauma, and malocclusion.","['Child', 'Child, Orphaned', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Fingersucking', 'Habits', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Malocclusion', 'Nail Biting', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Self Mutilation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tooth Injuries']",27118440,"[['M01.060.406'], ['M01.108'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['F01.145.466.263'], ['F01.145.466'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C07.793.494'], ['F01.145.466.554'], ['Z01.252.245.500.750'], ['C26.780', 'F01.145.126.980.750'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['C07.793.850', 'C26.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
21650,Effect of feeding Sarsaponin in cattle and swine diets.,"In four trials, steer calves were received in the feedlot, processed and fed diets supplemented with soybean meal (SBM), 1% urea (UR) or 1% urea plus sarsaponin (S) over a 28-d period. In trials 1 and 2, the feeding period was extended to approximately 62 d, in which steers were fed a common (SBM) diet the last 34 d. In trials 3 and 4, a SBM plus S diet treatment was included. During the first 28 d (four trial summary) daily gains of steers fed urea plus S (.74 kg) were intermediate to and significantly different from gains of steers fed SBM (.84 kg) or UR (.66 kg) diets. However, at the end of the 62-d feeding period (two trial summary) daily gains, feed intakes and feed efficiency did not differ (P greater than .05) among treatments. No significant improvements in performance were found in steers fed SBM diets supplemented with S. In swine trials, pigs were fed diets containing no additive, 63 mg S X kg-1, 55 mg chlortetracycline (C) X kg-1 or S plus C in a grower-finisher (GF) and grower (G) trial. In the GF trial, overall efficiency of feed conversion was improved (P less than .05) by feeding S or S plus C. In the G trial, daily gains and intakes were greatest for pigs fed S plus C and differed (P less than .1) from those of pigs fed S or C in the diet. Compared with feeding S or C alone, gain and intake of growing pigs were stimulated to a greater extent when S was fed in combination with C. Feeding S with or without C improved efficiency of feed conversion in finishing pigs.","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Cattle', 'Female', 'Male', 'Sapogenins', 'Saponins', 'Spirostans', 'Swine']",3610886,"[['G07.203.300.300.100', 'J02.500.300.100'], ['B01.050'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D02.455.849.919.650', 'D04.210.500.795'], ['D09.408.782'], ['D04.210.500.247.515'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
29877,Neutrophil immunosurveillance for heart transplant rejection: a prospective study.,"Immunologic surveillance for rejection detection in human heart transplantation offers many potential advantages. To date, investigative efforts have focused primarily on the acquired immune system, particularly the lymphocyte. Little attention has been given to aspects of innate immune function. We have previously reported that perioperative neutrophil adhesion molecule expression is associated with early rejection episodes after human cardiac transplantation. Herein we have investigated the utility of neutrophil immunosurveillance in human heart transplant recipients at later time points. We recruited patients more than 3 months after transplantation. Neutrophil assessment was performed simultaneously with an endomyocardial biopsy that showed rejection. No significant relationship was seen between neutrophil maturity (P = .622; n = 34), adhesion marker expression (P = .567; n = 34), respiratory burst (P = .604; n = 34), or apoptosis rates (P = .662; n = 34) and contemporary rejection status at >3 months after transplantation. However, interesting relationships were noted between neutrophil adhesion markers at this late stage and historical rejection status. Higher levels of the adhesion protein CD11b observed at this late stage were significantly associated with a history of higher rejection grades in the first postoperative biopsy (Spearman rank coefficient 0.359; R = 0.304; P = .005; n = 62). Other aspects of neutrophil function and persistence were not significantly associated with rejection history. This finding, combined with the previously reported findings, supports a role for an individual phenotype in neutrophil function in early rejection episodes after transplantation.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'CD11b Antigen', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Burst']",20620524,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.074.750', 'D12.776.543.550.200.093.750', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.100.150', 'D12.776.543.750.705.833.062', 'D23.050.301.350.074.049'], ['G12.875.545.328'], ['E04.100.376.475', 'E04.928.220.390', 'E04.936.450.475'], ['E01.370.225.812.385', 'E05.200.812.385', 'E05.478.594.385'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['G03.197.620', 'G04.270.620']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
12905,"From empathic mind to moral behaviour: the ""who"", ""why"" and ""how"".","In this paper, I start by suggesting a new definition of empathy. I go on by answering the question of ""Who feels empathy?"". I list some examples of people, illustrating how the level of feeling empathy differs from one category of people to another. It's actually almost everybody who feels empathy: the baby, the good Samaritan and the other two priests, the tax evader, the psychopath, the judges, juries, lawyers, the politician, the bully adolescent, the therapist, etc.… Then I explain, ""Why empathy is experienced/felt differently?"", by drawing on some neuroscience data, and some literature in psychology or philosophy along with some personal suggestions or assumptions. Just to mention one plausible data: we know that the human brain is half developed at birth. It takes twelve to fourteen years for the brain to fully develop. And the frontal lobe continues to develop until the third decade of life! I suggest we must attend to these phases of brain development to learn empathy since that is when the plasticity of the brain and the learning kick-in. Hence, the third section of the paper demonstrates ""How can we develop an empathic mind/behaviour given the nature of our empathic brain?"": with some supportive research and studies, I justify the statement that ""ideally from early age, and all the way up to adulthood, empathy can be learned through nurturing, education, imitation…, through alternative realities such as mindfulness and awareness, and through therapy, memory improvement, training programs, etc.…"" In the conclusion, I assert, using some philosophical thoughts and analogies, that a fully developed empathic behaviour, that embraces all three aspects cognitive, affective and compassionate empathy, being the opposite of indifference, is the vehicle to a peaceful, harmonious and just society.","['Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Empathy', 'Human Development', 'Humans', 'Morals', 'Philosophy, Medical', 'Psychology, Developmental']",26924202,"[['F01.145'], ['A08.186.211'], ['F02.463.188'], ['F01.752.355', 'F01.752.543.500.500'], ['F01.525', 'G07.345.374'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.500', 'K01.752.566'], ['K01.752.667'], ['F04.096.628.270']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]']",1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
12940,"Monoclonal antibody, KK1, recognizes human retinal astrocytes and distinguishes a subtype of astrocytes in mouse brain.","Astrocytes exhibit a diverse morphology and numerous functions in the central nervous system as well as in the retina. In order to obtain markers for the analysis of astrocytes, we prepared monoclonal antibodies that recognized antigens specific to astrocytes. Monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated KK1, reacted with the processes of astrocytes in the nerve fiber layer and the ganglion cell layer in the human retina as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Normal M?ller cells, whose processes are localized vertically in retina, were not labeled by KK1 mAb. In mouse brain, KK1 mAb reacted specifically with astrocytes in the white matter, but not with those in the gray matter. Studies employing a high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscope and double-labeling with KK1 mAb and commercially available anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mAb (GA5) revealed that KK1 mAb visualized the processes that were not recognized by anti-GFAP mAb (GA5) in both human retina and mouse brain. In cultured mouse astrocytes, KK1 mAb reacted only with anti-GFAP mAb (GA5)-positive cells, but a small percentage of anti-GFAP mAb (GA5)-positive cells were labeled with KK1 mAb. In addition, the subcellular distribution of the KK1 antigen in cultured astrocytes apparently differed from that of GFAP labeled by anti-GFAP mAb (GA5). The antigen that was purified from the normal mouse brain by KK1 mAb-conjugated beads reacted with anti-GFAP mAb(GA5) in immunoblotting. No reactivity of KK1 mAb was observed in immunohistochemical analysis in GFAP -/- mutant mouse brain. These results demonstrate that KK1 mAb specifically recognized an epitope of GFAP that did not react with other anti-GFAP mAb (GA5). Retinal astrocytes and a subtype of astrocytes in the white matter of mouse brain shared the epitope that was recognized by KK1 mAb.

43516,Naturally occurring mucoepidermoid carcinoma in the submandibular salivary gland of two mice.,"Mucoepidermoid carcinomas in two mice were investigated histologically, immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally. The neoplastic cells showed divergent differentiation into periodic acid-Schiff-positive mucous cells, keratin-positive squamous cells, and cells with both mucous granules and sheaves of tonofilaments. Gland formation and keratinization were not observed. At the periphery of tumour cell nests, some cells were immunolabelled for smooth muscle actin or contained concentrated thin filaments, and these observations were interpreted to indicate that murine mucoepidermoid carcinomas are associated with both myoepithelium and duct epithelium.","['Actins', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Keratins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Rodent Diseases', 'Submandibular Gland Neoplasms']",9573510,"[['D05.750.078.730.250', 'D12.776.210.500.100', 'D12.776.220.525.255'], ['B01.050'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.340', 'C04.557.470.590.340'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['D05.750.078.593.450', 'D12.776.220.475.450', 'D12.776.860.607'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['C22.795'], ['C04.588.443.591.824.885', 'C07.465.530.824.885', 'C07.465.815.718.885', 'C07.465.815.882.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
36110,Neuroprotective evaluation of extract of ginger (Zingiber officinale) root in monosodium glutamate-induced toxicity in different brain areas male albino rats.,"In this study, the neuroprotective effect of the extract of ginger (Zingiber officinale) was investigated against MSG-induced neurotoxicity of male albino rat. The daily dose (4 mg kg(-1) b.wt.) i.p. injection of pure monosodium glutamate (MSG) for 30 days and subsequent withdrawal caused a significant decrease in epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) content all tested areas (cerebellum, brainstem, striatum, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus) at most of the time intervals studied. This is may be due to activation of glutamate receptors, which led to increased the intracellular concentration of Ca(+2) ions, so the release of neurotransmitters is increased and the content of monoamines is decreased. After the withdrawal, the decrease in monoamines levels remained in striatum, cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, this may be due to the region specific effect of monosodium glutamate whereas, daily dose (100 mg kg(-1) b.wt.) i.p., injection of Ginger (Zingiber officinale) root extract for 30 days and subsequent withdrawal caused a significant increased in epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) content all tested areas at most of the time intervals studied. This is may be due to inhibition of 5HT-3-receptor effects at the same time the extract blockade of Ca(+2) channel, as result the release of neurotransmitter is decreased and the content is increased. After the extract withdrawal, the increase in monoamine levels remained in brainstem, striatum and hippocampus, this may be due to the region specific effect of the extract. The coadminisration of monosodium glutamate and ginger root extract caused increased in monoamine content in most of the tested brain areas at different time intervals. This is may be due to partly attributable to an antagonistic action of ginger root extracts on monosodium glutamate effect, so the monoamines content was increased. From these results, we can say that the ginger extract has a neuroprotective role against monosodium glutamate toxicity effect.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Ginger', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Plant Roots', 'Rats', 'Sodium Glutamate']",19579948,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.618.937.900.444'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['A18.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.125.067.625.349.850', 'D12.125.119.409.349.575']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
16767,MACF1 links Rapsyn to microtubule- and actin-binding proteins to maintain neuromuscular synapses.,"Complex mechanisms are required to form neuromuscular synapses, direct their subsequent maturation, and maintain the synapse throughout life. Transcriptional and post-translational pathways play important roles in synaptic differentiation and direct the accumulation of the neurotransmitter receptors, acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), to the postsynaptic membrane, ensuring for reliable synaptic transmission. Rapsyn, an intracellular peripheral membrane protein that binds AChRs, is essential for synaptic differentiation, but how Rapsyn acts is poorly understood. We screened for proteins that coisolate with AChRs in a Rapsyn-dependent manner and show that microtubule actin cross linking factor 1 (MACF1), a scaffolding protein with binding sites for microtubules (MT) and actin, is concentrated at neuromuscular synapses, where it binds Rapsyn and serves as a synaptic organizer for MT-associated proteins, EB1 and MAP1b, and the actin-associated protein, Vinculin. MACF1 plays an important role in maintaining synaptic differentiation and efficient synaptic transmission in mice, and variants in MACF1 are associated with congenital myasthenia in humans.","['Actins', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myasthenic Syndromes, Congenital', 'Neuromuscular Junction', 'Pedigree', 'Receptors, Cholinergic', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",30842214,"[['D05.750.078.730.250', 'D12.776.210.500.100', 'D12.776.220.525.255'], ['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['D05.750.078.730', 'D12.776.220.525'], ['D12.776.220.600.450', 'D12.776.631.560'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750.602'], ['D12.776.210.500'], ['G05.365.590.650'], ['C10.668.758.800', 'C16.320.590'], ['A08.800.550.550.550', 'A08.850.550.550', 'A11.284.149.165.420.780.550.550'], ['E05.393.673'], ['D12.776.543.750.720.360'], ['A08.850', 'A11.284.149.165.420.780'], ['G02.111.820.850', 'G04.835.850', 'G07.265.880', 'G11.561.830'], ['E05.393.760.700.825.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
36191,Association between side air bags and risk of injury in motor vehicle collisions with near-side impact.,"BACKGROUND: Side air bags (SABs) have been introduced in an attempt to reduce the risk of injury in near-side-impact motor vehicle collisions (MVCs). The impact of SABs on MVC-related mortality and morbidity has yet to be evaluated with a large population-based study. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of SABs in reducing the risk of injury or death in near-side-impact MVCs.METHODS: A retrospective study investigated outboard front seat occupants involved in police-reported, near-side-impact MVCs using data from the General Estimates System (1997-2000). The risk of MVC-related nonfatal and fatal injury for occupants of vehicles with and without SABs was compared.RESULTS: Front seat occupants of vehicles with SABs had a risk of injury similar to that of occupants of vehicles without SABs (risk ratio [RR], 0.96; 95% CI confidence interval [CI], 0.79-1.15). Adjustment for the potentially confounding effects of age, gender, seat belt use, seating position, damage severity and location, and vehicle body type did not meaningfully affect the association (RR, 0.90; 95% CICI, 0.76-1.08).CONCLUSIONS: There is no association between the availability of SABs and overall injury risk in near-side-impact MVCs. Future research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of SABs in preventing the injuries for which they were specifically designed.","['Accidents, Traffic', 'Adult', 'Air Bags', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Wounds and Injuries']",14501882,"[['N06.850.135.392'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E07.700.100', 'J01.637.708.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C26']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
49287,Molecular-recognition-assisted pKa shifts and metal-ion-induced fluorescence regeneration in p-sulfonatocalix[6]arene-encapsulated acridine.,"The host-guest interactions of cationic (AcH(+) ) and neutral (Ac) forms of the dye acridine with the macrocyclic host p-sulfonatocalix[6]arene (SCX6) were investigated by using ground-state absorption, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, and NMR measurements. The cationic form undergoes significant complexation with SCX6 (Keq =2.5?10(4)  M(-1) ), causing a sharp decrease in the fluorescence intensity and severe quenching in the excited-state lifetime of the dye. The strong binding of the AcH(+) form of the dye with SCX6 is attributed to ion-ion interactions involving the sulfonato groups (SO3 (-) ) of SCX6 and the positively charged AcH(+) at pH of approximately 4.3. Whereas, the neutral Ac form of the dye undergoes weak complexation with SCX6 (Keq =0.9?10(3)  M(-1) ) and the binding constant is lowered by one order of magnitude compared with that of the SCX6-AcH(+) system. The strong affinity of SCX6 to the protonated form leads to a large upward pKa shift (?2 units) in the dye. In contrast, strong emission quenching upon SCX6 interaction and the regeneration of fluorescence intensity of the dye in the presence of Gd(3+) through competitive binding have also been demonstrated.","['Acridines', 'Calixarenes', 'Gadolinium', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Phenols', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Sulfones']",25404418,"[['D03.633.300.046'], ['D04.345.025'], ['D01.268.558.362.484', 'D01.552.550.399.484'], ['G02.300'], ['D01.248.497'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657'], ['E05.196.712.516.600.676', 'E05.196.867.726'], ['D02.886.590']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To assess the contribution of genes in the 4p region to suicide risk, we genotyped 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms from a 49Mb region on the chromosome arm 4p11-16 in a total of 288 male suicide victims and 327 healthy male volunteers. The nonsynonymous variants rs1383180 in EVC gene, rs6811863 in TBC1D1 gene, rs362272 in HTT gene, and rs734312 in WFS1 gene were associated to the male completed suicide. However, only EVC polymorphism remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (P < .05 after 10 K permutations). The function of these genes is not clear yet. WFS1 and HTT are related to the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and TBC1D1 is a GTPase activator.

28481,Effects of nutraceuticals on sexual satisfaction and lower urinary tract symptoms in a cohort of young-old men.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nutraceuticals containing multiple supplemental facts (Virherbe®/Rekupros®) on sexual satisfaction and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in young-old men. In an open-label trial, 40 males (mean age 66 ± 13) with sexual disturbances and mild LUTS but without cognitive/motor impairment and clinical hypogonadism were enrolled. Sexual desire (SD; IIEF-SD domain) and satisfaction (Global Assessment Question; GAQ), the capacity to perform daily activities (evaluated by 6-min walking test [6MWT]), and International Prostate Symptoms Scores (IPSS) were evaluated before and after oral administration of 2 capsules/day of each supplement for 8 weeks. The difference from baseline for SD was +2.6 (p < .05) and -4.2 points for IPSS (p < .05), with significance in subscales of urinary streaming/nocturia (p < .01), respectively; 6MWT increased from 507 ± 44 versus 527 ± 58 meters (p < .001). GAQ scale-responses showed overall improvement in overall 75% population, with a significant improvement in QoL (p < .01). These changes returned to baseline at 1-month withdrawal follow-up. No adverse events were reported. These supplemental facts improved sexual desire, satisfaction with sex life, physical performance, and LUTS in young-old men, suggesting that they may be effective in patients in whom standard treatments are not suitable.","['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Humans', 'Libido', 'Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms', 'Male', 'Orgasm', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Treatment Outcome']",29168235,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['G07.203.300.456', 'J02.500.456'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.739.794.511'], ['C23.888.942.343'], ['G08.686.784.460'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['F01.145.802'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
42429,Interstitial lung disease associated with Equine Infectious Anemia Virus infection in horses.,"EIA (Equine Infectious Anemia) is a blood-borne disease primarily transmitted by haematophagous insects or needle punctures. Other routes of transmission have been poorly explored. We evaluated the potential of EIAV (Equine Infectious Anemia Virus) to induce pulmonary lesions in naturally infected equids. Lungs from 77 EIAV seropositive horses have been collected in Romania and France. Three types of lesions have been scored on paraffin-embedded lungs: lymphocyte infiltration, bronchiolar inflammation, and thickness of the alveolar septa. Expression of the p26 EIAV capsid (CA) protein has been evaluated by immunostaining. Compared to EIAV-negative horses, 52% of the EIAV-positive horses displayed a mild inflammation around the bronchioles, 22% had a moderate inflammation with inflammatory cells inside the wall and epithelial bronchiolar hyperplasia and 6.5% had a moderate to severe inflammation, with destruction of the bronchiolar epithelium and accumulation of smooth muscle cells within the pulmonary parenchyma. Changes in the thickness of the alveolar septa were also present. Expression of EIAV capsid has been evidenced in macrophages, endothelial as well as in alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, as determined by their morphology and localization. To summarize, we found lesions of interstitial lung disease similar to that observed during other lentiviral infections such as FIV in cats, SRLV in sheep and goats or HIV in children. The presence of EIAV capsid in lung epithelial cells suggests that EIAV might be responsible for the broncho-interstitial damages observed.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equine Infectious Anemia', 'Female', 'France', 'Horse Diseases', 'Horses', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine', 'Lung', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Romania', 'Viral Core Proteins']",24289102,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A11.436'], ['C01.925.782.815.616.300', 'C01.925.839.375', 'C22.488.304'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['C22.488'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.984.235.472'], ['B04.820.650.589.520.400'], ['A04.411'], ['C08.381.483'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['Z01.542.248.764'], ['D12.776.964.970.600.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

7461,Juxta-articular Myxoma of the Temporomandibular Joint.,"The juxta-articular myxoma represents a benign mesenchymal neoplasm that arises from tissue within or adjacent to a joint space. There have been a number of reported cases involving myxomas of the knee, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hip. To our knowledge there, however, have been no reported cases of juxta-articular myxomas of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This report describes the case of a 57-year-old woman with a juxta-articular myxoma of the left TMJ extending into the infratemporal fossa (ITF). Access to the tumor was accomplished via a preauricular incision and low condylar osteotomy which allowed for displacement of the condyle for direct visualization and excision of the tumor. The postoperative course was benign and the patient demonstrated no cosmetic or functional limitation. Likewise, follow-up at 30 months showed no evidence of recurrence. Benign encapsulated tumors of the ITF can be effectively accessed by means of a modified preauricular incision, low condylar osteotomy, and anterior meniscal release. This direct approach allows for excellent surgical exposure, minimal surgical site morbidity, and maintenance of physiologic joint function and occlusion.","['Cranial Fossa, Middle', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Mandibular Condyle', 'Middle Aged', 'Myxoma', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Osteotomy', 'Temporal Bone', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders']",26594976,"[['A01.456.830.165', 'A02.835.232.781.750.165'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.502.632.600', 'A14.521.632.600'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.557.450.565.550'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['E04.555.580'], ['A02.835.232.781.885'], ['C05.500.607.221.897', 'C05.550.905', 'C05.651.243.897', 'C07.320.610.291.897', 'C07.678']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
25121,Spectrofluorimetric methods for the determination of gemifloxacin in tablets and spiked plasma samples.,"Two new, sensitive and selective spectrofluorimetric methods have been developed for the determination of gemifloxacin (GFX) in tablets and spiked plasma samples. Gemifloxacin, as a primary amine compound, reacts with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzofurazon (NBD-Cl) (for method A) and fluorescamine (for method B) which are a highly sensitive fluorogenic reagents used in many investigations. For method A, the reaction product was measured spectrofluorimetrically at 516 nm with excitation at 451 nm. The reaction proceeded quantitatively at pH 8.5, 80 °C in 7 min. For method B, the method was based on the reaction between GFX and fluorescamine in borate buffer solution of pH 8.5 to give highly fluorescent derivatives that were measured at 481 nm using an excitation wavelength of 351 nm. The fluorescence intensity was directly proportional to the concentration over the range 40-200 ng mL(-1) and 100-1,200 ng mL(-1) for method A and B, respectively. Successful applications of the developed methods, for the drug determination in pharmaceutical preparations and spiked plasma samples, were performed.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Gemifloxacin', 'Humans', 'Naphthyridines', 'Reference Standards', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tablets']",20981565,"[['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['D03.633.100.810.835.322'], ['D03.633.100.612.250', 'D03.633.100.810.835.322.322'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.612'], ['E05.978.808'], ['E05.196.712.516.600.676', 'E05.196.867.726'], ['D26.255.830']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

45406,Late diagnosis of spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas resulting in severe lower-extremity weakness: a case series.,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) is a slow-flow extramedullary vascular lesion affecting primarily the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. The clinical sequela of these vascular changes is progressive myelopathy and severe lower-extremity weakness. Although surgical or embolic treatment of SDAVFs has improved significantly in the last years, the ambiguity of the symptoms may complicate and delay the diagnosis. The influence of the postponed diagnosis on the functional outcome of patients with SDAVF is unknown.PURPOSE: To describe a case series of patients with SDAVF that illustrates that delayed diagnosis leads to grave neurologic and functional prognosis.STUDY DESIGN: A case series.METHODS: We present a series of seven patients, treated in a tertiary university rehabilitation center over 20 years. Clinical, radiologic, and functional outcomes were evaluated by retrospective chart review. Neurologic and functional evaluation at the end of rehabilitation was evaluated with the lower extremities motor score and the Aminoff-Logue scale, respectively.RESULTS: All our patients were men with a mean age of 60.3±16 years (30-72 years), mean time until the diagnosis of SDAVF was 302.8±239 days (60-730 days), and mean overall length of stay in acute department and rehabilitation unit was 88.6±34 days (46-149 days). At the end of rehabilitation period, four patients remained at wheelchair level with an Aminoff-Logue scale grading of five whereas other functional scales showed also low levels of recovery.CONCLUSIONS: Our series showed that the potential for functional ambulation was poor despite prolonged rehabilitation treatment in late diagnosis SDAVF. Awareness of the early symptoms of SDAVF and immediate intervention may help reduce impairment in such patients.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations', 'Delayed Diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spinal Cord Diseases']",24246747,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C10.500.190', 'C14.240.850.875', 'C16.131.240.850.875', 'C16.131.666.190'], ['E01.110', 'E02.760.273', 'N02.421.585.273'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C10.228.854']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
39837,Sorption-desorption behavior of pesticides and their degradation products in volcanic and nonvolcanic soils: interpretation of interactions through two-way principal component analysis.,"Sorption-desorption behavior of six pesticides and some degradation products was assessed on seven agricultural volcanic and nonvolcanic soils belonging to Andisol, Ultisol, Mollisol, and Alfisol orders. The global interpretation of sorption data was performed by principal component analysis. Results showed exceptionally high sorption of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) (the breakdown product) on volcanic soils (K f > 1500 ìg(1 - 1 / n) mL(1 / n) g(-1)) related mainly to contents of amorphous aluminum oxides (Andisols) and crystalline minerals (Ultisols). The lower sorption on nonvolcanic soils was associated to low organic matter contents and lack of significant minerals. Metsulfuron-methyl and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (metabolite of chlorpyrifos) were weakly to substantially sorbed on Andisols and Ultisols, but the first one was not sorbed at pH > 6.4, including nonvolcanic soils. The metabolite of diazinon, 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine, was weakly sorbed on all soils (K f = 0.4 to 3.6 ìg(1 - 1 / n) mL(1 / n) g(-1)). Acidic compounds would be lixiviated in Mollisols and Alfisols, but they could leach also in Andisols and Ultisols if they reach greater depths. Atrazine and deethylatrazine sorption was related to organic carbon content; therefore, they were weakly retained on nonvolcanic soils (K f = 0.7 to 2.2 ìg(1 - 1 / n) mL(1 / n) g(-1)). Chlorpyrifos was highly sorbed on all soils reaching K OC values of >8000. Finally, the significant retention of chlorothalonil and diazinon on Mollisols and Alfisols in spite of their low OC contents showed the contribution of clay minerals in the sorption process.","['Adsorption', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Arylsulfonates', 'Atrazine', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Glycine', 'Isoxazoles', 'Organophosphonates', 'Pesticides', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Tetrazoles', 'Volcanic Eruptions', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",25561264,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['D02.886.645.600.080.050'], ['D03.383.931.247'], ['D02.705.400.625.100', 'D02.705.539.345.100', 'D02.886.300.692.100'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D12.125.481'], ['D03.383.129.385'], ['D02.705.429'], ['D27.720.031.700', 'D27.888.723'], ['E05.318.740.562'], ['D20.721', 'G01.311.820', 'G16.500.275.815', 'N06.230.600'], ['D27.888.284.756'], ['D03.383.129.617'], ['G01.311.955'], ['E05.196.309.742', 'E05.196.822.950', 'G01.867.950', 'G02.965']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
11738,Inhibition of angiotensin-1-converting enzyme activity by two varieties of ginger (Zingiber officinale) in rats fed a high cholesterol diet.,"Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This study sought to investigate the inhibitory effect of two varieties of ginger (Zingiber officinale) commonly consumed in Nigeria on ACE activity in rats fed a high cholesterol diet. The inhibition of ACE activity of two varieties of ginger (Z. officinale) was investigated in a high cholesterol (2%) diet fed to rats for 3 days. Feeding high cholesterol diets to rats caused a significant (P<.05) increase in the ACE activity. However, there was a significant (P<.05) inhibition of ACE activity as a result of supplementation with the ginger varieties. Rats that were fed 4% white ginger had the greatest inhibitory effect as compared with a control diet. Furthermore, there was a significant (P<.05) increase in the plasma lipid profile with a concomitant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content in rat liver and heart tissues. However, supplementing the diet with red and white ginger (either 2% or 4%) caused a significant (P<.05) decrease in the plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and in MDA content in the tissues. Conversely, supplementation caused a significant (P<.05) increase in plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level when compared with the control diet. Nevertheless, rats fed 4% red ginger had the greatest reduction as compared with control diet. In conclusion, both ginger varieties exhibited anti-hypercholesterolemic properties in a high cholesterol diet fed to rats. This activity of the gingers may be attributed to its ACE inhibitory activity. However, white ginger inhibited ACE better in a high cholesterol diet fed to rats than red ginger. Therefore, both gingers could serve as good functional foods/nutraceuticals in the management/treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.","['Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cholesterol', 'Ginger', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Plant Extracts', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Triglycerides']",24433069,"[['D27.505.519.389.745.085'], ['B01.050'], ['C14.907.137.126.307'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197', 'D10.570.938.208'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.618.937.900.444'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.047.700'], ['D08.811.277.656.350.350.687'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D10.351.801']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

17413,Mechanical properties of the copper-deficient rat heart.,"Copper deficiency is known to induce cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac morphologic lesions and altered electrocardiograms. These findings suggest that copper deficiency may also influence the mechanical properties of the myocardium. In the present study, weanling albino rats were fed a copper-deficient (-Cu) diet and compared to rats fed the same diet but with copper supplementation in the drinking water (+Cu). Rats were studied during a 1-week period following 4.5-5.5 weeks of treatment. When compared to +Cu rats, the -Cu rats exhibited characteristic signs of copper deficiency, such as reduced body weight, hypoceruloplasminemia, depressed hematocrit, low copper and elevated iron concentration in the liver. The -Cu rats also exhibited cardiac hypertrophy and both a dilution and depletion of left ventricular norepinephrine. Hearts were perfused and paced at both 27 degrees and 37 degrees. When compared to hearts from +Cu rats, the -Cu hearts: 1) had lower spontaneous heart rates, 2) had decreased coronary resistance, 3) gained significant weight during perfusion, 4) consumed more oxygen per unit pressure developed, and 5) developed less systolic pressure with a reduced rate of pressure development. However, the time to peak pressure development, one-halt relaxation time, and refractory period were not affected.

A qualitative study using normalisation process theory within the CASPER plus trial.,"BACKGROUND: Depression in older people may have a prevalence as high as 20%, and is associated with physical co-morbidities, loss, and loneliness. It is associated with poorer health outcomes and reduced quality of life, and is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Older people may find it difficult to speak to their GPs about low mood, and GPs may avoid identifying depression due to limited consultation time and referral options for older patients.METHODS: A qualitative study nested within a randomised controlled trial for older people with moderate to severe depression: the CASPER plus Trial (Care for Screen Positive Elders). We interviewed patient participants, GPs, and case managers (CM) to explore patients' and professionals' views on collaborative care developed for older people, and how this model could be implemented at scale. Transcripts were analysed thematically using normalization process theory.RESULTS: Thirty-three interviews were conducted. Across the three data-sets, four main themes were identified based on the main principles of the Normalization Process Theory: understanding of collaborative care, interaction between patients and professionals, liaison between GPs and case managers, and the potential for implementation.CONCLUSIONS: A telephone-delivered intervention, incorporating behavioural activation, is acceptable to older people with depression, and is deliverable by case managers. The collaborative care framework makes sense to case managers and has the potential to optimize patient outcomes, but implementation requires integration in day to day general practice. Increasing GPs' understanding of collaborative care might improve liaison and collaboration with case managers, and facilitate the intervention through better support of patients. The CASPER plus model, delivering therapy to older adults with depression by telephone, offers the potential for implementation in a resource-poor health service.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Attitude to Health', 'Case Managers', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Female', 'General Practice', 'General Practitioners', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health Services', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Patient Health Questionnaire', 'Psychotherapy', 'Qualitative Research', 'Telephone']",30021506,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['F01.100.050', 'N05.300.100'], ['F01.100.150', 'N05.300.150'], ['M01.526.070.245', 'M01.526.485.215', 'N02.360.215'], ['F01.145.813.115'], ['F03.600.300.375'], ['H02.403.340'], ['M01.526.485.810.485', 'N02.360.810.485'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.408', 'N02.421.461'], ['F01.100.150.750.500', 'F01.145.488.887.500', 'N05.300.150.800.500'], ['E05.318.308.980.493', 'F04.711.580', 'N05.715.360.300.800.485', 'N06.850.520.308.980.485'], ['F04.754'], ['H01.770.644.241.850'], ['L01.178.847.698']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0

4232,Control of illegal medroxyprogesterone acetate-application in veal calves by residue analysis in adipose tissue using HPLC/RIA methods.,"Procedures for the determination of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in adipose tissue collected at time of slaughter allowing the control of MPA application to veal calves are described. Screening radioimmunoassays after sample clean-up were sufficient for a first survey of MPA treatments in livestock herds. Validation of all positive samples was performed by two-dimensional (silica gel diol phase and RP-18 phase) HPLC/RIA immunograms. Megestrol acetate and melengestrol acetate with cross-reactivities of 31% and 0.3% respectively were clearly separated by the RP HPLC. With an absolute detection limit of 4 pg MPA/tube (90% relative binding) negative control samples did not exceed 6 pg/tube, equivalent to 6 pg/g fat in the validating method. Seventeen days after intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 24 mg MPA only 32 pg MPA/g fat were found, while i.m. injection of 60 mg MPA and a waiting period of 19 days resulted in 2700 pg MPA/g fat. After feeding two calves 20 micrograms MPA per head daily for 1 week followed by 200 micrograms MPA per head daily for 2 weeks 359 and 468 pg MPA/g fat were measured. In plasma as well as in adipose tissue more than 80% of the whole immunoreactive material was MPA itself, without indications for the presence of cross-reacting MPA metabolites as confirmed by HPLC/RIA immunograms. Based on day of slaughter ratios of accumulation of MPA from plasma into fat of MPA-fed veal calves were 52 and 72 respectively. In urine MPA was only detectable a few days after injection; as compared to a plasma concentration of 950 pg MPA/ml the amount in urine was only 37 pg MPA/ml and also 325 pg unidentified MPA-equivalents/ml.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug and Narcotic Control', 'Female', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Medroxyprogesterone', 'Medroxyprogesterone Acetate', 'Radioimmunoassay']",2521473,"[['A10.165.114'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['I01.880.604.605.250', 'N03.706.615.402.250', 'N04.452.706.310'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829.395.700'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829.395.700.500'], ['E01.370.384.700', 'E05.478.566.639', 'E05.601.470.639']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
1620,"Scoliosis model created by pedicle screw tethering in immature goats: the feasibility, reliability, and complications.","STUDY DESIGN: An in vivo model of scoliosis was established in immature goats.OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, reliability, and complications of the innovative animal model.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Among the methods of creating a scoliotic model, posterior asymmetric tethering of spine yielded encouraging results. However, some shortcomings associated with the use of posterior asymmetric tether are apparent.METHODS: Fourteen female goats (age: 5-8 weeks old, weight: 6-8 kg), were instrumented and tethered using unilateral pedicle screws and contralateral rib resections. Twelve of the goats were followed up for 8 weeks by serial radiography. Six goats were removed of the posterior load and no treatment was given. Two goats were selected randomly from the 6 animals and subjected to computed tomography (CT) three-dimensional reconstruction after another 8 weeks. All the 6 goats were killed and spine specimens were harvested for histologic study 16 weeks after observation.RESULT: Radiographic observation showed that 12 goats developed scoliosis with convex toward the right side, and the curvature increased with time in 11 goats, and it remained unchanged in 1 animal. The angle immediately after the procedures averaged 29.0 degrees (23 degrees -38 degrees ) and increased to an average of 43.0 degrees (36.0 degrees -58.0 degrees ) over a period of 8 to 10 weeks, with average angle increment being 14.0 degrees (P < 0.001). The curvature ceased to increase in 6 goats during the subsequent 2 months after the tether were removed (P > 0.05). Three-dimensional CT reconstruction revealed that the vertebral bodies were wedged, the 2 sides of the thoracic skeleton were asymmetric, and the vertebrae in the major curve were rotated. Histologic study revealed that the goats remained in growth stage and the growth potential of 2 sides of the spine was not identical.CONCLUSION: Radiography and three-dimensional CT reconstruction of vertebrae revealed that the architectural alterations found in the model were similar to those of idiopathic-type deformity observed in clinical practice.","['Animals', 'Bone Screws', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Goats', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Scoliosis', 'Spine', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",19934810,"[['B01.050'], ['E07.695.370.437', 'E07.858.442.660.460.437', 'E07.858.690.725.460.437'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.513'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E01.370.350.400', 'L01.224.308.410'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['C05.116.900.800.875'], ['A02.835.232.834'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
32913,Results of a cooperative educational program to improve prostate pathology reports among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.,"The information contained in pathology reports of radical prostatectomy specimens is critically important to treating physicians for the selection of adjuvant therapy, the evaluation of therapy, estimating prognosis, and analyzing outcomes. This information is also important to patients and their families. The first phase of this study consisted of a retrospective chart review of 554 cases of radical prostatectomy (ICD-9-CM procedure code of 60.5) in New York State for the second six-month period of 1996. This review focused on ten elements (quality indicators): submission of a frozen section, location of the adenocarcinoma, proportion of specimen involved by adenocarcinoma, perineural involvement, vascular involvement, seminal vesicle status, periprostate fat status, number of nodes submitted, status of nodes, and PIN (prostate intra-epithelial neoplasia). The second phase of this project consisted of an educational feedback program involving the directors of pathology laboratories in all hospitals in New York State. A post-intervention review of the medical charts of all male Medicare patients discharged from New York State acute care hospitals with the ICD-9-CM procedure code of 60.5 (radical prostatectomy) was conducted for the six-month period February 1 through July 31, 1999. A total of 304 charts were reviewed. Performance on the ten indicators in the first phase of the study varied from 14.8% (periprostate fat status) to 85.9% (seminal vesicle involvement). Performance for all hospitals was 50% for four quality indicators and less than 70% for seven. Post-intervention improvements in performance occurred with nine of the ten quality indicators. These improvements ranged from 1.4% (status of lymph nodes submitted) to 23.9% (proportion of specimen involved by adenocarcinoma). The results of this study demonstrate that the issues identified in the baseline with radical prostatectomy pathology reports were amenable to a cooperative educational intervention.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Aged', 'Documentation', 'Education, Medical, Continuing', 'Feedback', 'Humans', 'Laboratories, Hospital', 'Male', 'Medical Audit', 'Medical Records', 'Medicare', 'Middle Aged', 'New York', 'Pathology Department, Hospital', 'Pathology, Surgical', 'Professional Review Organizations', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Quality Indicators, Health Care']",11845938,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['L01.453.245'], ['I02.358.212.350', 'I02.358.399.250'], ['L01.906.394.211'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.420', 'N02.278.487.410', 'N04.452.442.452.422.420'], ['N04.761.700.250.500', 'N05.700.175.500'], ['E05.318.308.940.968', 'N04.452.859.564', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500', 'N06.850.520.308.940.968'], ['N03.219.521.346.506.564.663', 'N03.219.521.576.343.840', 'N03.706.615.696'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.107.567.875.075.437', 'Z01.107.567.875.350.530', 'Z01.107.567.875.500.530'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.535', 'N04.452.442.452.422.535'], ['H02.403.650.510'], ['N04.761.673', 'N05.700.675'], ['E04.950.774.860.625'], ['C04.588.945.440.770', 'C12.294.260.750', 'C12.294.565.625', 'C12.758.409.750'], ['N04.761.789', 'N05.715.760']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

It should be distinguished from occipital epilepsy of unknown aetiology (cryptogenic) given the differences in management. We reviewed patients with occipital seizures which were investigated in our epilepsy unit during the last three years. Three patients were identified with features of IPOE and genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), formerly known as idiopathic generalized epilepsy, and their clinical characteristics were analysed. We propose the term ""idiopathic generalized epilepsy with occipital semiology"" based on the significance of managing and treating this syndrome as a GGE.","['Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy, Generalized', 'Epilepsy, Reflex', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Occipital Lobe', 'Young Adult']",30361187,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['C10.228.140.490.375'], ['C10.228.140.490.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.571'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
37220,"Combined effects of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid, propionate, and acetate on milk fat yield and composition in dairy cows.","Diets inducing milk fat depression (MFD) are known to alter ruminal lipid metabolism, leading to the formation of specific isomers [such as trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)] that inhibit milk fat synthesis in lactating dairy cows. However, ruminal outflow of these isomers does not fully account for the decreases in milk fat synthesis observed during diet-induced MFD. The high-concentrate diets inducing MFD also induce a greater production of propionate, suggesting a possible inhibition of milk fat by propionate associated with trans-10,cis-12-CLA during MFD. The present experiment aimed to study the combined effects of propionate and trans-10,cis-12-CLA (both inhibitors of milk fat synthesis) on milk fat secretion and the effects of the combination of 2 nutrients with opposite effects (acetate and propionate). Six Holstein cows were used in a 6?6 Latin square design with 21-d periods (14 d of nutrient infusion). The treatments were control; ruminal infusion of 1,500 g/d of acetate (A); ruminal infusion of 800 g/d of propionate (P); duodenal infusion of 1.60 g/d of trans-10,cis-12-CLA (CLA); ruminal infusion of 750 g/d of acetate+400 g/d of propionate (A+P); and duodenal infusion of 1.60 g/d of trans-10,cis-12-CLA+ruminal infusion of 800 g/d of propionate (CLA+P). The amounts of nutrients infused were chosen to induce a similar variation in milk fat content. Treatments A and P decreased dry matter intake. Compared with the control, P and CLA treatments decreased milk fat content and yield by 9% and 15% on average. Treatment A increased milk fat content by 6.5% but did not modify milk fat yield (because of a decrease in milk yield). The effects of A and P, and CLA and P on milk fat and fatty acid percentages and yield were additive (A+P and CLA+P treatments). With a same dose of trans-10,cis-12-CLA, the additional supply of propionate induced a decrease in milk fat 40% higher than that induced by trans-10,cis-12-CLA alone. The milk fatty acid profile obtained with CLA+P was similar to those observed with high-concentrate diets inducing MFD. In conclusion, under our experimental conditions, the effects of the 3 nutrients were additive on mammary lipogenesis, regardless of their separate effects. We also show that propionate could contribute to the milk fat reductions unaccounted for by trans-10,cis-12-CLA during MFD induced by high-concentrate diets.","['Acetates', 'Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Duodenum', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Food Additives', 'Lactation', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk', 'Propionates', 'Rumen']",21426996,"[['D02.241.081.018', 'D10.251.400.045'], ['G07.203.650.161'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['D10.212.302', 'G07.203.300.375', 'J02.500.375'], ['A03.556.124.684.124', 'A03.556.875.249'], ['D10.251'], ['D27.720.372.300', 'G07.203.300.514.500', 'J02.500.514.500'], ['G08.686.523', 'G08.686.702.500'], ['D10.251.355.343.500.750'], ['A12.200.455', 'A12.790', 'G07.203.100.700', 'G07.203.300.350.525', 'J02.200.700', 'J02.500.350.525'], ['D02.241.081.751', 'D10.251.400.706'], ['A13.869.804']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
14162,Possible interaction between myxomatosis and calicivirosis related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease affecting the European rabbit.,"Serological data on myxoma virus, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) virus and RHD-like viruses in juvenile rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) trapped in 1995, 1996 and 1997 in two areas of France were analysed. For each disease, the effects of bodyweight, year, month and seropositivity for the other disease were modelled by using logistic regressions.

17570,General practice vs surgical-based follow-up for patients with colon cancer: randomised controlled trial.,"This trial examined the optimal setting for follow-up of patients after treatment for colon cancer by either general practitioners or surgeons. In all, 203 consenting patients who had undergone potentially curative treatment for colon cancer were randomised to follow-up by general practitioners or surgeons. Follow-up guidance recommended three monthly clinical review and annual faecal occult blood tests (FOBT) and were identical in both study arms. Primary outcome measures (measured at baseline, 12 and 24 months were (1) quality of life, SF-12; physical and mental component scores, (2) anxiety and depression: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and (3) patient satisfaction: Patient Visit-Specific Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes (at 24 months) were: investigations, number and timing of recurrences and deaths. In all, 170 patients were available for follow-up at 12 months and 157 at 24 months. At 12 and 24 months there were no differences in scores for quality of life (physical component score, P=0.88 at 12 months; P=0.28 at 24 months: mental component score, P=0.51, P=0.47; adjusted), anxiety (P=0.72; P=0.11) depression (P=0.28; P=0.80) or patient satisfaction (P=0.06, 24 months). General practitioners ordered more FOBTs than surgeons (rate ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-4.4), whereas more colonoscopies (rate ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0), and ultrasounds (rate ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.0) were undertaken in the surgeon-led group. Results suggest similar recurrence, time to detection and death rates in each group.

19096,Efficacy of porcine factor VIII in the management of haemophiliacs with inhibitors.,"We report our experience with polyelectrolyte-fractionated highly purified porcine factor VIII concentrate (Hyate:C). Porcine factor VIII concentrate was used to treat 14 haemorrhagic episodes including seven severe haemarthroses, three severe haematomata, two episodes of oral bleeding, one traumatic and the other after multiple dental extractions and two life-threatening intestinal haemorrhages. Altogether 60 infusions of Hyate:C were given to five haemophiliacs with inhibitors. At the time of the first infusion with porcine factor VIII the anti-human inhibitor level ranged from 60 to 2.5 modified Bethesda units/ml (MBU 4 h incubation). The porcine cross-reactivity of these inhibitors was 25.6% and 5.4% of the human inhibitor level in two patients and scarcely measurable in the other three patients. We injected an amount of porcine factor VIII concentrate corresponding to the calculated porcine neutralizing units plus the units required for haemostasis. The clinical efficacy was excellent and no adverse effects were encountered, apart from two episodes of mild pyrogenic reactions well controlled by hydrocortisone. The anamnestic antibody response against human factor VIII was of slight degree in all cases, while the porcine cross-reactivity showed no significant variation.

36009,[Viral infection and fibromyalgia].,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a very frequent syndrome of unknown cause, characterized by generalized pain, fatigue and a number of tender points to palpation. Among the several etiopathogenic hypotheses discussed, the association of FM with some viral infections has been the object of multiple studies due to its relation and similarity with the chronic fatigue syndrome, acknowledges as being related, although not exclusively, with the chronic infection by the Epstein-Barr virus. Many individual descriptions of association between infection with the human parvovirus B19 and FM led us to carry out this study, comparing the serology for that virus in 52 patients with FM and 39 healthy controls. The titers of specific IgG anti-parvovirus B19 antibodies, indicating previous infection with that virus, were determined in all 91 individuals through ELISA method and at the same laboratory. Results revealed, though not significantly, a greater prevalence of positive titers, of which the mean was also higher, in patients than in controls. When comparing the women from both groups, this tendency was even less perceptible. These data imply that there is no etiologic association between infection with the human parvovirus B19 and FM.","['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Female', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parvovirus B19, Human', 'Prospective Studies', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",7942134,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254'], ['C05.651.324', 'C05.799.321', 'C10.668.491.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['B04.280.580.650.200.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.950', 'N05.715.360.330.500.950', 'N06.850.520.450.500.950']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

The new atropine-like drug proved to be as effective a bronchodilator as isoproterenol in this study, although it had a later peak effect. Ipratropium bromide had a longer course of action than isoproterenol (4 hours compared to 1-2 hours) and was free of significant side effects.

132,Pre-operative localization of aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenomas.,"Techniques for pro-operative localization of aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenomas were studied in thirty-seven patients, each with hypertension and biochemical evidence of primary hyperaldosteronism and each later having adrenal surgery (thirty-two adenomas, five bilateral hyperplasia). Bilateral adrenal vein catheterization was attempted in all cases; it was successful on the left side in all patients and in 92% of cases on the right. Adrenal vein plasma samples were obtained from the left side in 92% and from the right in 73% of cases. Adrenal vein plasma aldosterone measurements correctly indicated the presence of tumour in twenty-eight cases but falsely predicted unilateral adenoma in two cases of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Adrenal venography also correctly predicted unilateral adrenal adenomas in twenty-six cases but falsely suggested the presence of tumour in three cases of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Computed tomography (CT) was used in the last eight cases. In seven instances the predictions (six adenomas, one bilateral adrenal hyperplasia) were confirmed at surgery. However, the remaining patient harboured an adenoma 20 mm in diameter which was not detected by CT although diagnosed both by adrenal venography and adrenal vein aldosterone measurements. Ultrasound detected adenoma in only three of twenty-two cases examined. Although further comparative studies of the type described here are required, the results of computed tomography are promising and suggest that this non-invasive technique might well become the first choice procedure in localizing aldosterone-secreting adenomas.","['Adenoma', 'Adrenal Gland Neoplasms', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aldosterone', 'Catheterization', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Ultrasonography']",7326851,"[['C04.557.470.035'], ['C04.588.322.078', 'C19.053.347', 'C19.344.078'], ['A06.300.071'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.062', 'D06.472.040.585.353.118'], ['E02.148', 'E05.157'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.444'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

8392,Tempol improves xanthine oxidoreductase-mediated vascular responses to nitrite in experimental renovascular hypertension.,"Upregulation of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) increases vascular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and contributes to nitroso-redox imbalance. However, XOR can generate nitric oxide (NO) from nitrite, and increased superoxide could inactivate NO formed from nitrite. This study tested the hypothesis that XOR contributes to the cardiovascular effects of nitrite in renovascular hypertension, and that treatment with the antioxidant tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) improves XOR-mediated effects of nitrite. Blood pressure was assessed weekly in two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) and control rats. After six weeks of hypertension, the relaxing responses to nitrite were assessed in aortic rings in the presence of the XOR inhibitor oxypurinol (or vehicle), either in the absence or in the presence of tempol. Moreover, in vivo hypotensive responses to nitrite were also examined in the presence of oxypurinol (or vehicle) and tempol (or vehicle). Aortic XOR activity and expression were evaluated by fluorescence and Western blot, respectively. Vascular ROS production was assessed by the dihydroethidium assay. 2K1C hypertensive rats showed increased aortic XOR activity and vascular ROS production compared with control rats. Oxypurinol shifted the nitrite concentration-response curve to the right in aortic rings from 2K1C rats (but not in controls). Oxypurinol also attenuated the hypotensive responses to nitrite in 2K1C rats (but not in controls). These functional findings agree with increased aortic and plasma XOR activity found in 2K1C rats. Tempol treatment enhanced oxypurinol-induced shift of the nitrite concentration-response curve to the right. However, antioxidant treatment did not affect XOR-mediated hypotensive effects of nitrite. Our results show that XOR is important to the cardiovascular responses to nitrite in 2K1C hypertension, and XOR inhibitors commonly used by patients may cancel this effect. This finding suggests that nitrite treatment may not be effective in patients being treated with XOR inhibitors. Moreover, while tempol may improve the vascular responses to nitrite, antihypertensive responses are not affected.","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Renovascular', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitrites', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Spin Labels', 'Xanthine Dehydrogenase']",27078869,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['D03.661.243'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.777.419.331.490', 'C13.351.968.419.331.490', 'C14.907.489.631.485'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D01.248.497.158.635', 'D01.625.600.600', 'D02.633'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D01.339.431', 'D01.650.775'], ['D02.389.678'], ['D08.811.682.047.892']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
11362,Metabolomic differentiation of deer antlers of various origins by 1H NMR spectrometry and principal components analysis.,"The metabolomic analysis of various types of deer antler was performed by 1H NMR spectrometry and principal components analysis (PCA). The PCA of the 1H NMR spectra of the aqueous fractions allowed a clear discrimination between antler samples according to their origins by the first three principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3), which cumulatively accounted for 93.5% of the variation in all variables. In particular, the score plots by the combination of PC1 and PC3 allowed an excellent separation of the antler samples. In addition, the major peaks in 1H NMR spectra contributing to the discrimination were assigned to lactate, alanine, acetic acid, choline, glycine, valine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. This metabolomic-analysis-based method allows various types of deer antler to be efficiently differentiated without any pre-purification steps.","['Animals', 'Antlers', 'Deer', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Protons']",16495028,"[['B01.050'], ['A13.507.288'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.373'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['D01.248.497.300.459.700', 'D01.268.406.750', 'D01.362.340.750', 'G01.249.660.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45280,Growth differentiation factor 11 locally controls anterior-posterior patterning of the axial skeleton.,"Growth and differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) is a transforming growth factor â family member that has been identified as the central player of anterior-posterior (A-P) axial skeletal patterning. Mice homozygous for Gdf11 deletion exhibit severe anterior homeotic transformations of the vertebrae and craniofacial defects. During early embryogenesis, Gdf11 is expressed predominantly in the primitive streak and tail bud regions, where new mesodermal cells arise. On the basis of this expression pattern of Gdf11 and the phenotype of Gdf11 mutant mice, it has been suggested that GDF11 acts to specify positional identity along the A-P axis either by local changes in levels of signaling as development proceeds or by acting as a morphogen. To further investigate the mechanism of action of GDF11 in the vertebral specification, we used a Cdx2-Cre transgene to generate mosaic mice in which Gdf11 expression is removed in posterior regions including the tail bud, but not in anterior regions. The skeletal analysis revealed that these mosaic mice display patterning defects limited to posterior regions where Gdf11 expression is deficient, whereas displaying normal skeletal phenotype in anterior regions where Gdf11 is normally expressed. Specifically, the mosaic mice exhibited seven true ribs, a pattern observed in wild-type (wt) mice (vs. 10 true ribs in Gdf11-/- mice), in the anterior axis and nine lumbar vertebrae, a pattern observed in Gdf11 null mice (vs. six lumbar vertebrae in wt mice), in the posterior axis. Our findings suggest that GDF11, rather than globally acting as a morphogen secreted from the tail bud, locally regulates axial vertebral patterning.","['Animals', 'Body Patterning', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth Differentiation Factors', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mosaicism', 'Osteogenesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spine']",31183862,"[['B01.050'], ['G07.345.500.100'], ['D12.644.276.954.200', 'D12.776.467.942.200', 'D23.529.942.200'], ['G05.308.310'], ['D12.644.276.954.300', 'D12.776.467.942.300', 'D23.529.942.300'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['G05.365.590.175.595'], ['G07.345.500.325.377.625.050.500.729', 'G11.427.578.050.500.729'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A02.835.232.834']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
47025,Bronchial challenge testing in occupational epidemiology: is the diluent step really necessary?,"BACKGROUND: There is no unanimous agreement on the use of a diluent step to preface methacholine challenge testing. The ""pros"" for this step are that it allows a better training of the patient; the ""cons"" are that it requires additional time and effort.OBJECTIVE: We examined if there were any systematic effects when either the baseline or postdiluent (saline) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was used to define the reactivity status.METHODS: All methacholine challenge tests performed during a 1-year period by a group of occupationally exposed workers (n = 183) were examined.RESULTS: The mean percentage change in FEV1 from baseline to postsaline was -1.44 (+/- 3.47)% and the mean absolute change was -0.043 (+/- 0.11) L (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). The maximum decrease and increase in FEV1 from baseline were -12.7% and +10.9%, respectively. Three subjects had a fall in FEV1 after saline of 10% or more and were not given methacholine. From the remaining 180 subjects, 172 were equally classified as reactors (n = 67) or nonreactors (n = 105), both by baseline FEV1 and postsaline FEV1. Eight subjects were classified as reactors by baseline FEV1 but as nonreactors by saline FEV1. In these subjects, the average FEV1 dropped 4.9% from baseline to saline and 17.3% from saline to end-test; thus, the total FEV1 drop (22.5%) exceeded the 20% required for the test to be positive. Among reactors, no relationship was found between the response to saline and the subsequent response to methacholine (r = 0.13).CONCLUSIONS: Our data did not provide evidence to support the compulsory use of a diluent step when measuring bronchial responsiveness in populations. In general, the diluent step added time and expense to the test and, on occasion, forced a greater absolute drop in FEV1 than is needed to demonstrate bronchial hyperresponsiveness.","['Adult', 'Bronchi', 'Female', 'Forced Expiratory Volume', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methacholine Chloride', 'Occupational Exposure']",12141715,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A04.411.125'], ['E01.370.386.700.660.230', 'G09.772.650.430'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.092.877.883.555.500', 'D02.675.276.534.500'], ['N06.850.460.350.600']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
1831,Dissolution behavior and in vitro evaluation of sputtered hydroxyapatite films subject to a low temperature hydrothermal treatment.,"Hydroxyapatite (HA) was coated onto titanium substrates using radio frequency sputtering. Some of the as-sputtered films were hydrothermally recrystallized at 110 degrees C. In immersion tests, the as-sputtered film completely dissolved after 2 days in a culture medium, whereas the thickness of hydrothermally treated films increased with an increase in immersion period, reaching a thickness of 127% after a period of 4 weeks. The proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells on the as-sputtered and hydrothermally treated films were investigated, and the cell morphology was also observed using scanning electron microscopy. The proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells on the as-sputtered films was suppressed, whereas proliferation on the hydrothermally treated films was comparable to that on control and titanium substrate. The suppression of cell proliferation is associated with an increase in pH of the culture medium caused by dissolution of the as-sputtered film. After a 96-h culture time, the ALP activity of the cells on the hydrothermally treated film was higher than that on the control, titanium substrate, and as-sputtered film samples. From scanning electron microscopic observations, it was found that the MC3T3-E1 cells on the hydrothermally treated films were elongated and had established more intricate filopodia networks with each other, which were also observed for MC3T3-E1 cells on the as-sputtered films after a period of 24 h.","['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coated Materials, Biocompatible', 'Crystallization', 'Durapatite', 'Hot Temperature', 'Materials Testing', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Osteoblasts', 'Prostheses and Implants', 'Surface Properties', 'Titanium']",16278871,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['D25.130.420', 'J01.637.051.130.420'], ['E05.196.300', 'G02.171'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374.075.025.300.150', 'D01.146.360.050.300.200', 'D01.578.122.477.300', 'D01.695.625.675.650.075.025.300.150'], ['G01.906.595.543', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.380', 'G16.500.750.775.710.380', 'N06.230.300.100.725.232', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.380'], ['E05.570'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['A11.329.629'], ['E07.695'], ['G02.860'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
28656,Variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism studies of reduced nitrogenase iron proteins and [4Fe-4S]+ synthetic analog clusters.,"Variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VTMCD) and EPR spectroscopies have been used to investigate the ground and excited-state properties of [4Fe-4S]+ clusters in Mo- and V-nitrogenase Fe-proteins from Azotobacter vinelandii and two synthetic analog clusters, [Fe4S4(SEt)4]3- and [Fe4S4(SC6H11)4]3-. The results indicate similar [4Fe-4S]+ clusters with analogous S = 1/2 and S = 3/2 ground states in both Fe-proteins. However, the Fe-proteins do differ in terms of the medium effects on the S = 1/2 and S = 3/2 spin mixtures in frozen solution. By utilizing medium effects in both Fe-proteins, the VTMCD characteristics of both the S = 1/2 and S = 3/2 forms of the [4Fe-4S]+ have been determined. Together with the VTMCD studies of [Fe4S4(SEt)4]3- and [Fe4S4(SC6H11)4]3-, which are shown to be predominantly S = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively, in frozen DMF/toluene solutions, the results demonstrate that the form of the VTMCD spectra provides a means of identifying and distinguishing S = 1/2 and S = 3/2 [4Fe-4S]+ clusters. Ground state zero-field splitting parameters for the S = 3/2 clusters are determined for both Fe-proteins. In addition to spin state heterogeneity, samples of the Mo-nitrogenase Fe-protein in the presence of 50% (v/v) ethylene glycol were found to exhibit heterogeneity in the S = 1/2 resonance. A rapidly relaxing axial resonance, g perpendicular = 1.94 and g parallel = 1.82, was observed in addition to the characteristic rhombic resonance, g = 2.05, 1.94 and 1.87. The origin of the heterogeneity exhibited by [4Fe-4S]+ clusters in frozen solution is discussed in light of these results.","['Circular Dichroism', 'Ethylene Glycol', 'Ethylene Glycols', 'Iron', 'Nitrogenase', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidoreductases', 'Sulfur', 'Urea']",8329442,"[['E05.196.867.151'], ['D02.033.455.250.268'], ['D02.033.455.250'], ['D01.268.556.412', 'D01.268.956.287', 'D01.552.544.412'], ['D08.811.682.647'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D08.811.682'], ['D01.268.185.900'], ['D02.065.950']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

46548,Unilateral aural atresia in childhood: case selection and rehabilitation.,"The classic management of children and adolescents with unilateral aural atresia, with or without microtia, is to assess audition, to exclude cholesteatoma formation both clinically and radiologically, to offer amplification in unilateral cases, and to consider surgical repair in bilateral cases. However, evidence indicates that children with unilateral hearing loss from any cause are at risk for delayed language development, attention deficit, and poor school performance. Favourable factors for reconstruction of hearing include a normal bone line with good word discrimination, a normal or recognizable auricle (microtia grade I or II), radiographic evidence of an air-containing middle ear cleft with an estimated volume close to the normal side, the presence of ossicles, the facial nerve running in its expected (though abnormal) course, and the absence of any syndrome affecting mid-face development or of any associated mandibular malformation. In unilateral pediatric cases, only minor auricular malformations (grades I and II) were considered for otologic repair. If microtia was more severe (grade III and IV), or if the child had any other mid-face or mandibular problem, otologic repair was delayed until these were corrected. In many cases, otologic repair was deferred throughout childhood. A summary of selection criteria, case examples, and outcomes of surgery will be presented. Carefully selected unilateral cases may be reconstructed during childhood. Unfavourable cases should be amplified or observed.","['Adolescent', 'Audiometry', 'Child', 'Congenital Abnormalities', 'Counseling', 'Ear, External', 'Female', 'Hearing Aids', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Patient Selection', 'Preoperative Care', 'Skin Transplantation']",7674443,"[['M01.060.057'], ['E01.370.382.375.060'], ['M01.060.406'], ['C16.131'], ['F02.784.176', 'F04.408.413', 'N02.421.143.303', 'N02.421.461.363'], ['A09.246.272'], ['E07.305.906.500', 'E07.814.458'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.581.500.653', 'N04.590.731'], ['E02.760.795', 'E04.604.750', 'N02.421.585.795'], ['E02.095.147.725.700', 'E04.680.275.850', 'E04.936.580.700']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
8044,[Detection of group B streptococcus in the cases died of neonatal pneumonia].,"OBJECTIVE: From the 1970s, group B streptococci (GBS) have been widely recognized as an important pathogen in neonatal infectious disease, and it emerged as the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the Western world. However, there are few data on the prevalence of neonatal GBS infections in China. The aim of this retrospective study was to estimate whether GBS is an important pathogen in severe neonatal pneumonia, and to develop a method for detection of GBS infections in fatal neonatal pneumonia.METHODS: A total of 234 neonatal cases (0 - 28 days) died in Beijing Children's Hospital from 1953 to 2004 were enrolled in this study. They were divided into two groups. Two hundred cases diagnosed as neonatal pneumonia were assigned to study group and the remaining 34 cases died of neonatal hemolysis or surgical operation without any confirmed infectious diseases were designated as control group. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissues were used as source for total genomic DNA extraction. PCR and Southern blot analyses were applied to detect GBS specific cfb gene target sequence. And the clinical data of these cases were reviewed as well.RESULTS: In the study group, 52 cases were detected positive for GBS DNA by PCR (26%), 130 cases were positive by Southern blot (65%). In the control group, 1 case was detected positive GBS DNA by PCR (3%), and 6 cases were positive by Southern blot (18%). The positive rate was significantly lower in the control group than that in the study group (PCR, chi(2) = 8.82, P < 0.01; Southern blot, chi(2) = 26.77, P < 0.01). The positive rate in the neonates younger than 7 days (early-onset) was significantly higher than that in neonates older than 7 days (late-onset) (PCR: 37% vs. 13%, chi(2) = 15.537, P < 0.01; Southern blot: 72% vs. 52%, chi(2) = 4.37, P < 0.05). In the positive early-onset cases, 39% of whom were born prematurely (29/74). Out of the 200 cases, 75 had complete clinical data. Neither blood nor lung culture for GBS was performed in any of these cases. But risk factors were identified for 35 cases, such as premature delivery, low birth weight, premature rupture of the membrane and abnormal amniotic fluid. GBS was positive in all these cases. Severe apnea appeared to be a common symptom and was present in most of the early-onset GBS-positive cases, while cough and wheezing were found in most of the late-onset GBS-positive cases. In the control group, one PCR positive case was suffered from malignant teratoma. The other 5 positive cases confirmed by Southern blot were diagnosed as kernicterus, hepatoma, aproctia complicating with cysti-urethral fistula, neonatal physio logical bleeding and aproctia complicated with archo-perineal fistula.CONCLUSION: Group B Streptococcus is an important pathogen in fatal neonatal pneumonia, especially in early-onset cases. southern blot may be a sensitive method to detect GBS infection in archival tissues. In the clinical work, more attention should be paid to the neonates with GBS risk factors. And GBS detection and prevention in neonates should be put into clinical practice.","['China', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Pneumonia, Staphylococcal', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Streptococcus agalactiae']",17274877,"[['Z01.252.474.164'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['C01.150.252.410.868.675', 'C01.150.252.620.620', 'C01.748.610.540.620', 'C08.381.677.540.620', 'C08.730.610.540.620'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['B03.353.750.737.872.100', 'B03.510.400.800.872.100', 'B03.510.550.737.872.100']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

(Lepidoptera, Limantriidae) upon chronic exposure to benzo(a)pyrene.","The effects of different concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) (2, 10, 20, 100, 200, and 2000 ng/g dry food weight) on the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and concentration of heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) in fifth instar Lymantria dispar brain tissue were investigated. Inhibition of AChE is a general effect biomarker at the individual level. We observed the most efficient inhibition of this enzyme at medium and high BaP concentrations (20, 100, 200, and 2000 ng/g dry food weight). Western blot analysis revealed the presence of two hsp 70 isoforms, with changed amounts depending on the BaP concentration. A fluctuating response in hsp70 concentration to ingested BaP was observed: with decreased levels in the groups fed 2 and 100 ng BaP/g dry food weight, but increased concentrations in the groups given 10 and 2000 ng/g dry food weight. Even though we detected changes in AChE activity and hsp70 concentration in L. dispar brain tissue upon exposure to different BaP concentrations, we cannot characterize them as sensitive and reliable biomarkers for this xenobiotic in L. dispar caterpillars.","['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Animals', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Carcinogens', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Biomarkers', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Insect Proteins', 'Larva', 'Moths', 'Mutagens']",28795330,"[['D08.811.277.352.100.170.176'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.799.306.300', 'D04.615.799.306.300'], ['D27.888.569.100'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D23.101.258', 'G16.505', 'N06.850.460.350.080.250'], ['D27.888.284'], ['D12.776.580.216.375'], ['D12.776.093.500'], ['B05.500.500', 'G07.345.500.550.500.500'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.937.650'], ['D27.888.569.468']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

22044,Whole blood versus plasma measurements of glutamate and alanine across the human myocardium.,"Comparison of whole blood and plasma aorto-coronary sinus concentration differences of glutamate and alanine were made before, during and after coronary sinus pacing in seven patients with normal and six patients with stenotic coronary arteries. Mean differences between duplicate analyses were greater in whole blood than plasma both of glutamate (7.5 +/- 5.8 vs. 3.3 +/- 3.0 mumol/l, p less than 0.001) and of alanine (7.9 +/- 7.0 vs. 3.8 +/- 3.4 mumol/l, p less than 0.001). Concentrations of glutamate were 3.4 and of alanine 1.4 times higher in whole blood than in plasma. Blood cells were calculated to be responsible for about 20% of glutamate and alanine blood exchanges across the heart. Plasma and whole blood fluxes were closely positively correlated (glutamate:r = 0.81, alanine:r = 0.88) and had always the same direction. Differences in myocardial exchanges of amino acids between the patients with and without coronary artery disease, as well as rapid changes during pacing, could be demonstrated in plasma analyses but were not significantly reflected in whole blood glutamate determinations. This seemed to be due to the greater variations in whole blood analysis. In conclusion, differences in aorto-coronary sinus plasma concentrations reflected, although underestimated, whole blood fluxes. Because of considerable gains in precision of analysis, plasma should be preferred to whole blood for evaluations of glutamate and alanine exchanges across the human heart.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alanine', 'Blood', 'Cardiac Pacing, Artificial', 'Coronary Disease', 'Female', 'Glutamates', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardium', 'Plasma', 'Sinus of Valsalva']",3589494,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D12.125.042'], ['A12.207.152', 'A15.145'], ['E02.331.200'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['D12.125.067.625', 'D12.125.119.409'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['A12.207.152.693', 'A12.207.270.695', 'A15.145.693'], ['A07.015.114.056.847']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
27663,The per-protocol effect of immediate versus deferred antiretroviral therapy initiation.,"OBJECTIVE: The Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) trial found a lower risk of a composite clinical outcome in HIV-positive individuals assigned to immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared with those assigned to deferred initiation. However, 30% of those assigned to deferred initiation started ART earlier than the protocol specified. To supplement the published intention-to-treat (ITT) effect estimates, here we estimate the per-protocol effect of immediate versus deferred ART initiation in START.DESIGN: The START trial randomized 4685 HIV-positive participants with CD4 cell counts more than 500 cells/ìl to start ART immediately after randomization (immediate initiation group) or to wait until the CD4 cell count dropped below 350 cells/ìl or an AIDS diagnosis (deferred initiation group).METHODS: We used the parametric g-formula to estimate and compare the cumulative 5-year risk of the composite clinical outcome in the immediate initiation group, and deferred initiation groups had all the trial participants adhered to the protocol.RESULTS: We estimated that the 5-year risk of the composite outcome would have been 3.2% under immediate ART initiation and 7.0% under deferred initiation. The difference of 3.8% (95% confidence interval 1.5, 6.5) was larger than the ITT effect estimate of 3.1%, corresponding to a difference in effect estimates of 0.72% (-0.35, 2.35).CONCLUSION: The ITT effect estimate may underestimate the benefit of immediate ART initiation by 23%. This estimate can be used by patients and policy-makers who need to understand the full extent of the benefit of changes in ART initiation policies.","['Adult', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",27782964,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.122.388.077'], ['E02.319.310.075'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
46571,Relative fitness can decrease in evolving asexual populations of S. cerevisiae.,"It is generally accepted from the darwinian theory of evolution that a progressive increase in population adaptation will occur in populations containing genetic variation in fitness, until a stable equilibrium is reached and/or the additive genetic variation is exhausted. However, the theoretical literature of population genetics documents exceptions where mean population fitness may decrease in response to evolutionary changes in gene frequency, due to varying selective coefficients, sexual selection or to epistatic interactions between loci. Until now, no examples of such exceptions have been documented from fitness estimates in either natural or experimental populations. We present here direct evidence that, as a result of epistatic interactions between adaptive mutations, mean population fitness can decrease in asexual evolving populations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","['Biological Evolution', 'Diploidy', 'Epistasis, Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Haploidy', 'Mutation', 'Reproduction, Asexual', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae']",16752492,"[['G05.045', 'G16.075'], ['G05.700.264'], ['G05.308.207'], ['G05.365'], ['G05.380'], ['G05.700.456'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G08.686.784.830'], ['B01.300.107.795.785.800', 'B01.300.930.705.655']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Between 1976 and 1989, 1 surgeon at our institution performed 110 TKAs in 90 patients who were 80 years of age or older. No patients were lost to follow-up monitoring; all living patients underwent a minimum of 10 years (range, 10-19 years) followup care. There were 5 (3.4%) surgical complications, but at final follow-up examination, no implants had failed because of aseptic loosening. Of all patients, 96% experienced complete pain relief and 91% showed an excellent knee score (> or = 85) at final follow-up examination. Only 14% of patients had an excellent function score. The 88% death rate for our patient population, the fact that only 14% of patients had an excellent function score after surgery, and the lack of aseptic implant failure by the time of final follow-up examination after an average of 8 years with a conventional TKA raise the question of whether using expensive newer-design implants cost-effectiveness is in octogenarians.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Knee Joint', 'Knee Prosthesis', 'Male', 'Osteoarthritis, Knee', 'Pain Measurement', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Recovery of Function', 'Survival Analysis']",12728420,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E04.555.110.110.115', 'E04.650.110.115', 'E04.680.101.110.115'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.583.475'], ['E07.695.400.410'], ['C05.550.114.606.500', 'C05.799.613.500'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['C23.550.767'], ['G16.757'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
30624,Distribution of sickle cell disease and assessment of risk factors based on transcranial Doppler values in the Gulf region.,"Background/Objective: Stroke is a potentially fatal complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is useful at identifying increased risk of stroke in children with SCD and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The main aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with SCD in the Gulf region who are at a high risk of stroke, as determined by TCD.Methods: This multicenter (Oman, Qatar, and UAE), descriptive, cross-sectional study in patients (aged 2-16 years) with SCD included a baseline visit, 1 follow-up visit for patients with conditional TCD, and 3-year retrospective data analysis for all patients.Results: Of the 410 eligible patients (Oman, 86.5%; Qatar, 8.2%; UAE, 5.1%), most had a TCD finding (left side, 91.7%; right side, 92.0%) of normal velocity (<155 cm/s) at baseline. For 6 of 7 patients with conditional velocity (155-179 cm/s) and 1 patient with high velocity (?180 cm/s), baseline TCD results were not confirmed at follow-up. As per bivariate linear regression, age, race, transfusion type, and transfusion frequency were significant predictors of the TCD velocities. Multivariate logistic regressions revealed that TCD velocities were significantly correlated with sex, race, and type of transfusion. No patients reported any adverse events at follow-up. No deaths occurred during the study.Discussion/Conclusions: The study results show that far fewer patients with SCD in the Gulf have abnormal TCD findings than the internationally reported. Larger studies are needed to identify the factors underlying this observation.","['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oman', 'Qatar', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial', 'United Arab Emirates']",31983291,"[['M01.060.057'], ['C15.378.071.141.150.150', 'C15.378.420.155', 'C16.320.070.150', 'C16.320.365.155'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.500.600'], ['Z01.252.245.500.690'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E01.370.350.578.937.260.850', 'E01.370.350.700.560.260.850', 'E01.370.350.850.260.850', 'E01.370.350.850.850.870', 'E01.370.376.537.750.260.850', 'E05.629.937.260.850'], ['Z01.252.245.500.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
11280,Physiological levels of hydrostatic pressure alter morphology and organization of cytoskeletal and adhesion proteins in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells.,"The response of human MG-63 osteosarcoma cells to physiological levels of hydrostatic pressure was studied. Cell cultures were subjected to a 20-min, 4-MPa hydrostatic pressure pulse. Adhesion was measured at 20 min and 2 h post-hydrostatic pressure. Morphometric measurements of cell shape and immunofluorescent assays of cytoskeletal and adhesion proteins were done pre- and post-hydrostatic pressure. Pressure-treated cells showed increased adhesion (resistance to deadhesion by trypsinization)-with increased recovery time. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated increased heterotypic adhesion receptor at cell-cell interfaces and increased alpha 3, beta 1-integrin at cell-substrate interfaces. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated depolymerization of alpha-tubulin, vimentin, and actin during the pressure pulse. Actin reorganization was slower than that of alpha-tubulin and vimentin, with stress filaments not well organized even after 1 h postpressure. The depolymerization of alpha-tubulin, vimentin, and actin observed at relatively low levels of hydrostatic pressure suggests disintegration of the integrin-cytoskeletal attachment complex. The increased resistance of the cells to trypsinization and the increase in both heterotypic adhesion receptor and the alpha 3, beta 1-integrin at cell interfaces suggest that cells compensate for loss of cytoskeletal integrity by increasing attachment to both adjacent cells and the extracellular matrix.","['Bone and Bones', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Hydrostatic Pressure', 'Integrins', 'Morphogenesis', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",8329174,"[['A02.835.232', 'A10.165.265'], ['G04.022'], ['D12.776.395.550.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200', 'D23.050.301.350'], ['G04.346'], ['D12.776.220'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512.240', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512.240', 'E05.200.500.607.512.240', 'E05.200.750.551.512.240', 'E05.478.583.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.715.352'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.408'], ['G07.345.500'], ['C04.557.450.565.575.650', 'C04.557.450.795.620'], ['G01.910.857'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A simple and workable, adjustable antireflection device was built that can be easily adapted to photographic slit lamps, a common instrument in ophthalmology equipment. The slit lamp is a versatile tool for photographing structures in the anterior segment of the eye, particularly the lens. Corneal reflections are eliminated for angles between the light band and a photograph plane ranging from 20 degrees to 90 degrees, with the light band no greater than 0.5 mm and the corneal curvature about 7.6 to 7.9 mm. The device acts by blocking aberrant light rays from the light source that would otherwise be reflected by the mirrorlike surface of the cornea and enter the objective lens.

Women were placed into seven groups according to which clinical risk factor they had (women could be placed in more than one group): (1) atraumatic fracture since the age of 25 years, (2) report of X-ray osteopenia, (3) predisposing medical condition or use of therapy known to affect bone metabolism, (4) premature menopause before the age of 45 years or a history of amenorrhea of longer than 6 months' duration, (5) family history of osteoporosis, (6) body mass index (BMI) <20 kg/m(2), and (7) current smoking habit. Forearm BMD was measured using an Osteometer DTX-200 peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner, and spine and hip BMD measurements were obtained on a Hologic QDR-4500 scanner. Manufacturers' reference ranges were used to calculate Z scores for the spine and forearm, and the NHANES III reference range was used to calculate Z scores for the hip. Multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate the mean decrease in Z score associated with each clinical risk factor. The Z-score reductions associated with the seven risk factors were similar for forearm and central BMD measurements. For forearm measurements, Z-score decreases associated with a history of atraumatic fracture (-0.25), a medical condition or therapy known to affect bone metabolism (-0.26), premature menopause or history of amenorrhea (-0.30), and BMI <20 kg/m(2) (-0.82) were all statistically significantly different from zero (P < 0.05). With an increasing number of risk factors in each individual, the mean Z score at each measurement site became progressively more negative. In conclusion, clinical risk factors for low BMD affect forearm BMD measurements to a similar extent as central BMD.","['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic', 'Female', 'Forearm', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal', 'Prevalence', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Spine']",17308990,"[['E01.370.350.700.024', 'E05.196.712.224.187'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G11.427.100'], ['C05.116.198', 'C18.452.104'], ['A01.378.800.585'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05.116.198.579.610', 'C18.452.104.579.610'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.581.500', 'H01.770.644.728'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['A02.835.232.834']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
29450,Probable walnut-induced anaphylactic reaction in a dog.,"BACKGROUND: Anaphylaxis due to nuts is frequent in humans; to the best of the authors' knowledge, it has not been reported previously in dogs.CASE REPORT: A 5-year-old female, intact, Vizsla dog was presented with acute diarrhoea, vomiting, respiratory distress and erythematous wheals. The dog had eaten walnuts, which she had been fed in small amounts for years, hours before the onset of clinical signs. A diagnosis of generalized anaphylaxis was made. Skin testing and Western blotting revealed positive results with walnuts and hazelnuts.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This case report illustrates the need for a thorough food history and for recognition that a dog may experience severe allergic reactions to unusual and regularly fed food items. It also shows that allergen specific tests may help to confirm the diagnosis and help in planning the dog's future dietary regime.","['Anaphylaxis', 'Animals', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Juglans', 'Prednisolone']",28261916,"[['C20.543.480.099'], ['B01.050'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['D06.472.040.543', 'D27.505.696.399.472.488'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.750.500.500'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.769.795']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25074,Physical deposition improved SERS stability of morphology controlled periodic micro/nanostructured arrays based on colloidal templates.,"An effective and inexpensive method is developed to fabricate periodic arrays by sacrificial colloidal monolayer template route by chemical deposition and further physical deposition. By a colloidal template induced precursor solution dipping strategy, different periodic arrays of semi-hollow sphere array, inverse opal with monolayer pore arrays and hole arrays are obtained under different conditions. After magnetron sputtering deposition, their morphologies are changed to novel micro/nanostructured arrays of honeycomb-shaped arrays, hollow cavity arrays, and regular network arrays due to multiple direction deposition of sputtering deposition and shadow effect. After coating a gold thin layer, these periodic micro/nanostructured arrays are used as SERS active substrates and demonstrate a very stable SERS performance compared with periodic arrays achieved by direct colloidal template-induced chemical deposition. Additionally, a honeycomb-shaped array displays better SERS enhancement than that of a hollow cavity array or a regular network array. After optimization of honeycomb-shaped arrays with different periodicities, an array with periodicity of 350 nm demonstrates much stronger SERS enhancement and possesses a low detection limit of 10(-11) M R6G. Such stable SERS performance is useful for practical application in portable Raman detecting devices to detect organic molecules.","['Colloids', 'Gold', 'Magnetic Phenomena', 'Nanostructures', 'Periodicity', 'Physical Phenomena', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",25356821,"[['D20.280', 'D26.255.165'], ['D01.268.556.322', 'D01.268.956.186', 'D01.552.544.322'], ['G01.358'], ['J01.637.512'], ['G01.910.645', 'G07.180.562'], ['G01'], ['E05.196.867.800', 'E05.799.830'], ['E05.196.822.860', 'E05.196.867.890'], ['E05.196.309.742', 'E05.196.822.950', 'G01.867.950', 'G02.965']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
12390,Case 253: Thrombosed Umbilical Venous Varix in an Infant.,"History A 3-month-old previously healthy girl presented to an outside institution with a 4-day history of low-grade fever, irritability, and a tender ""knot"" in the upper abdomen. Ultrasonography (US) was performed at an outside hospital. US images were not available for review; however, they showed a mass in the left hepatic lobe, per the outside report, and the patient was referred to our institution for further evaluation. Her parents reported a normal full-term pregnancy, with regular prenatal care and normal prenatal US findings. The baby was born after an uncomplicated gestation. She was delivered at term via an uncomplicated cesarean section due to a maternal history of cesarean section. The perinatal course was uncomplicated, and there was no history of umbilical catheterization, per the parents. On arrival at our institution, the patient had a temperature of 38.2°C. All other vital signs were normal. Palpation revealed a tender and firm mass in the periumbilical region; otherwise, physical examination findings were normal. Results of laboratory work-up were normal, except for elevated white blood cell count (26 600/mm3 [26.6 ? 109/L]; normal, 6000-17 500/mm3 [6-17.5 ? 109/L]). The patient underwent US followed by intravenous contrast material-enhanced (10 mL ioversol, Optiray 320; Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) computed tomography (CT) on the same day.","['Amoxicillin', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler', 'Umbilical Veins', 'Varicose Veins', 'Venous Thrombosis']",29668410,"[['D02.065.589.099.750.750.050.050', 'D02.886.108.750.750.050.050', 'D03.633.100.300.750.750.050.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['C23.888.119.344'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.350.850.850'], ['A07.015.908.670.874', 'A16.378.693.807'], ['C14.907.927'], ['C14.907.355.830.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
20390,Viral infection switches non-plasmacytoid dendritic cells into high interferon producers.,"Type I interferons (IFN-I) are important cytokines linking innate and adaptive immunity. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells make high levels of IFN-I in response to viral infection and are thought to be the major source of the cytokines in vivo. Here, we show that conventional non-plasmacytoid dendritic cells taken from mice infected with a dendritic-cell-tropic strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus make similarly high levels of IFN-I on subsequent culture. Similarly, non-plasmacytoid dendritic cells secrete high levels of IFN-I in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a major viral signature, when the latter is introduced into the cytoplasm to mimic direct viral infection. This response is partially dependent on the cytosolic dsRNA-binding enzyme protein kinase R and does not require signalling through toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, a surface receptor for dsRNA. Furthermore, we show that sequestration of dsRNA by viral NS1 (refs 6, 7) explains the inability of conventional dendritic cells to produce IFN-I on infection with influenza. Our results suggest that multiple dendritic cell types, not just plasmacytoid cells, can act as specialized interferon-producing cells in certain viral infections, and reveal the existence of a TLR-independent pathway for dendritic cell activation that can be the target of viral interference.","['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CpG Islands', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Double-Stranded', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 3', 'Toll-Like Receptors', 'eIF-2 Kinase']",12819664,"[['A11.251.210.100', 'A11.329.228.100'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080.380.160', 'G05.360.080.380.160', 'G05.360.340.024.159'], ['A11.066.270', 'A11.436.270', 'A15.382.066.270', 'A15.382.670.260'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890', 'D23.529.374.440.890'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.250', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.250', 'D23.529.374.440.890.250'], ['C01.207.245.500.500', 'C01.925.182.550.500', 'C01.925.782.082.580', 'C10.228.228.245.500.500', 'C10.228.614.400.500'], ['B04.820.480.500.070.100.550'], ['D12.776.395.550', 'D12.776.543.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['D13.444.735.490', 'G02.111.570.820.486.775', 'G05.360.580.775'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.910.500.300'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.910.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.300', 'D12.644.360.275', 'D12.776.476.275']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27230,"Where patients with cancer die in South Australia, 1990-1999: a population-based review.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the place of death of South Australians who die of cancer.DESIGN: A population-based, cross-sectional study of data from the South Australian Cancer Registry.PARTICIPANTS: 29,230 patients with cancer dying in 1990-1999.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Place of death; patient demography; year of death; survival from diagnosis; and type of cancer.RESULTS: 25.0% of patients died in a metropolitan public hospital, 19.9% in a hospice, 16.9% in a country hospital, 15.8% at a private residence, 12.7% in a metropolitan private hospital, and 9.7% in a nursing home. Although the change in place of death was not marked, multivariate logistic regression showed a secular trend away from metropolitan public hospitals towards metropolitan private hospitals and, in 1998-1999, towards nursing homes. Patients dying of cancer in a metropolitan public hospital were more likely to be younger, males, born outside Australia, and residents of lower socioeconomic areas of Adelaide. They were also more likely to have died within three months of diagnosis, and to have a haematological malignancy or a cancer of the upper digestive tract, lung or female breast. In contrast, patients dying at a private residence tended to be under 70 years and comprise longer-term survivors. Country residents were less likely than Adelaide residents to die in a hospice.CONCLUSION: The proportion of patients dying in different settings have health service implications. The relatively low use of hospice facilities by country patients may reflect differences in access to hospice facilities.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Facilities', 'Home Nursing', 'Hospices', 'Hospitals, Rural', 'Hospitals, Urban', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms', 'Nursing Homes', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'South Australia', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Terminal Care']",11795541,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['N02.278'], ['E02.760.611.470', 'N02.421.143.524.470', 'N02.421.533.320'], ['N02.278.421.556.185', 'N02.421.143.550'], ['N02.278.421.518'], ['N02.278.421.660'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04'], ['N02.278.825.610'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['Z01.639.100.968', 'Z01.678.100.373.968'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['E02.760.905', 'N02.421.585.905']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

Lectin agglutination studies revealed that there is an up-regulation of terminally exposed galactose residues on the noninfective promastigotes. The enzyme galactosyl transferase was absent in the infective form but present in the non-infective form of the parasites. An association between galactosylation and loss of infectivity was also observed.

41605,Fulminant hepatitis after grand mal seizures: mechanisms and role of liver transplantation.,"Fulminant liver failure is a rare complication of grand mal seizures with a high mortality, the prognosis being largely determined by the combination of the hepatic and neurologic insults. The mechanisms of acute liver failure secondary to grand mal epilepsy and the place of liver transplantation in this context are poorly defined and are the subject of this report. A series of 6 such patients is presented. All had a history of chronic primary or post-traumatic epilepsy and presented with acute liver failure shortly after a grand mal fit. Detailed accounts of background, presentation, and management are given and integrated with blood, radiologic, and histologic investigations. Two of the 6 patients survived, 1 making a full recovery and the other with neurologic sequelae. Two patients underwent liver transplantation but died with severe neurologic sequelae despite improving liver function. The remaining 2 patients were considered too ill to undergo liver transplantation and died in multiple organ failure. Liver histology from needle biopsy and/or native liver explants identified lesions compatible with a combination of steatosis and necrosis. Factor V and transaminase levels may allow early identification of patients in whom liver function is likely to improve spontaneously. In conclusion, the mechanisms of liver failure occurring after grand mal seizures appear multifactorial, including hypoxia, steatosis, and drug-induced components. The neurological prognosis and overall survival of these patients remains poor.","['Adult', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic', 'Fatty Liver', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia', 'Liver Failure', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Selection', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",12883489,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C06.552.100', 'C25.100.562', 'C25.723.260'], ['C10.228.140.490.375.290'], ['C06.552.241'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.852.079'], ['C06.552.308.500'], ['E02.095.147.725.490', 'E04.210.650', 'E04.936.450.490', 'E04.936.580.490'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.581.500.653', 'N04.590.731'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

42933,AS03-Adjuvanted H5N1 Avian Influenza Vaccine Modulates Early Innate Immune Signatures in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells.,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant System 03 (AS03) markedly enhances responses to influenza A/H5N1 vaccines, but the mechanisms of this enhancement are incompletely understood.METHODS: Using ribonucleic acid sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AS03-adjuvanted and unadjuvanted inactivated H5N1 vaccine recipients, we identified differentially expressed genes, enriched pathways, and genes that correlated with serologic responses. We compared bulk PBMC findings with our previously published assessments of flow-sorted immune cell types.RESULTS: AS03-adjuvanted vaccine induced the strongest differential signals on day 1 postvaccination, activating multiple innate immune pathways including interferon and JAK-STAT signaling, Fcã receptor (FcãR)-mediated phagocytosis, and antigen processing and presentation. Changes in signal transduction and immunoglobulin genes predicted peak hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titers. Compared with individual immune cell types, activated PBMC genes and pathways were most similar to innate immune cells. However, several pathways were unique to PBMCs, and several pathways identified in individual cell types were absent in PBMCs.CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs after AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccination revealed early activation of innate immune signaling, including a 5- to 8-fold upregulation of FcãR1A/1B/1C genes. Several early gene responses were correlated with HAI titer, indicating links with the adaptive immune response. Although PBMCs and cell-specific results shared key innate immune signals, unique signals were identified by both approaches.","['Adaptive Immunity', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Adult', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Combinations', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype', 'Influenza Vaccines', 'Influenza, Human', 'Leukocytes', 'Polysorbates', 'Signal Transduction', 'Squalene', 'Young Adult', 'alpha-Tocopherol']",30566602,"[['G12.450.050'], ['D27.505.696.477.067'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['D26.310'], ['E05.393.332'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G12.450.564'], ['B04.820.480.968.405.400.500'], ['D20.215.894.899.302'], ['C01.748.310', 'C01.925.782.620.365', 'C08.730.310'], ['A11.118.637', 'A15.145.229.637', 'A15.382.490'], ['D02.033.455.250.700.690', 'D05.750.741.700', 'D25.720.741.700', 'J01.637.051.720.741.700'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.806', 'D02.455.849.919.681'], ['M01.060.116.815'], ['D03.383.663.283.909.750.249', 'D03.633.100.150.909.750.249']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
38262,Human Bitter Taste Receptors Are Activated by Different Classes of Polyphenols.,"Polyphenols may contribute directly to plant-based foodstuffs flavor, in particular to astringency and bitterness. In this work, the bitterness of a small library of polyphenols from different classes [procyanidin dimers type B, ellagitannins (punicalagin, castalagin, and vescalagin) and phenolic acid ethyl esters (protocatechuic, ferulic, and vanillic acid ethyl esters] was studied by a cell-based assay. The bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) activated by these polyphenols and the half-maximum effective concentrations (EC50) of each agonist-TAS2Rs pair were determined. Computational methodologies were used to understand the polyphenol molecular region responsible for receptor activation and to get insights into the type of bonds established in the agonist-TAS2Rs pairs. The results show the combinatorial pattern of TAS2Rs activation. TAS2R5 seems to be the only receptor exhibiting a bias toward the activation by condensed tannins, while TAS2R7 seems more tuned for hydrolyzable (ellagi)tannins. Additionally, at the concentrations usually found for these compounds in foodstuffs, they can actively contribute to bitter taste, especially ellagitannins.","['Biflavonoids', 'Catechin', 'Cell Line', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Humans', 'Hydrolyzable Tannins', 'Polyphenols', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Taste']",30056706,"[['D03.383.663.283.266.450.190', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.190'], ['D03.383.663.283.240.190', 'D03.383.663.283.266.450.206', 'D03.633.100.150.240.190', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.206'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D26.650.294', 'D27.720.372.300.353', 'D27.720.744.294', 'G07.203.300.514.500.400', 'J02.500.514.500.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.241.223.100.300.200.299', 'D02.241.511.390.200.299', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.281.200.299', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.200.299', 'D05.750.078.937.214'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.715', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.260.777'], ['D03.383.663.283.266.450.700', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.700', 'D05.750.078.937.429'], ['D12.776.543.750.695'], ['F02.830.816.724', 'G11.561.790.724']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
29315,Synthesis and evaluation of thymidine kinase 1-targeting carboranyl pyrimidine nucleoside analogs for boron neutron capture therapy of cancer.,"A library of sixteen 2nd generation amino- and amido-substituted carboranyl pyrimidine nucleoside analogs, designed as substrates and inhibitors of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) for potential use in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) of cancer, was synthesized and evaluated in enzyme kinetic-, enzyme inhibition-, metabolomic-, and biodistribution studies. One of these 2nd generation carboranyl pyrimidine nucleoside analogs (YB18A [3]), having an amino group directly attached to a meta-carborane cage tethered via ethylene spacer to the 3-position of thymidine, was approximately 3-4 times superior as a substrate and inhibitor of hTK1 than N5-2OH (2), a 1st generation carboranyl pyrimidine nucleoside analog. Both 2 and 3 appeared to be 5'-monophosphorylated in TK1(+) RG2 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Biodistribution studies in rats bearing intracerebral RG2 glioma resulted in selective tumor uptake of 3 with an intratumoral concentration that was approximately 4 times higher than that of 2. The obtained results significantly advance the understanding of the binding interactions between TK1 and carboranyl pyrimidine nucleoside analogs and will profoundly impact future design strategies for these agents.","['Animals', 'Boron Compounds', 'Boron Neutron Capture Therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glioma', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides', 'Rats', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidine Kinase']",26087030,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.132', 'D02.203'], ['E02.815.722.500.100'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.388', 'E05.200.500.388', 'E05.242.417', 'E05.337.550.200'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.380', 'C04.557.470.670.380', 'C04.557.580.625.600.380'], ['G02.111.570', 'G02.466'], ['D27.505.519.389.755'], ['D03.383.742.680', 'D13.570.685'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5773,An optically coupled sensor for the measurement of currents induced by MRI gradient fields into endocardial leads.,"OBJECT: The gradient fields generated during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures have the potential to induce electrical current on implanted endocardial leads. Whether this current can result in undesired cardiac stimulation is unknown.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This paper provides a detailed description of how to construct an optically coupled sensor for the measurement of gradient-field-induced currents into endocardial leads. The system is based on a microcontroller that works as analog-to-digital converter and sends the current signal acquired from the lead to an optical high-speed, light-emitting diode transmitter. A plastic fiber guides the light outside the MRI chamber to a photodiode receiver and then to an acquisition board connected to a PC laptop.RESULTS: The performance of the system has been characterized in terms of power consumption (8 mA on average), sampling frequency (20.5 kHz), measurement range (-12.8 to 10.3 mA) and resolution (22.6 µA). Results inside a 3 T MRI scanner are also presented.CONCLUSIONS: The detailed description of the current sensor could permit more standardized study of MRI gradient current induction in pacemaker systems. Results show the potential of gradient currents to affect the pacemaker capability of triggering a heartbeat, by modifying the overall energy delivered by the stimulator.","['Electrodes, Implanted', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Endocardium', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Optical Devices', 'Pacemaker, Artificial', 'Radiometry', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transducers']",25304063,"[['E07.305.250.319', 'E07.695.202'], ['G01.358.500.260', 'G01.358.750.500'], ['A07.541.207'], ['E05.320'], ['E05.325.192'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['E07.632'], ['E07.305.250.750'], ['E05.799'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E07.305.812']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
43781,Activation of GABA(A) receptors in the accessory olfactory bulb does not prevent the formation of an olfactory memory in mice.,"When female mice are mated, they form a memory to the pheromonal signal of their male partner. The neural mechanisms underlying this memory involve changes at the reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses between glutamatergic mitral cells and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic granule cells in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Blockade of GABA(A) receptors in the AOB leads to the formation of an olfactory memory. In an attempt to disrupt memory formation at mating, we used local infusions of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol into the AOB during the critical period for memory formation. Muscimol across a wide range of doses (1-1000 pmol) did not prevent memory formation. The resistance of this memory to GABA(A) receptor activation may reflect the complexity of synaptic microcircuits in the AOB.","['Animals', 'Female', 'GABA Agonists', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Muscimol', 'Olfactory Bulb', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, GABA-A', 'Sex Attractants']",11503910,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.625.240.200', 'D27.505.696.577.240.200'], ['F02.463.425.540'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.440', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.440'], ['D03.383.129.462.470', 'D23.946.587.587'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.388'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.175.562', 'D12.776.157.530.400.400.100.100', 'D12.776.543.550.450.175.562', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.100.100', 'D12.776.543.585.400.175.562', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.100.100', 'D12.776.543.750.130.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.300.300'], ['D23.641.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
40893,A Comparison of the ATP Generating Pathways Used by S. Typhimurium to Fuel Replication within Human and Murine Macrophage and Epithelial Cell Lines.,"The metabolism of S. Typhimurium within infected host cells plays a fundamental role in virulence since it enables intracellular proliferation and dissemination and affects the innate immune response. An essential requirement for the intracellular replication of S. Typhimurium is the need to regenerate ATP. The metabolic route used to fulfil this requirement is the subject of the present study. For infection models we used human and murine epithelial and macrophage cell lines. The epithelial cell lines were mICc12, a transimmortalised murine colon enterocyte cell line that shows many of the characteristics of a primary epithelial cell line, and HeLa cells. The model macrophage cell lines were THP-1A human monocyte/macrophages and RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. Using a mutational approach combined with an exometabolomic analysis, we showed that neither fermentative metabolism nor anaerobic respiration play major roles in energy generation in any of the cell lines studied. Rather, we identified overflow metabolism to acetate and lactate as the foremost route by which S. Typhimurium fulfils its energy requirements.","['Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Glycolysis', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Macrophages', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Metabolomics', 'Mice', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Ubiquinone']",26930214,"[['D03.633.100.759.646.138.236', 'D13.695.667.138.236', 'D13.695.827.068.236'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G02.111.158.750', 'G03.191.750', 'G03.295.436', 'G03.493.360'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['G03.493'], ['H01.158.201.586', 'H01.158.273.180.599', 'H01.181.122.638'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B03.440.450.425.800.200.825', 'B03.660.250.150.710.160.760'], ['D02.806.250.900', 'D08.211.935']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
13923,Interdependence between the aerobic degradation of BPA and readily biodegradable substrates by activated sludge in semi-continuous reactors.,"The objective of the present work was to analyze the interrelationship between the aerobic degradation of BPA and readily biodegradable substrates by activated sludge (AS) in semi-continuous reactors (SCRs). AS were obtained from three SCRs fed with glucose, acetate or peptone. AS from these reactors were used as inocula for three SCRs that were fed with each biogenic substrate, and for three SCRs that were fed with the biogenic substrate and BPA. In all cases, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), BPA, total suspended solids (TSS) and respirometric measurements were performed. Although BPA could be removed in the presence of all the tested substrates, AS grown on acetate exhibited the longest acclimation to BPA. Reactors fed with peptone attained the lowest TSS concentration; however, these AS had the highest specific BPA degradation rate. Specific DOC removal rates and respirometric measurements demonstrated that the presence of BPA had a negligible effect on the removal of the tested substrates. A mathematical model was developed to represent the evolution of TSS and DOC in the SCRs as a function of the operation cycle. Results suggest that the main effect of BPA on AS was to increase the generation of microbial soluble products. This work helps to understand the relationship between the biodegradation of BPA and readily biodegradable substrates.","['Acclimatization', 'Aerobiosis', 'Benzhydryl Compounds', 'Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Bioreactors', 'Carbon', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Phenols', 'Sewage', 'Substrate Specificity']",30242540,"[['G07.025.133', 'G16.012.500.133'], ['G02.111.017', 'G03.049'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.115'], ['N06.230.080.600.500', 'N06.850.460.375.500'], ['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['D01.268.150'], ['D02'], ['G03.680'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657'], ['D20.944.932.500'], ['G02.111.835']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

43443,Selective late steroid withdrawal after renal transplantation.,"Steroid withdrawal (SW) after paediatric renal transplantation (RTPL) is controversial. Selective late SW has been performed in our unit since 1995. The safety and effects of SW were analysed retrospectively in 47 patients undergoing RTPL between 1995 and 2004. Initial immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. Criteria for SW were: (1) stable renal function, (2) time interval after RTPL > or = 1 year, (3) no rejection or time interval after last rejection > or = 1 year and (4) good compliance. SW was performed in 30 patients at an age of 13.5 years (range 4.5-18.5) and 2.2 years (range 1-6.6) after RTPL. After SW, one patient experienced a steroid-sensitive rejection. Follow-up after SW (1.3 year; range 0.25-7.5) showed maintained renal function: glomerular filtration rate at SW and currently was 82 (65-128) and 82 (42-115) ml/min per 1.73 m(2), respectively.

13929,Molecular characterization of a German variant of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD Aachen).,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-chromosome-linked hereditary disorder. Clinically, patients with G6PD deficiency often present with drug- or food-induced hemolytic crises or neonatal jaundice. G6PD is involved in the generation of NADPH and reduced glutathione. In contrast to American, Mediterranean, and African ancestries, only few variants are known from Middle and Northern Europe. We describe the molecular characterization of a distinct variant from the northwestern area of Germany, G6PD Aachen. The sequence of the G6PD gene from three afflicted males was found to be hemizygous at cDNA residue 1089 for a C-->G mutation with a predicted amino acid change of Asn363Lys. The 1089 C-->G point mutation is unique, but produces the identical amino acid change found in a Mexican variant of G6PD deficiency, G6PD Loma Linda. This G6PD-deficient variant is caused by a 1089 C-->A mutation. The 363-amino-acid replacement is located outside a known mutation cluster region between amino acid residues 380 and 450, but may disrupt or weaken dimer interactions of G6PD enzyme subunits.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dimerization', 'Genetic Variation', 'Germany', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Point Mutation']",10772881,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.393.420.601.035', 'G05.558.109'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['G02.206', 'G03.230'], ['G05.365'], ['Z01.542.315'], ['D08.811.682.047.150.300'], ['C15.378.071.141.150.480', 'C16.320.070.480', 'C16.320.565.202.402', 'C18.452.648.202.402'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['G05.365.590.675']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
37405,Pediatric peritoneal dialysis in Korea: practical solutions to the problems of peritoneal dialysis for children.,"PURPOSE: To find and solve the common problems of peritoneal dialysis (PD) by analyzing the clinical data of pediatric PD performed in Korea.METHODS: We looked at 264 cases of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and acute PD that were performed in 18 institutions of pediatric nephrology in Korea from November 1987 to October 1997.RESULTS: CAPD was performed in 114 cases. The mean age of the patients was 10.5+/-6.6 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1. The original causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were proven in 92 cases (81%). The most common renal diseases were focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (17%), reflux nephropathy (11%), and chronic glomerulonephritis (11%). Mean duration of CAPD was 20 months+/-16.9 months. Peritonitis was the most common complication, and the peritonitis incidence was 0.96 episode per patient-year. Other complications were exit-site infection in 10 cases, obstruction in 7 cases, and leakage of dialysate in 6 cases. The most common etiologic organism of peritonitis was Staphylococcus aureus and the next most common was coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Acute PD was performed in 150 cases. The most common underlying causes were congenital heart disease, hemolytic uremic syndrome, sepsis, and dehydration. The mean duration was 10.3+/-11.3 days. The most common complication was peritonitis (78.3%). The most common etiologic organisms of peritonitis were Staphylococcus aureus, coag-neg staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas.CONCLUSION: Reflux nephropathy should be emphasized in early diagnosis and treatment to prevent ESRD. Incidence of congenital anomaly (7%) as a original cause of ESRD was relatively low in Korea. Growth status was not significantly improved after CAPD. In acute PD, the incidence of peritonitis rapidly increased at 2 weeks after the start of dialysis.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Growth', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Korea', 'Male', 'Peritoneal Dialysis', 'Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory', 'Peritonitis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",10406570,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['G07.345.249'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.777.419.780.750.500', 'C13.351.968.419.780.750.500'], ['Z01.252.474.557', 'Z01.586.407'], ['E02.870.300.650', 'E02.912.800.650'], ['E02.760.106.500', 'E02.870.300.650.500', 'E02.912.800.650.500', 'N02.421.585.106.500'], ['C01.463.600', 'C06.844.640'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
11157,Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of human brain activity during primary sensory stimulation.,"Neuronal activity causes local changes in cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and blood oxygenation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques sensitive to changes in cerebral blood flow and blood oxygenation were developed by high-speed echo planar imaging. These techniques were used to obtain completely noninvasive tomographic maps of human brain activity, by using visual and motor stimulus paradigms. Changes in blood oxygenation were detected by using a gradient echo (GE) imaging sequence sensitive to the paramagnetic state of deoxygenated hemoglobin. Blood flow changes were evaluated by a spin-echo inversion recovery (IR), tissue relaxation parameter T1-sensitive pulse sequence. A series of images were acquired continuously with the same imaging pulse sequence (either GE or IR) during task activation. Cine display of subtraction images (activated minus baseline) directly demonstrates activity-induced changes in brain MR signal observed at a temporal resolution of seconds. During 8-Hz patterned-flash photic stimulation, a significant increase in signal intensity (paired t test; P less than 0.001) of 1.8% +/- 0.8% (GE) and 1.8% +/- 0.9% (IR) was observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) of seven normal volunteers. The mean rise-time constant of the signal change was 4.4 +/- 2.2 s for the GE images and 8.9 +/- 2.8 s for the IR images. The stimulation frequency dependence of visual activation agrees with previous positron emission tomography observations, with the largest MR signal response occurring at 8 Hz. Similar signal changes were observed within the human primary motor cortex (M1) during a hand squeezing task and in animal models of increased blood flow by hypercapnia. By using intrinsic blood-tissue contrast, functional MRI opens a spatial-temporal window onto individual brain physiology.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Functional Laterality', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Oxygen', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Physical Stimulation', 'Rabbits', 'Time Factors', 'Touch', 'Visual Cortex']",1608978,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['G09.330.100.159'], ['F02.830.297.425', 'G11.561.225.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['H01.548'], ['E05.599'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['E05.723.729'], ['E05.723'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['G01.910.857'], ['F02.830.816.850', 'G11.561.790.850'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.571.735', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.814.953']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

29538,Imaging of conditional gene silencing in vivo using a bioluminescence-based method with thermo-inducible microRNAs.,"RNA interference (RNAi)-based gene therapy has great potential in cancer and infectious disease treatment to correct abnormal up-regulation of gene expression. We show a new original method uses synthetic microRNAs combined with a thermo-inducible promoter to reduce specific gene expression. The targeted gene is the luciferase firefly reporter gene overexpressed in a subcutaneous tumor which allows the RNAi monitoring by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). The inducible inhibition was first demonstrated in vitro using genetically modified cells lines and then in vivo using the corresponding xenograft model in mice. Achieving spatio-temporal control, we demonstrate the feasibility to induce, in vivo, a specific gene inhibition on demand.

3815,Cadmium transport in isolated perfused rat liver: zinc-cadmium competition.,"The hypothesis that one component of cadmium uptake by rat hepatocytes involves a mediated transport pathway normally operative for zinc transport was tested in the isolated perfused rat liver preparation. Excess zinc in the perfusion medium suppressed cadmium uptake as indicated by the decrease in the normalized clearance (initial clearance divided by liver weight) from 0.340 +/- 0.019 (ml/min)/g in the presence of normal zinc concentrations (Zn:Cd molar ratio, 1.6) to 0.138 +/- 0.017 (ml/min)/g (Zn:Cd molar ratio, 13.0). In excess-zinc control experiments (no cadmium present) little zinc is accumulated by the liver, apparently due to competition between intrahepatic and extracellular binding. Exposure to cadmium increases both zinc secretion into the perfusion medium and biliary excretion of zinc. The effect at the sinusoidal membrane is probably a result of both the blockage of zinc resorption during cadmium uptake and the displacement of intrahepatic zinc. The effect on biliary excretion of zinc is due solely to displacement of intrahepatic zinc. These results are consistent with the proposed hypothesis for cadmium transport.","['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cadmium', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Perfusion', 'Rats', 'Zinc']",426045,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4656,Precocious hypothyroidism mechanisms after radioiodine treatment in Graves' disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Hypothyroidism can occur after radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease. It may happen precociously and transiently in the first year after treatment. The purpose of this study was to understand the mechanisms responsible for precocious hypothyroidism.METHODS: 36 patients treated for Graves disease by radiodiodine were prospectively studied; The following variables were included in the analysis: age, gender, attendance for Graves' orbitopathy (GO), delay before radioiodine treatment, number of recurrences, previous treatments, corticosteroid therapy, thyroid mass, and (131)I dose. The titres of free T4 (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb), anti-thyroid peroxydase antibodies (TPOAb) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAb) were monitored. Thyroid stimulating (TSAb) and blocking (TBAb) antibodies were determined and (123)I uptake was measured when hypothyroidism occurred.RESULTS: 23 patients became precociously hypothyroid (group A) while 13 patients did not (group B). The initial TGAb titre was higher in group A (p=0.0024), and corticosteroid therapy was used more frequently to avoid aggravating GO in group B (p=0.0276). TPOAb and TGAb titres increased significantly only in group A (p=0.0112 and p=0.0202, respectively). When hypothyroidism occurred, TBAb was present in 13 patients. Transient hypothyroidism due to TBAb was observed in 1 patient. No iodide organification impairment was disclosed by the perchlorate test.CONCLUSION: Radioinduced thyroiditis appears to be the main mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of precocious hypothyroidism. A higher TGAb titre before treatment is associated with precocious hypothyroidism, suggesting the prognostic value of TGAb.

11871,Negative electrostatic contribution to the bending rigidity of charged membranes and polyelectrolytes screened by multivalent counterions.,"Bending rigidity of a charged membrane or polyelectrolyte screened by monovalent counterions is known to be enhanced by electrostatic effects. We show that in the case of screening by multivalent counterions the electrostatic effects reduce the bending rigidity. This inversion of the sign of the electrostatic contribution is related to the formation of two-dimensional strongly correlated liquids (SCL) of counterions at the charged surface due to strong lateral repulsion between them. When a membrane or a polyelectrolyte is bent, SCL is compressed on one side and stretched on the other so that thermodynamic properties of SCL contribute to the bending rigidity. Thermodynamic properties of SCL are similar to those of Wigner crystal and are anomalous in the sense that the pressure, compressibility and screening radius of SCL are negative. This brings about substantial negative correction to the bending rigidity. For the case of DNA this effect qualitatively agrees with experiment.","['Cations', 'DNA', 'Elasticity', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Chemical', 'Polyamines', 'Polyelectrolytes', 'Polymers', 'Static Electricity', 'Thermodynamics']",11970642,"[['D01.248.497.300'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G01.374.590'], ['D10.570.510', 'J01.637.087.500.510'], ['D25.479', 'J01.637.051.479', 'J01.637.087.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E05.599.495'], ['D02.092.782'], ['D01.248.700', 'D05.750.230'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720'], ['G01.358.500.249.820'], ['G01.906']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
34707,Papillon-Lef?vre syndrome: neutrophil function in 15 cases fron 4 families in Egypt.,"OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the periodontal pathologic cause of Papillon-Lef?vre syndrome by comparing, with respect to neutrophil function, probands with Papillon-Lef?vre syndrome from 4 families in Egypt, unaffected siblings of the probands, and age-matched and gender-matched control subjects.STUDY DESIGN: Family histories and clinical dermal and oral manifestations of Papillon-Lef?vre syndrome were evaluated for 15 affected members of 4 families with the syndrome, 10 siblings of the probands, and 7 age-matched and gender-matched controls. Phagocytic and intracellular killing (lytic activity) of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was evaluated for all subjects according to a modification of the method of Wilkinson; opsonization was evaluated according to a modification of the methods of Cutler et al. Data were analyzed by means of analysis of variance.RESULTS: Family pedigrees were plotted, and consanguinity was noted in 3 of the 4 families with Papillon-Lef?vre syndrome. The means and SDs for phagocytic killing, lytic activity, and opsonization indices were as follows: probands, 4.76+/-1.99, 0.42+/-0.20, and 0.84+/-0.07; unaffected siblings, 10.4+/-1.3, 3.3+/-0.3, and 0.84+/-0.07; controls, 10.8+/-0.8, 3.5+/-0.6, and 0.85+/-0.05. The phagocytic killing and lytic activity indices demonstrated significance between the probands and both siblings and controls (P<.0005), whereas the opsonization index did not demonstrate significance between groups.CONCLUSIONS: Significantly decreased neutrophil function in probands with Papillon-Lef?vre syndrome was demonstrated with respect to neutrophil phagocytotic and lytic activity but not with respect to opsonization. Therefore, specific neutrophil dysfunction appears to be etiologically involved in this disorder.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Bactericidal Activity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Consanguinity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neutrophils', 'Opsonin Proteins', 'Papillon-Lefevre Disease', 'Pedigree', 'Phagocytosis']",10503862,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['G09.188.100', 'G12.450.564.204'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['G05.090.403.180', 'G05.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.767', 'D12.776.124.486.657', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.767', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.767'], ['C16.320.850.475.600', 'C17.800.428.435.600', 'C17.800.827.475.600'], ['E05.393.673'], ['G04.417.350', 'G09.188.665', 'G12.450.564.809', 'G12.688']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (C statistics of logistic model) and the C statistics of the Cox model were used to evaluate whether the progression of diabetic complication status could be a predictor of ACS, ischemic stroke, and death. The optimum threshold for adverse outcomes risk stratification were obtained using Youden's J statistic as the cutoff that gives the highest threshold.RESULTS: Among the study patients, the C statistics of the logistic model of the progression of the score predictive of ACS, ischemic stroke, and death were 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.73), 0.84 (95% CI: 0.84-0.85), and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.65-0.67), respectively. The progression of adapted DCSI had moderate discrimination for ACS, ischemic stroke, and death (C statistics = 0.71, 0.72, and 0.75, respectively) based on Cox regression analysis (Harrell C). The optimum threshold of the progression of the score for ACS, ischemic stroke, and death in type 2 DM patients were 0.30, 0.36, and 0.39, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The acceptable discriminative power of the progression of adapted DCSI for Asian people affected by type 2 DM was demonstrated in a large cohort in Taiwan.","['Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Diabetes Complications', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Taiwan', 'Time Factors']",29896758,"[['C14.280.647.124', 'C14.907.585.124'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C10.228.140.300.150', 'C14.907.253.092'], ['C19.246.099'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.370.800.750', 'E05.318.740.872.750', 'N05.715.360.325.700.680', 'N06.850.520.445.800.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['Z01.252.474.872', 'Z01.639.850'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
5668,Acetate-bridged platinum(III) complexes derived from cisplatin.,"Oxidation of the acetate-bridged half-lantern platinum(II) complex cis-[Pt(II)(NH(3))(2)(ì-OAc)(2)Pt(II)(NH(3))(2)](NO(3))(2), [1](NO(3))(2), with iodobenzene dichloride or bromine generates the halide-capped platinum(III) species cis-[XPt(III)(NH(3))(2)(ì-OAc)(2)Pt(III)(NH(3))(2)X](NO(3))(2), where X is Cl in [2](NO(3))(2) or Br in [3](NO(3))(2), respectively. These three complexes, characterized structurally by X-ray crystallography, feature short (?2.6 ?) Pt-Pt separations, consistent with formation of a formal metal-metal bond upon oxidation. Elongated axial Pt-X distances occur, reflecting the strong trans influence of the metal-metal bond. The three structures are compared to those of other known dinuclear platinum complexes. A combination of (1)H, (13)C, (14)N, and (195)Pt NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize [1](2+)-[3](2+) in solution. All resonances shift downfield upon oxidation of [1](2+) to [2](2+) and [3](2+). For the platinum(III) complexes, the (14)N and (195)Pt resonances exhibit decreased line widths by comparison to those of [1](2+). Density functional theory calculations suggest that the decrease in the (14)N line width arises from a diminished electric field gradient at the (14)N nuclei in the higher valent compounds. The oxidation of [1](NO(3))(2) with the alternative oxidizing agent bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene affords the novel tetranuclear complex cis-[(O(2)CCF(3))Pt(III)(NH(3))(2)(ì-OAc)(2)Pt(III)(NH(3))(ì-NH(2))](2)(NO(3))(4), [4](NO(3))(4), also characterized structurally by X-ray crystallography.

28610,Localization of newly synthesized precursors of basal lamina in the regenerating planarian as revealed by autoradiography.,"Autoradiography has been carried out to investigate the site of synthesis of the basal lamina in the regenerating planarian, Dugesia japonica. Since the basic collagenous structures of the basal lamina rose from RR-positive amorphous precursor, [3H]proline, [3H]glucose and [35S]sodium sulphate were used as radioactive precursors of collagen, unsulphated and sulphated GAG respectively. Cytoplasm of the most regenerating epidermal cells was heavily labeled with [3H]proline during epithelization. A quantitative uptake analysis of [3H]proline indicates a progressive decline in the amount of labeled precursor in the epidermis with a corresponding increase in deposition of the labeled collagen at the presumptive basal lamina. Several myoblasts at the subepidermal region were highly labeled with both [3H]glucose and [35S]sodium sulphate. Silver grains of these labeled precursors were also present in the presumptive portion of basal lamina. These observations suggest that the regenerating epidermal cell is the only site of synthesis of the basal lamina collagen while the myoblast exclusively secretes extracellular GAG. Some of the GAG may be closely associated with the amorphous zone.","['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Collagen', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Epidermis', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Muscles', 'Planarians', 'Regeneration', 'Turbellaria']",7434335,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.750.132', 'E05.200.750.132', 'E05.799.256'], ['D05.750.078.280', 'D12.776.860.300.250'], ['A11.409'], ['A10.272.497', 'A17.815.250'], ['D09.698.373'], ['A02.633', 'A10.690'], ['B01.050.500.500.736.847.610'], ['G16.762'], ['B01.050.500.500.736.847']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

16428,Histologic Evaluation of Critical Size Defect Healing With Natural and Synthetic Bone Grafts in the Pigeon ( Columba livia ) Ulna.,"Fracture and bone segment loss are major clinical problems in birds. Achieving bone formation and clinical union in a fracture case is important for the survival of the bird. To evaluate the efficacy of bone grafts for defect healing in birds, 2 different bone grafts were investigated in the healing of a bone defect in 24 healthy pigeons ( Columba livia ). In each bird, a 1-cm critical size defect (CSD) was created in the left ulna, and the fracture was stabilized with external skeletal fixation (ESF). A graft of hydroxyapatite (HA) alone (n = 12 birds) or demineralized bone matrix (DBM) combined with HA (n = 12 birds) was implanted in the CSD. The CSD healing was evaluated at 3 endpoints: 3, 6, and 12 weeks after surgery. Four birds were euthanatized at each endpoint from each treatment group, and bone graft healing in the ulna CSD was evaluated by histologic examination. The CSD and graft implants were evaluated for quality of union, cortex development, and bone graft incorporation. Results showed no graft rejection in any bird, and all birds had connective tissue formation in the defect because of the bone graft application. These results suggest that bone defect healing can be achieved by a combination of osteoinductive and osteoconductive bone graft materials for clinical union and new bone regeneration in birds. The combination of DBM and HA resulted in a better quality bone graft (P < .05) than did HA alone, but there was no significant differences in cortex development or bone graft incorporation at 3, 6, or 12 weeks. From the results of this study, we conclude that HA bone grafts, alone or in combination with DBM, with external skeletal fixation is suitable and safe for bone defect and fracture treatment in pigeons.","['Animals', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Substitutes', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Columbidae', 'Durapatite', 'Fracture Fixation', 'Fractures, Bone', 'Wings, Animal']",26115209,"[['B01.050'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['A10.165.265.166'], ['D25.130.325', 'J01.637.051.130.325'], ['E02.095.147.725.052', 'E04.555.130', 'E04.936.580.052'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.165.150'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374.075.025.300.150', 'D01.146.360.050.300.200', 'D01.578.122.477.300', 'D01.695.625.675.650.075.025.300.150'], ['E04.555.300'], ['C26.404'], ['A13.395.823']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
44799,Enhancing ascorbate in fruits and tubers through over-expression of the L-galactose pathway gene GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase.,"Ascorbate, or vitamin C, is obtained by humans mostly from plant sources. Various approaches have been made to increase ascorbate in plants by transgenic means. Most of these attempts have involved leaf material from model plants, with little success reported using genes from the generally accepted l-galactose pathway of ascorbate biosynthesis. We focused on increasing ascorbate in commercially significant edible plant organs using a gene, GDP-l-galactose phosphorylase (GGP or VTC2), that we had previously shown to increase ascorbate concentration in tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana. The coding sequence of Actinidia chinensis GGP, under the control of the 35S promoter, was expressed in tomato and strawberry. Potato was transformed with potato or Arabidopsis GGP genes under the control of the 35S promoter or a polyubiquitin promoter (potato only). Five lines of tomato, up to nine lines of potato, and eight lines of strawberry were regenerated for each construct. Three lines of tomato had a threefold to sixfold increase in fruit ascorbate, and all lines of strawberry showed a twofold increase. All but one line of each potato construct also showed an increase in tuber ascorbate of up to threefold. Interestingly, in tomato fruit, increased ascorbate was associated with loss of seed and the jelly of locular tissue surrounding the seed which was not seen in strawberry. In both strawberry and tomato, an increase in polyphenolic content was associated with increased ascorbate.

8461,"Physician glut. Physicians--the next victims of ""downsizing?"".","Should physicians really be polishing up their CVs or preparing to enter another line of work? In a word: No. What a recent survey makes clear is that, while managed care is driving physicians from some markets, jobs are still available in other markets traditionally underserved by physicians. This is not to suggest that the physician employment market has gone unchanged. Many physicians, particularly specialists, have taken income hits, and some specialists truly are in need of work. Primary care physicians, however, have seen their stars rise and are now in a position to work wherever they want. Physicians may no longer be able to practice within 50 miles of where they were raised or where they were trained, as has been their wont. Instead, they will have to do what other professionals have long done--go where job opportunities take them. In short, they will have to add a career strategy to their scientific mindset, and that means an aggressive job search, coupled with a strong consumer orientation.","['Consumer Behavior', 'Employment', 'Job Application', 'Personnel Administration, Hospital', 'Physicians', 'United States', 'Vocational Guidance']",10160035,"[['F01.145.236'], ['N01.824.245'], ['N04.452.677.400'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.565', 'N04.452.442.452.422.565', 'N04.452.677.440'], ['M01.526.485.810', 'N02.360.810'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['F02.784.629.937', 'F02.784.692.887']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

41131,Pathological prognostic factors in breast carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE: Pathological prognostic factors in breast cancer are now widely used to predict biological behavior of cancer and to plan its effective management. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the reports from our histopathology laboratory spanning over a period of 4 years, to assess completeness in recording these factors. It will enable us to improve and standardize reporting on breast cancer.METHODS: The pathology reports of primary carcinoma of the breast diagnosed in our laboratory from 1st January 1994 to 31st December 1997 (4 year period) were reviewed for details on tumor size, histological type and grade, presence or absence of tumor emboli in vascular channels, proximity of the tumor to resection margins and lymph node status.RESULTS: Tumor size was not recorded in 1 case each in 1994, 1995 and 1996 and 2 cases in 1997. Histological type was mentioned in all cases in 1995 and 1997. It was not mentioned in 1 case in 1994 and 3 cases in 1996. Out of 77 cases with axillary clearance, the total number of lymph nodes was recorded in 83% of cases. The number of lymph nodes with metastasis was recorded in 71% of cases.CONCLUSION: Our histopathology laboratory receives the majority of surgical biopsies carried out in the Sultanate of Oman. During our study period we received a total of 45354 biopsies. From 1993 onwards, pathological prognostic factors of breast carcinoma were incorporated in our pathology reports following the publication of major and leading articles regarding the same. This study shows an improvement in the quality of reports after introducing this concept in 1994. This study clearly reveals the necessity for written protocols to be established, to standardize and improve the quality of reporting.","['Biopsy', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Audit', 'Medical Records', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oman', 'Population Surveillance', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",11533822,"[['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E04.446'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['E04.466'], ['N04.761.700.250.500', 'N05.700.175.500'], ['E05.318.308.940.968', 'N04.452.859.564', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500', 'N06.850.520.308.940.968'], ['I02.594', 'N03.349.380.565', 'N05.300.537'], ['E01.789.625'], ['Z01.252.245.500.600'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['N04.761.700.350.650', 'N05.700.350.650'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

It was also hypothesized that using the features collectively would increase the accuracy of prediction over using individual characteristics. Significant differences were found for 6 of the 16 features, and predictive power was substantially increased by using all the features as indicators of their respective traits. These drawing characteristics have diagnostic value, but their relatively infrequent occurrence and the presence of most features in the drawings of all four groups require cautious clinical assessment of drawings exhibiting these features.","['Adolescent', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aggression', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Art', 'Body Image', 'Humans', 'Juvenile Delinquency', 'Male', 'Social Isolation']",6886958,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.145.126.100'], ['F01.145.126.125', 'F01.145.813.045'], ['F03.675.050'], ['K01.093'], ['F01.752.747.792.110', 'F02.463.593.112'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.880.735.479'], ['F01.145.813.781', 'I01.880.853.748']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
8003,Evidence for nucleosome depletion at active regulatory regions genome-wide.,"The identification of nuclease-hypersensitive sites in an active globin gene and in the 5' regions of fruit fly heat shock genes first suggested that chromatin changes accompany gene regulation in vivo. Here we present evidence that the basic repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin, nucleosomes, are depleted from active regulatory elements throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome in vivo. We found that during rapid mitotic growth, the level of nucleosome occupancy is inversely proportional to the transcriptional initiation rate at the promoter. We also observed a partial loss of histone H3 and H4 tetramers from the coding regions of the most heavily transcribed genes. Alterations in the global transcriptional program caused by heat shock or a change in carbon source resulted in an increased nucleosome occupancy at repressed promoters, and a decreased nucleosome occupancy at promoters that became active. Nuclease-hypersensitive sites occur in species from yeast to humans and result from chromatin perturbation. Given the conservation of sequence and function among components of both chromatin and the transcriptional machinery, nucleosome depletion at promoters may be a fundamental feature of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation.","['Genes, Fungal', 'Histones', 'Nucleosomes', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Transcription, Genetic']",15247917,"[['G05.360.340.024.340.364.500', 'G05.360.340.358.024.500', 'G05.360.340.358.365.500'], ['D12.776.157.687.485', 'D12.776.660.720.485', 'D12.776.664.469'], ['A11.284.430.106.279.345.190.160.180.625', 'D12.776.664.224.550', 'G05.360.160.180.625'], ['G02.111.570.080.689', 'G05.360.080.689'], ['B01.300.107.795.785.800', 'B01.300.930.705.655'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
32888,In vivo study of transepithelial potential difference (TEPD) in proximal convoluted tubules of rat kidney by synchronization modulation electric field.,"Synchronization modulation (SM) electric field has been shown to effectively activate function of Na(+)/K(+) pumps in various cells and tissues, including skeletal muscle cells, cardiomyocyte, monolayer of cultured cell line, and peripheral blood vessels. We are now reporting the in vivo studies in application of the SM electric field to kidney of living rats. The field-induced changes in the transepithelial potential difference (TEPD) or the lumen potential from the proximal convoluted tubules were monitored. The results showed that a short time (20 s) application of the SM electric field can significantly increase the magnitude of TEPD from 1-2 mV to about 20 mV. The TEPD is an active potential representing the transport current of the Na/K pumps in epithelial wall of renal tubules. This study showed that SM electric field can increase TEPD by activation of the pump molecules. Considering renal tubules, many active transporters are driven by the Na(+) concentration gradient built by the Na(+)/K(+) pumps, activation of the pump functions and increase in the magnitude of TEPD imply that the SM electric field may improve reabsorption functions of the renal tubules.","['Animals', 'Ion Transport', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Microelectrodes', 'Rats', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase']",24894719,"[['B01.050'], ['G03.143.500'], ['A05.810.453.736.560.570'], ['G01.154.535', 'G04.580', 'G07.265.675', 'G11.561.570'], ['E07.305.250.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.750', 'D12.776.157.530.450.162.780', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.880', 'D12.776.157.530.813.750', 'D12.776.543.585.450.162.800', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.890', 'D12.776.543.585.813.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

36839,High-resolution 1H-NMR spectroscopy of free and glycosidically linked O-acetylated sialic acids.,"A number of naturally occurring and synthetic, partially O-acetylated derivatives of N-acetylneuraminic and N-glycoloylneuraminic acids have been investigated by 360-MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy. O-Acetylation causes strong downfield shifts for the resonances of neighbouring sugar-skeleton protons. The chemical shifts of these resonances, together with their characteristic multiplet shapes, can be used for localisation of the position of O-acetyl substituents in the molecule. The number of such substituents in the molecule can be inferred from the number of acetyl-methyl singlets, which also have characteristic resonance positions. This method for determination of the number and position of O-acetyl substituents in sialic acid residues is very powerful for structural analysis of underivatized carbohydrate chains derived from glycoconjugates. This is demonstrated for the oligosaccharide N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminosyl-(alpha 2 leads to 3)-lactose isolated from echidna milk.","['Acetylation', 'Glycosides', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Sialic Acids']",7060578,"[['G02.111.012.052', 'G02.607.063.052', 'G03.040.052'], ['D09.408'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['D09.698.629'], ['D02.241.081.844.562.668', 'D02.241.511.902.562.668', 'D09.067.687.668', 'D09.811.589.668']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41627,Simultaneous quantification of Schisandrin B enantiomers in rat plasma by chiral LC-MS/MS: Application in a stereoselective pharmacokinetic study.,"Schisandrin B (Sch B) has received much attention owing to its various biological activities. Schisandrin B exists as a racemate in ""wuweizi"", a traditional Chinese medicine in China. In the present study, a novel chiral LC-MS/MS method was developed for enantioselective separation and determination of Schisandrin B in rat plasma. The plasma samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). Schisandrol B was used as internal standard. Chiral separation was obtained on a Chiralpak IC column using 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in mixture of methanol and water (90:10, v/v) as a mobile phase. Parameters including the selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, extraction recovery, matrix effect and stability were evaluated. The method described here is simple and reproducible. The lower limit of quantification of 5.0 ng/mL for each Sch B enantiomer permits the use of the method in investigating the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of Sch B. Following racemic Sch B and ""wuweizi"" extracts, the area under the curve of (8R, 8'S)-Sch B was statistically higher than the one of (8S, 8' R)-Sch B, with a ratio of 1.16-1.40 in three cases. This study firstly reports the development and validation of enantioselective behavior of Sch B in vivo, and provides a reference for clinical practice and encourages further research into Sch B enantioselective metabolism and drug interactions.","['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cyclooctanes', 'Dioxoles', 'Lignans', 'Male', 'Polycyclic Compounds', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",29990885,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.158'], ['E05.196.181.400'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.408'], ['D03.383.246'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.140.450'], ['D04'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['G02.607.445.682'], ['E05.196.566.880']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9455,The Role of the Notch Signal Pathway in Mucosal Cell Metaplasia in Mouse Acute Otitis Media.,"Otitis media (OM) is a major cause of morbidity in pediatric and adult patients. This inflammatory condition is characterized by mucous cell hyperplasia that is thought to produce mucins from the middle ear mucosa. We are interested in the role of Notch signalling pathway in this inflammatory process. Using an acute otitis media (AOM) mouse model through injection of Streptococcus Pneumoniae into the middle ear, histopathologic examination and quantitative RT-PCR, acute inflammation with the thickness of mucosa, Goblet cell hyperplasia, and cilia loss were determined and gene expression related to the Notch signaling pathway were evaluated. Upregulation of the mucous cell markers, Argr2 and Muc5AC, and downregulation of the cilia cell marker, Foxj1 and Dnai2, were observed in AOM. In addition, genes encoding Notch receptors and ligands (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Notch4 and Dll1) and the Notch target genes (Hes1, Hes5, Hey1, NRARP) in AOM decreased significantly. The expression of the Notch1 and Jagged1 also showed down-regulation throughout the mouse middle ear epithelium. Taken together, this study suggests that downregulation of the Notch signaling pathway is involved in the mucosa hyperplasia during AOM.","['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cilia', 'Goblet Cells', 'Male', 'Metaplasia', 'Mice', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Otitis Media', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Signal Transduction']",28676722,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.101'], ['A11.284.180.165'], ['A03.556.124.369.320', 'A04.329.597.320', 'A04.531.520.320', 'A04.760.259', 'A10.615.550.444.321', 'A10.615.550.760.520.320', 'A10.615.550.760.600.320', 'A11.436.298'], ['C23.550.589'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A10.615.550'], ['C09.218.705.663'], ['D12.776.543.750.725', 'D12.776.930.770'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2785,cAMP-independent effects of cholera toxin on B cell activation. III. Cholera toxin A subunit-mediated ADP-ribosylation acts synergistically with ionomycin or IL-4 to induce B cell proliferation.,"To investigate whether ADP-ribosylation of proteins by cholera toxin could influence B cell activation, B cells were incubated with the A subunit of cholera toxin. Ionomycin acted synergistically to induce B cell proliferation with the A subunit of cholera toxin but not with cAMP-enhancing agents or with the B subunit of cholera toxin, suggesting that the synergistic effect of the A subunit was mediated via ADP-ribosylation and not via cAMP elevations or ganglioside GM1 binding. Indeed, inhibitors of ADP-ribosylation blocked the synergistic effect. Unlike anti-Ig, B cell proliferation stimulated by LPS or by the combination of the A subunit and ionomycin was observed in protein kinase C (PKC)-depleted B cells. However, neither the A subunit nor ionomycin enhanced B cell proliferation stimulated by low dose LPS, suggesting that the A subunit plus ionomycin stimulated an activation pathway distinct from the LPS-stimulated pathway. Additionally, unlike LPS, the A subunit plus ionomycin did not stimulate B cells in vitro to secrete Ig. IL-4 acted synergistically with the A subunit to induce B cell proliferation to the same extent as it did with anti-Ig; unlike the anti-Ig plus IL-4 synergy, however, the A subunit plus IL-4-mediated synergy persisted in PKC-depleted B cells. Taken together, our data suggest that cholera toxin A subunit-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation modifies a non-Gs protein involved in the activation of B cells, either through a novel pathway or at a point distal to the activation of PKC along the anti-Ig-stimulated pathway.","['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Calcimycin', 'Cholera Toxin', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Interleukin-4', 'Ionomycin', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Signal Transduction', 'X Chromosome']",7730606,"[['D03.633.100.759.646.138.124.070.125', 'D09.408.620.569.070.125', 'D13.695.667.138.124.070.125', 'D13.695.827.068.124.070.125', 'D13.695.827.708.070.125'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['D03.633.100.221.173'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.115.180', 'D23.946.123.194', 'D23.946.330.150'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['G07.690.773.968.477'], ['C20.673'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.186', 'D12.776.467.374.465.178', 'D23.529.374.465.186'], ['D10.251.355.391'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.440', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.440'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.500'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A11.284.187.865.982', 'G05.360.162.865.982']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1407,Frequent and variable abnormalities in p14 tumor suppressor gene in glioma cell lines.,"Ten glioma cell lines were examined for abnormalities of exon 1beta of the p14 gene and then for abnormalities of the entire p14 gene with the use of previous findings of other exons. Abnormalities of exon 1beta and the entire p14 gene were detected in eight of ten cases: homozygous deletion of the entire gene in six cases, hemizygous deletion of exon 1beta with homozygous deletion of downstream exons in one case, and hemizygous deletion of the entire coding region with a missense mutation (A97V) at the C-terminal nucleolar localization domain in one case.

In the three cases with p14 gene expression, immunocytochemistry revealed p14 nucleolar staining, suggesting the retention of the functional activity of p14 protein and, in the case with the A97V mutation, an insufficient mutational effect as well.

23284,Effect of liquid meals on duodenogastric reflux in humans.,"In humans duodenogastric reflux and gastric emptying were measured simultaneously by a two-marker technique that avoids transpyloric intubation. The duodenal marker consisted of 99mTc-labeled Hepatobida and was infused intravenously at a constant rate. Hepatobida was cleared almost exclusively by the liver and entered the duodenum at a constant rate via the bile. The gastric marker consisted of 51CrCl2 and was used to measure total intragastric volume by the double-sampling technique. Duodenogastric reflux occurred both after meals and under fasting conditions. Reflux rate was on the average 13 times smaller than emptying rate. It was higher with a lipid than with a protein meal and was independent of the rate of gastric emptying. The gastric concentration and total amount of duodenal contents were higher after lipid than protein meals. Since gastric emptying of a protein meal was faster than emptying of a lipid meal, the increased gastric concentration and accumulation of duodenal contents after lipid meals are due to a slowed gastric clearing and increased reflux of duodenal contents. Under fasting conditions, the reflux was lower and the gastric concentration of duodenal contents was higher than with both types of meals. Hence regurgitated duodenal contents may cause more damage to the gastric mucosa under fasting conditions than postprandially.","['Adult', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Fasting', 'Fat Emulsions, Intravenous', 'Female', 'Gastric Emptying', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Mathematics', 'Peptones', 'Stomach', 'Technetium']",6896405,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A03.556.124.684.124', 'A03.556.875.249'], ['G07.203.650.283', 'G10.261.330'], ['F01.145.407.400', 'G07.203.650.240.587', 'G07.203.650.353.400'], ['D26.255.165.260.270', 'D26.776.708.733.500', 'D27.505.954.578.733.500', 'D27.720.752.733.500'], ['G10.261.360.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['H01.548'], ['D12.776.719'], ['A03.556.875.875'], ['D01.268.271.870', 'D01.268.556.843', 'D01.268.956.875', 'D01.496.749.305.870', 'D01.552.544.843']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
38196,HER2-targeted recombinant protein immuno-caspase-6 effectively induces apoptosis in HER2-overexpressing GBM cells in vitro and in vivo.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, is among the most malignant and treatment-refractory neoplasms in human adults. As GBM is highly resistant to conventional therapies, immunotherapies are a promising treatment candidate. HER2 is an attractive target for GBM immunotherapy, as its expression is highly associated with various types of GBM. We previously reported that a novel HER2-targeted recombinant protein e23sFv-Fdt-casp6 has an antitumor effect on HER2-positive gastric cancer cells. In this study, we established a genetically modified Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which produced and secreted e23sFv-Fdt-casp6 proteins. Following specific binding to and internalization into HER2-overexpressing tumor cells, the e23sFv-Fdt-casp6 protein induced tumor cell apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of HER2-overexpressing A172 and U251MG cells in vitro, but not in U87MG cells with undetectable HER2. The e23sFv-Fdt-casp6 gene was introduced into severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing human glioblastoma xenografts by using intramuscular injections of a liposome-encapsulated vector. The recombinant protein e23sFv-Fdt-casp6 specifically targeted tumor cells and induced apoptosis, thereby leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. We concluded that e23sFv‑Fdt‑casp6 represents a promising HER2-targeted treatment option for human gliomas.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'CHO Cells', 'Caspase 6', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioblastoma', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",27633091,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['A11.251.210.200', 'A11.436.155'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126.350.600', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126.350.600', 'D12.644.360.075.405.350.600', 'D12.776.476.075.405.350.600'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250.250'], ['G05.308.370'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.380.080.335', 'C04.557.470.670.380.080.335', 'C04.557.580.625.600.380.080.335'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074.400', 'D12.776.624.664.700.642', 'D23.050.301.500.600.700', 'D23.050.705.552.600.550', 'D23.101.140.642'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['E05.337.550.200.900', 'E05.624.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
31320,Intracellular Ca2+ stores could participate to abscisic acid-induced depolarization and stomatal closure in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"In Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension, abscisic acid (ABA) induces changes in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) which are the trigger for ABA-induced plasma membrane anion current activation, H(+)-ATPase inhibition, and subsequent plasma membrane depolarization. In the present study, we took advantage of this model to analyze the implication of intracellular Ca(2+) stores in ABA signal transduction through electrophysiological current measurements, cytosolic Ca(2+) activity measurements with the apoaequorin Ca(2+) reporter protein and external pH measurement. Intracellular Ca(2+) stores involvement was determined by using specific inhibitors of CICR channels: the cADP-ribose/ryanodine receptor (Br-cADPR and dantrolene) and of the inositol trisphosphate receptor (U73122). In addition experiments were performed on epidermal strips of A. thaliana leaves to monitor stomatal closure in response to ABA in presence of the same pharmacology. Our data provide evidence that ryanodine receptor and inositol trisphosphate receptor could be involved in ABA-induced (1) Ca(2+) release in the cytosol, (2) anion channel activation and H(+)-ATPase inhibition leading to plasma membrane depolarization and (3) stomatal closure. Intracellular Ca(2+) release could thus contribute to the control of early events in the ABA signal transduction pathway in A. thaliana.","['Abscisic Acid', 'Alkalies', 'Arabidopsis', 'Calcium', 'Culture Media', 'Extracellular Space', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Intracellular Space', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Plant Stomata', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Time Factors']",19847112,"[['D02.241.223.268.034', 'D02.455.326.271.665.202.061', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249.024', 'D02.455.849.131.061', 'D02.455.849.765.521.500'], ['D01.045'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.157.100'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['A10.082.500', 'A11.284.295'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.760', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.760', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.760', 'D12.776.826.179'], ['A10.082.750', 'A11.284.430'], ['G02.111.820.400', 'G04.835.400', 'G07.265.625'], ['G01.154.535', 'G04.580', 'G07.265.675', 'G11.561.570'], ['A18.024.750.650', 'A18.024.812.650'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150.800', 'D12.776.210.500.800', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150.800', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150.800'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
834,[Gamma knife radiosurgery in neurosurgery].,"The gamma knife is a stereotactic radiosurgery device which allows well defined, deep seated brain tumors, or arteriovenous malformations having a diameter of less than 3 cm, to be treated in a single session under local anesthesia. This technique, which was first described over 40 years ago, has undergone major development in recent years and is the most commonly used method for radiosurgery worldwide. The principle relies on the over-lapping of narrow collimated beams from 201 cobalt-60 sources. The technique, which was introduced into Switzerland in September 1994, has rapidly gained recognition. 184 patients have been treated by 30 April 1997. An average follow-up period of 15 months is much too short for analysis of patients treated by radiosurgery. However, our series of benign tumors shows stabilization of volume in the first few months followed by a slow reduction of the tumor volume, in all but two cases. The gamma knife represents the treatment of choice for recurrent and unsuccessfully operated patients with endocrine active pituitary adenomas. With brain metastases, a rapid reduction in tumor volume is seen in the first few weeks in the majority of cases. The tumor volume may then remain stable or reduce further until complete disappearance. In the case of arteriovenous malformations complete obliteration of the nidus is not seen, on average, for 2-3 years. Individual patient follow-up studies illustrate these results. To date our results have shown zero morbidity and mortality. International statistics from 58,766 cases (as of December 1996) from 77 gamma knife centers demonstrate the value of this technique as a complement or, depending on the indication, an alternative to classical microsurgery.","['Anesthesia, Local', 'Arteriovenous Malformations', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Neurosurgery', 'Radiosurgery']",9522414,"[['E03.155.086.231'], ['C14.240.850.750', 'C14.907.150', 'C16.131.240.850.750'], ['C04.588.614.250.195', 'C10.228.140.211', 'C10.551.240.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H02.403.810.425'], ['E02.815.530', 'E04.525.800.650', 'E05.873.500']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
1301,In situ loading of ultra-small Cu2O particles on TiO2 nanosheets to enhance the visible-light photoactivity.,"In this work, ultra-small Cu(2)O nanoparticles have been loaded on TiO(2) nanosheets with {001} facets exposed through a one-pot hydrothermal reaction. These Cu(2)O nanoparticles are well-dispersed on TiO(2) nanosheets with narrow size distributions and controllable sizes from 1.5 to 3.0 nm. Through XRD, TEM, N(2) absorption-desorption isotherms and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, the Cu(2)O/TiO(2) nanosheets show similar phase structures, morphologies, pore structures as compared to pure TiO(2) nanosheets. Due to the loading of ultra-small Cu(2)O nanoparticles, heterojunctions are formed between Cu(2)O and TiO(2), which favors the efficient separation of photo-generated electrons and holes. Caused by the electron transfer from Cu(2)O to TiO(2), Cu(2)O/TiO(2) nanosheets show excellent visible-light activity, about 3 times that of N-doped TiO(2) nanosheets with {001} facets exposed. Furthermore, charge transfer rate across the interface of Cu(2)O and TiO(2) shows great dependence on the size of Cu(2)O particles. The charge transfer across the interface may be more efficient between TiO(2) nanosheets and smaller Cu(2)O nanoparticles. Therefore, the Ti : Cu = 30 : 1(atomic ratio) sample shows the best activity due to its balance in light harvest and electron transfer rate in the degradation of phenol under visible light.","['Absorption', 'Copper', 'Metal Nanoparticles', 'Nanostructures', 'Nanotechnology', 'Particle Size', 'Phenol', 'Photolysis', 'Porosity', 'Titanium']",22945479,"[['G01.015', 'G02.010', 'G03.015', 'G03.787.024', 'G07.690.725.015'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['J01.637.512.600.500'], ['J01.637.512'], ['H01.603', 'J01.897.520.600'], ['G02.712'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.595'], ['G02.740.685'], ['G01.374.710'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

35131,Evidence of increasing public participation in advance care planning: a comparison of polls in Alberta between 2007 and 2013.,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) encompasses both verbal and written communications expressing preferences for future health and personal care and helps prepare people for healthcare decision-making in times of medical crisis. Healthcare systems are increasingly promoting ACP as a way to inform medical decision-making, but it is not clear how public engagement in ACP activities is changing over time.METHODS: Raw data from 3 independently conducted public polls on ACP engagement, in the same Canadian province, were analysed to assess whether participation in ACP activities changed over 6 years.RESULTS: Statistically significant increases were observed between 2007 and 2013 in: recognising the definition of ACP (54.8% to 80.3%, OR 3.37 (95% CI 2.68 to 4.24)), discussions about healthcare preferences with family (48.4% to 59.8%, OR 1.41 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.69)) and with healthcare providers (9.1% to 17.4%, OR 1.98 (95% CI 1.51 to 2.59)), written ACP plans (21% to 34.6%, OR 1.77 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.17)) and legal documentation (23.4% to 42.7%, OR 2.13 (95% CI 1.75 to 2.59)). These remained significant after adjusting for age, education and self-rated health status.CONCLUSIONS: ACP engagement increased over time, although the overall frequency remains low in certain elements such as discussing ACP with healthcare providers. We discuss factors that may be responsible for the increase and provide suggestions for healthcare systems or other public bodies seeking to stimulate engagement in ACP.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alberta', 'Community Participation', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",26817793,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N04.590.233.624.124'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['Z01.107.567.176.064'], ['N02.421.143.212', 'N03.540.245.360'], ['I01.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

41153,Enzymatic preparation of an artificial microRNA library.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous RNAs of about 20-25 nucleotides that play important roles in gene regulation. Based on miRNA backbones, artificial miRNAs, amiRNAs, can be constructed and expressed exogenously. AmiRNAs can function as natural miRNAs or siRNAs. AmiRNAs display higher expression levels and more potent silencing efficiency than simple shRNAs. In practice, an amiRNA library is usually needed to screen for functional amiRNAs. Here we describe a novel, convenient, and cost-effective method for enzymatically constructing an amiRNA library. A novel strategy was applied to ensure the correct orientation of the anti-sense strand and also render less thermo-stability to the 5' end of anti-sense strand to facilitate its entry into the RISC complex, which can largely increase the silencing efficiency. Furthermore, a ""Padlock probe"" method was also incorporated to ensure the fidelity of the sequence and stem-loop structure. To test the feasibility of the method, an amiRNA library targeting mouse p53 ORF was constructed. Through screening of 82 amiRNAs in the library, 7 amiRNAs which displayed potent p53-silencing efficiency were identified and verified. This method also has the potential to construct an amiRNA library that targets a whole transcriptome for genome-wide RNAi screening, or a randomized amiRNA library to search for functional amiRNAs.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Library', 'Gene Targeting', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA Interference', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",19836357,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D08.811'], ['G05.360.325'], ['E05.393.335'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D13.150.650.319', 'D13.444.735.150.319', 'D13.444.735.790.552.500'], ['G02.111.570.820.486', 'G05.360.580'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

33371,Evaluation of the Etest and disk diffusion methods for determining susceptibilities of 235 bloodstream isolates of Candida glabrata to fluconazole and voriconazole.,"The performances of the Etest and the disk diffusion methods for testing of the susceptibilities of 235 Candida glabrata isolates to fluconazole and voriconazole were compared with that of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) approved standard broth microdilution (BMD) method. The NCCLS method used RPMI 1640 broth medium, and MICs were read after incubation for 48 h at 35 degrees C. Etest MICs were determined with RPMI 1640 agar containing 2% glucose (RPG agar) and with Mueller-Hinton agar containing 2% glucose and 0.5 microg of methylene blue per ml (MBE agar) and were read after incubation for 48 h at 35 degrees C. Disk diffusion testing was performed with MBE agar, 25-microg fluconazole disks, and 1- microg voriconazole disks and by incubation at 35 degrees C for 24 h. Overall agreements between the Etest and the BMD MICs obtained with RPG and MBE agars were 91 and 96%, respectively, for fluconazole and 93 and 95%, respectively, for voriconazole.

47388,c-ABL tyrosine kinase modulates p53-dependent p21 induction and ensuing cell fate decision in response to DNA damage.,"The c-ABL non-receptor tyrosine kinase and the p53 tumor suppressor protein are pivotal modulators of cellular responses to DNA damage. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of c-ABL kinase in p53-dependent transcription of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and ensuing cell fate decision is still obscure. Here, we demonstrate that c-ABL tyrosine kinase regulates p53-dependent induction of p21. As a result, it modulates cell fate decision by p53 in response to DNA damage differently according to the extent of DNA damage. When human cancer cells were treated with DNA damaging agent, adriamycin (0.08 ìg/ml), p21 was induced following p53 induction. Owing largely to p21, a substantial fraction of cells treated with adriamycin were blocked at the G2 phase of the cell cycle and most cells eventually became senescent. When these cells were simultaneously treated with a c-ABL kinase inhibitor, STI571, or a c-ABL-specific siRNA along with adriamycin, the p53-dependent p21 induction was dramatically diminished, even though p53 is substantially induced. Accordingly, G2-arrest, and cellular senescence largely dependent on p21 were substantially abrogated. On the contrary, when cells were treated with a relatively high dose of adriamycin (0.4 ìg/ml) cells became apoptotic, and the simultaneous presence of a c-ABL kinase inhibitor STI571 augmented the extent of apoptosis. We speculate this is due to abrogation of p53-dependent p21 induction, which leads to elimination of anti-apoptotic function of p21. In summary, c-ABL appears to promote senescence or inhibit apoptosis, depending on the extent of DNA damage. These findings suggest that the combined use of ABL kinase inhibitor and DNA damaging drug in chemotherapy against tumors retaining wild type p53 should be carefully designed.","['Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl', 'Pyrimidines', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",24177958,"[['G04.146.954.035'], ['D02.065.277', 'D02.241.223.100.100', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.085'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['D12.644.360.225.500', 'D12.776.157.687.250', 'D12.776.167.187.500', 'D12.776.476.225.500', 'D12.776.624.776.355.500', 'D12.776.660.720.250'], ['G05.200'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['G04.144.109.500', 'G04.144.500.340.500'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.065.277.456', 'D02.241.223.100.100.435', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.085.465', 'D03.383.606.405', 'D03.383.742.349'], ['D03.383.606'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.500', 'D12.776.624.664.700.167'], ['D03.383.742'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
20119,"Polymorphisms in ABCG2, ABCC3 and CNT1 genes and their possible impact on chemotherapy outcome of lung cancer patients.","The prognosis of lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is poor, motivating the search for predictive factors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in membrane transporter genes could influence the pharmacokinetics of cytostatic drugs and therefore affect treatment outcome. We examined 6 SNPs with known or suspected phenotypic effect: ABCG2 G34A, C421A; ABCC3 C-211T, G3890A, C3942T and CNT1 G565A. For 349 Caucasian patients with primary lung cancer [161 small cell lung cancer (SCLC), 187 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 1 mixed] receiving first-line chemotherapy 3 different endpoints were analyzed: response after the 2nd cycle (R), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The prognostic value of the SNPs was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (ORs) when comparing genotype frequencies in responders and nonresponders after the 2nd cycle. Hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS and for OS were calculated using Cox regression methods. In all lung cancer patients, none of the investigated polymorphisms modified response statistically significant. The only significant result in the histological subpopulations was in SCLC patients carrying the ABCC3 -211T allele who showed significantly worsened PFS (HR: 1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-2.82). In an exploratory subgroup analysis significantly worse OS was seen for carriers of the ABCG2 421A-allele treated with platinum-based drugs (HR: 1.60; 95% CI 1.04-2.47; n = 256). In conclusion, this study prioritizes ABCC3 C-211T and ABCG2 C421A as candidate transporter SNPs to be further investigated as possible predictors of the clinical outcome of chemotherapy in lung cancer patients.","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",19107936,"[['D12.776.157.530.100.228.500', 'D12.776.395.550.020.457.500', 'D12.776.543.550.192.457.500', 'D12.776.543.585.100.228.500'], ['D12.776.157.530.100', 'D12.776.395.550.020', 'D12.776.543.550.192', 'D12.776.543.585.100'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['G07.690.773.984.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['D12.776.157.530', 'D12.776.543.585'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D12.776.157.530.100.304', 'D12.776.157.530.450.074.500.500.500', 'D12.776.543.585.100.304', 'D12.776.543.585.450.074.500.500.500'], ['D12.776.624'], ['E01.789.625'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['E01.789'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
1184,Heritability of biochemical kidney markers and relation to survival in the elderly--results from a Danish population-based twin study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: We performed a twin study to assess the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to serum levels of urea, creatinine, urate and sodium in a population of 688 elderly twins (73-95 years). Furthermore, we tested the association between these biochemical values and mortality to examine the consequence of an abnormal biochemical kidney parameter in an aging population.RESULTS: A third to a half of the variation in the biochemical kidney tests is due to genetic factors except for creatinine in males. Survival analysis show that all four parameters influence mortality and values below reference interval for urea and urate have a more pronounced impact on survival [hazard ratios (95% confidence interval): 2.32 (1.03-5.26) and 3.56 (1.46-8.69), respectively] than values above [1.20 (0.87-1.64) and 1.50 (1.11-2.02), respectively]. Increased creatinine (above 130 micromol/l) and decreased sodium (below 136 mmol/l) also have a significant impact on survival with hazard ratios on 1.83 (1.13-2.95) and 1.56 (1.22-1.99), respectively. Between 5% and 44% of the measured values are outside the established reference interval.CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the importance of genetic factors in determining the biochemical kidney parameters in an aging population. Furthermore, our data shows that abnormal kidney parameters are common in older adults and results in a significant increase in mortality risk.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Algorithms', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Urea Nitrogen', 'Body Mass Index', 'Creatinine', 'Denmark', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Sodium', 'Survival', 'Survival Analysis', 'Twins', 'Uric Acid']",15469867,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['F01.145.317.269'], ['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['D23.101'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.115', 'E01.370.390.400.100', 'E05.200.124.100.115'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['Z01.542.816.124'], ['G16.500.275', 'N06.230'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A05.810.453'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['I03.784'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['M01.438.873'], ['D03.132.960.877', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824.877']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
1211,Prognostic impact of ALDH1 in breast cancer: a story of stem cells and tumor microenvironment.,"The concept of cancer cells being hierarchically organized and arising from their own progenitor stem cells will have important implications on cancer therapy. If this hypothesis were to be true then the paucity of estrogen receptors in stem cells as well as their inherent drug resistance mechanisms pose a challenge to current targeted therapies. In this study, we sought to examine the prognostic relevance of ALDH1, a putative cancer stem cell marker, by immunohistochemistry. The four cohorts analyzed included an adjuvantly treated series of 245 invasive cancers, a neoadjuvantly treated series of 34 cases, and two series of 58 and 40 triple negative cases, respectively. Both tumor cell and stromal expression for ALDH1 was evaluated, where possible. Tumor cell ALDH1 expression significantly correlated only with basal-like and HER2 tumor types in the adjuvant series and tumor grade in the neoadjuvant cohort. No significant enrichment for ALDH1 positive cells was observed in the postneoadjuvant therapy specimens compared to pretreatment samples. On the other hand, high degree of stromal expression was significantly associated with best disease-free survival as well as a trend for overall survival. The association of stromal expression was confirmed in an independent cohort of triple negative cases. The novel finding is that tumor microenvironment may play a significant role in determining the prognostic impact of stem/progenitor cells in human breast tumors.","['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Isoenzymes', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Receptors, Progesterone', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",19911270,"[['D08.811.682.657.163.249'], ['D08.811.682.657.163.249.188'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['E02.186.170', 'E02.319.170'], ['A11.284.295.310'], ['G05.297'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['E02.186.450'], ['E01.789.625'], ['A11.872.650'], ['E01.789'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074.400', 'D12.776.624.664.700.642', 'D23.050.301.500.600.700', 'D23.050.705.552.600.550', 'D23.101.140.642'], ['D12.776.826.750.350', 'D12.776.930.778.350'], ['D12.776.826.750.765'], ['D08.811.682.657.163.249.875', 'D12.776.331.915', 'D12.776.556.579.374.687'], ['E05.588.570.850']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
5520,Intraductal collagenase delivery into the human pancreas using syringe loading or controlled perfusion.,"Effective intraductal delivery of the enzyme collagenase into the pancreas is crucial to the subsequent ability to isolate viable islets. Most clinical islet transplant centers load the enzyme into the pancreas by retrograde injection using a syringe following cannulation of the pancreatic duct. An alternative approach is to perfuse the pancreas via the pancreatic duct with collagenase solution using a recirculating perfusion device system. This provides control over perfusion pressures and collagenase temperature. This study reports on our evaluation of the delivery of Liberase-HI into the pancreas of 14 consecutive adult multiorgan cadaveric donors. Alternate glands were procured and processed using an identical protocol with the exception of collagenase delivery. The first group of pancreases was loaded using the perfusion technique where cold (4 degrees C) Liberase-HI was perfused at 80 mmHg for 5 min after which the pressure was increased to 180 mmHg. The collagenase solution was then slowly warmed to 35 degrees C, transferred to the dissociation chamber and mechanically dissociated, and then purified using discontinuous gradients of Ficoll. Pancreases in the second group were loaded with collagenase (28-32 degrees C) using the syringe technique before mechanical dissociation and purification. There were no significant differences in pancreas cold ischemia, donor age, body mass index, maximum blood glucose, or serum amylase of the donors between the two groups. Mean collagenase digestion time in the digestion chamber was not different between the two groups; however, the amount of undigested tissue remaining after dissociation was significantly higher in the syringe-loaded group (15.3 +/- 2.6 g vs. 4.6 +/- 2.1 g, mean +/- SEM, p < 0.05). Postdigestion recovery of islets was 471 +/- 83 x 10(3) IE in the perfusion group compared with 391 +/- 57 x 10(3) IE for the syringe-loaded group. Postpurification recovery was higher in the perfused group (379 +/- 45 vs. 251 +/- 28 x 10(3) IE, p < 0.05, two-tailed paired t-test). No difference in in vitro islet viability was observed between the two groups following glucose perifusion with the calculated stimulation index of 4.6 +/- 0.6 for the perfusion group and 4.2 +/- 0.7 for the syringe-loaded group. Controlled perfusion via the pancreatic duct allows the effective delivery of the enzyme achieving maximal distension to all regions of the pancreas leading to an increased recovery of the islets with no detrimental effect on subsequent in vitro islet function.","['Adenosine', 'Adult', 'Allopurinol', 'Brain Death', 'Cadaver', 'Cell Separation', 'Collagenases', 'Glutathione', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'Organ Preservation Solutions', 'Pancreatic Ducts', 'Perfusion', 'Raffinose', 'Thermolysin', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Preservation']",10442741,"[['D03.633.100.759.590.138', 'D13.570.583.138', 'D13.570.800.096'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D03.633.100.759.160'], ['C10.228.140.151', 'C10.597.606.358.800.200.100', 'C23.550.260.159'], ['C23.550.260.224'], ['E01.370.225.500.363', 'E05.200.500.363', 'E05.242.363'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.205', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.205'], ['D12.644.456.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['A03.734.414', 'A06.300.414'], ['D26.776.675'], ['A03.734.667'], ['E05.680'], ['D09.698.629.802.700'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.827', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.827'], ['M01.898'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760', 'E02.792.833', 'E05.200.500.620.760', 'E05.200.750.600.760', 'E05.760.833']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

8531,Diffusion-weighted imaging characteristics of biopsy-proven demyelinating brain lesions.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe lesional diffusion-weighted imaging characteristics in a cohort of patients with biopsy-proven CNS inflammatory demyelinating disease (IDD) and compare diffusion characteristics of ring-enhancing CNS IDD lesions vs abscesses and tumors.METHODS: Forty prebiopsy apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were reviewed from 30 patients with CNS IDD. Lesions were analyzed for size, T2-weighted (T2W) hypointense rim, enhancement, and ADC pattern. ADC patterns of CNS IDD ring-enhancing lesions were compared with a published cohort of 35 patients with ring-enhancing tumors and abscesses.RESULTS: IDD lesions displayed a spectrum of peripheral ADC patterns at the lesion edge: restricted diffusion (low ADC), 33%; increased diffusion (high ADC), 60%; and normal diffusion (homogeneously isointense), 7%. Of biopsied lesions, 93% enhanced (ring, 52%; heterogeneous, 34%; homogeneous, 7%). A hypointense T2W rim was observed in 53%. A ring pattern on ADC (isointense or dark) was associated with T2W hypointense rims (p = 0.02) but not with ring enhancement. On serial imaging, 4 of 7 (57%) patients demonstrated changes in ADC patterns. Peripheral restriction was more common in IDD (p = 0.006) than in tumors or abscesses, whereas central restriction was only observed in abscesses. Restricted lesions in the same stage were more common in the non-IDD cohort (42% vs 20%), with a uniform restricted pattern seen only in abscesses.CONCLUSIONS: In ring-enhancing lesions, peripheral diffusion restriction is more common in IDD than in tumors/abscesses, whereas central restriction is more common among abscesses. Rapid ADC pattern changes in IDD probably reflect dynamic lesion evolution and may distinguish IDD from tumors.","['Abscess', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Young Adult']",22573639,"[['C01.830.025', 'C23.550.470.756.100'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C10.314'], ['E01.370.350.825.500.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.470'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.370.850', 'N05.715.360.325.730', 'N06.850.520.445.850'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
220,"Psychiatric comorbidity and 30-day readmissions after hospitalization for heart failure, AMI, and pneumonia.","OBJECTIVE: In 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented a policy that penalizes hospitals for ""excessive"" all-cause hospital readmissions within 30 days after discharge from an index hospitalization for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and pneumonia. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of psychiatric comorbidities on 30-day all-cause readmissions following hospitalizations for HF, AMI, and pneumonia.METHODS: Data from 2009-2011 were derived from the HMO Research Network Virtual Data Warehouse of 11 health systems affiliated with the Mental Health Research Network. All index inpatient hospitalizations for HF, AMI, and pneumonia were captured (N=160,169). Psychiatric diagnoses for the year prior to admission were measured. All-cause readmissions within 30 days of discharge were the outcome variable.RESULTS: Approximately 18% of all individuals with index inpatient hospitalizations for HF, AMI, and pneumonia were readmitted within 30 days. The rate of readmission was 5% greater for individuals with a psychiatric comorbidity compared with those without a psychiatric comorbidity (21.7% and 16.5%, respectively, p<.001). Depression, anxiety, and dementia were associated with more readmissions of persons with index hospitalizations for each general medical condition and for all the conditions combined (p<.05). Substance use and bipolar disorders were linked with higher readmissions for those with initial hospitalizations for HF and pneumonia (p<.05). Readmission rates declined overall from 2009 to 2011.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with HF, AMI, and pneumonia experience high rates of readmission, but psychiatric comorbidities appear to increase that risk. Future interventions to reduce readmission should consider adding mental health components.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Heart Failure', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Readmission', 'Pneumonia', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",25642610,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['C14.280.434'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F03'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['E02.760.400.620', 'N02.421.585.400.620'], ['C01.748.610', 'C08.381.677', 'C08.730.610'], ['G01.910.857'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
9158,Iteratively reweighted LASSO for mapping multiple quantitative trait loci.,"The iteratively reweighted least square (IRLS) method is mostly identical to maximum likelihood (ML) method in terms of parameter estimation and power of quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection. But the IRLS is greatly superior to ML in terms of computing speed and the robustness of parameter estimation. In conjunction with the priors of parameters, ML can analyze multiple QTL model based on Bayesian theory, whereas under a single QTL model, IRLS has very limited statistical power to detect multiple QTLs. In this study, we proposed the iteratively reweighted least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (IRLASSO) for extending IRLS to simultaneously map multiple QTLs. The LASSO with coordinate descent step is employed to efficiently estimate non-zero genetic effect of each locus scanned over entire genome. Simulations demonstrate that IRLASSO has a higher precision of parameter estimation and power to detect QTL than IRLS, and is able to estimate residual variance more accurately than the unweighted LASSO based on LS. Especially, IRLASSO is very fast, usually taking less than five iterations to converge. The barley dataset from the North American Barley Genome Mapping Project is reanalyzed by our proposed method.","['Bayes Theorem', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Genome, Plant', 'Hordeum', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Models, Genetic', 'Quantitative Trait Loci']",23023740,"[['E05.318.740.600.200', 'N05.715.360.750.625.150', 'N06.850.520.830.600.200'], ['E05.393.183'], ['H01.158.273.180', 'L01.313.124'], ['L01.224.160'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400.325', 'L01.470.750.750.325'], ['G05.360.340.365'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.481'], ['E05.318.740.750.400', 'N05.715.360.750.695.440', 'N06.850.520.830.750.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.475', 'E05.318.740.600.400', 'E05.599.835.500', 'N05.715.360.750.530.450', 'N05.715.360.750.625.450', 'N06.850.520.830.500.475', 'N06.850.520.830.600.400'], ['E05.599.395.397'], ['G05.360.340.024.380.937']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
39169,A hypothesis to explain childhood cancers near nuclear power plants.,"Over 60 epidemiological studies world-wide have examined cancer incidences in children near nuclear power plants (NPPs): most of them indicate leukemia increases. These include the 2008 KiKK study commissioned by the German Government which found relative risks (RR) of 1.6 in total cancers and 2.2 in leukemias among infants living within 5 km of all German NPPs. The KiKK study has retriggered the debate as to the cause(s) of these increased cancers. A suggested hypothesis is that the increased cancers arise from radiation exposures to pregnant women near NPPs. However any theory has to account for the >10,000 fold discrepancy between official dose estimates from NPP emissions and observed increased risks. An explanation may be that doses from spikes in NPP radionuclide emissions are significantly larger than those estimated by official models which are diluted through the use of annual averages. In addition, risks to embryos/fetuses are greater than those to adults and haematopoietic tissues appear more radiosensitive in embryos/fetuses than in newborn babies. The product of possible increased doses and possible increased risks per dose may provide an explanation.","['Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasms', 'Nuclear Power Plants', 'Pregnancy']",24054083,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['C04'], ['E07.710.600.500', 'J01.780.600', 'J03.540.680.600'], ['G08.686.784.769']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
16806,The Accuracy and Feasibility of Robotic Assisted Lead Implantation in Nonhuman Primates.,"OBJECTIVES: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) electrode implantation are the most important and frequent manipulations in nonhuman primates (NHP) neuromodulation research. However, traditional methods tend to be arduous and inaccurate.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve adult male rhesus monkeys were selected for the study, with six subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS, six anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) DBS and six hippocampus-SEEG (Hippo-SEEG) electrodes implantation. Mean Euclidean errors of entrance and the target were calculated by postoperative image fusion, and the correlation between entrance and target error, as well as the differences among the various manipulations, were analyzed. The accuracy of target was further confirmed by gross anatomy examination. Moreover, the time consumption was recorded.RESULTS: The mean (±SD) Euclidean errors of the target point and entry point of the three manipulations were STN-DBS: 1.05 ± 0.54 mm and 0.52 ± 0.17 mm; ANT-DBS: 1.12 ± 0.74 mm and 0.58 ± 0.24 mm; and Hippo-SEEG: 2.68 ± 1.03 mm and 1.47 ± 0.63 mm. Significant differences were observed in both target and entry point errors between the DBS and Hippo-SEEG groups, with superior accuracy in the DBS group. The entrance errors had a significantly positive correlation with the target errors in the STN-DBS and Hippo-SEEG groups. Moreover, the time consumption in robotic surgery was much shorter than that in the traditional method, without any severe complications.CONCLUSION: The application of robot-assisted lead implantation in NHP neuromodulation research is feasible, accurate, safe, and efficient, and can prospectively be beneficial to neurological studies.","['Animals', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Electrodes, Implanted', 'Electroencephalography', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Robotic Surgical Procedures']",31012530,"[['B01.050'], ['E02.331.300', 'E04.190'], ['E07.305.250.319', 'E07.695.202'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.510.550'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E04.749.500', 'J01.897.104.834.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
31670,Uric acid improves glucose-driven oxidative stress in human ischemic stroke.,"OBJECTIVE: A study was undertaken to test in a subgroup reanalysis of the URICO-ICTUS trial whether uric acid is superior to placebo in improving the functional outcome in patients with acute stroke and hyperglycemia.METHODS: Patients were part of the URICO-ICTUS trial, a double-blind study that compared the administration of uric acid versus placebo in stroke patients treated with alteplase within 4.5 hours of onset. The effect of therapy on the rate of excellent outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale ? 2) in each tertile of admission glucose was assessed with multivariate adjusted models in 409 of the 421 randomized patients who had available pretreatment glucose levels. The effect of therapy on infarct growth was assessed in 72 patients who had longitudinal multimodal brain imaging.RESULTS: Uric acid was associated with an increased rate of excellent outcome in patients with glucose levels in the upper tertile range (odds ratio [OR] = 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-8.3). However, the effect was not apparent for patients in the middle tertile (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.8-3.6) or lower tertile of glucose (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.5-2.6). Uric acid therapy was more effective than placebo in limiting infarct growth in the upper tertile range (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.04) but not in the middle tertile (p = 0.95) or lower tertile of glucose (p = 0.30). Uric acid also proved superior to placebo in reducing infarct growth in patients with early recanalization.INTERPRETATION: Uric acid therapy was associated with reduced infarct growth and improved outcome in patients with hyperglycemia during acute stroke.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antioxidants', 'Blood Glucose', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Stroke', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uric Acid']",25627874,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['C10.228.140.300.150', 'C14.907.253.092'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D03.132.960.877', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824.877']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
21253,In vitro NMR proton T1 measurements in peritoneal ascites.,"The proton spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) in malignant and non-malignant ascites was measured with an FT NMR spectrometer operating at 60 MHz. The mean relaxation rate in non-malignant ascites was significantly smaller than that of malignant ascites. However, the 1/T1 of malignant ascites overlaps with that of non-malignant ascites over all concentrations of total protein (TP) in samples. The 1/T1 in non-malignant ascites correlates strongly with TP, whilst the 1/T1 in malignant ascites shows only a moderate correlation. T1 measurements before and after addition of ascorbic acid (reductant) suggest that there is a small paramagnetic contribution of ions to the 1/T1 in malignant ascites. The least-squares fitting of 1/T1 versus TP for non-malignant data gives a linear relationship, and suggests that the T1 mechanism in non-malignant ascites is caused by a fast chemical exchange of water molecules between protein-bound water and free water.","['Ascites', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Copper', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iron', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasms', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proteins', 'Protons']",8778831,"[['C23.550.081'], ['D02.241.081.844.107', 'D02.241.511.902.107', 'D09.811.100'], ['G01.154'], ['H01.158.344', 'H01.671.100'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['D01.268.556.412', 'D01.268.956.287', 'D01.552.544.412'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['D12.776.624'], ['C04'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D12.776'], ['D01.248.497.300.459.700', 'D01.268.406.750', 'D01.362.340.750', 'G01.249.660.500']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
4378,Hypoxemia associated with feeding in the preterm infant and full-term neonate.,"Polygraphic monitoring studies were performed on more than 150 older preterm infants (postconceptional ages of 36 weeks or more) and full-term neonates to evaluate unexplained or persistent apnea. During polygraphic monitoring, 16 infants were observed to have hypoxemia associated with feedings. The feeding hypoxemia was accompanied by irregular respiratory effort and preceded any associated bradycardia. A comparison group of eight infants with similar gestational and postconceptional ages, but without feeding hypoxemia, was selected retrospectively from other infants referred for evaluation of persistent or unexplained apnea. The group with feeding hypoxemia showed evidence of CNS compromise as manifested by significant elevations of the maximum end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure during sleep and abnormal computed tomograms (7/11 v 0/5 in the comparison group). There was no relationship between feeding hypoxemia and sleep apnea or gastroesophageal reflux. Clinical follow-up showed that the feeding hypoxemia resolved with maturation.","['Apnea', 'Bottle Feeding', 'Bradycardia', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature, Diseases', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Respiratory Center', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sleep, REM']",6428217,"[['C08.618.085', 'C23.888.852.130'], ['E02.421.150', 'F01.145.407.099', 'G07.203.650.220.500.250', 'G07.203.650.353.099'], ['C14.280.067.319', 'C23.550.073.300'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.852.079'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['C16.614.521'], ['E01.370.520'], ['A08.186.211.132.772.646'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['F02.830.855.796.671', 'G11.561.803.754.671']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
6159,Can alterations in integrin and laminin-5 expression be used as markers of malignancy?,"Development of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) involves alterations in the adhesive interactions in the epithelium and invasion through the basement membrane. Therefore, changes in the expression of receptors and ligands involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion may be essential for the transformation of a premalignant into a malignant lesion. The aim of this study was to examine if expression of specific cell adhesion molecules can be used as markers of malignant development. By immunohistochemistry, we examined the expression pattern of integrins alpha2beta1, alpha3beta1, alpha6beta4 and laminin-5 in biopsies from SCCs (n=18), premalignant lesions (leukoplakias, n=21) and non-premalignant tissue with chronic inflammation (n=11). In poorly differentiated SCCs, patchy loss of alpha3beta1, alpha6beta4 and laminin-5 expression was pronounced at the invasion front, whereas there was a tendency to increased expression of alpha2beta1. Analogous to the SCCs, biopsies from the leukoplakias and the non-premalignant inflammatory tissue showed alterations of the expression of alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 in the basal cell layers and of laminin-5. However, a characteristic finding in biopsies from leukoplakias was loss of alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 in the suprabasal cells.

44413,Evaluation of carbon dioxide induction methods for the euthanasia of day-old cull broiler chicks.,"This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 5 different CO2 euthanasia induction techniques for day-old cull chicks in minimizing distress and inducing a rapid loss of sensibility and death. Each induction treatment was characterized for concentration change over time, maximum concentration, and time to reach maximum. Sixteen chicks were euthanized with the gradual treatments to establish validity of treatment. Then, all 5 treatments were evaluated for effect on distress, insensibility, and death. Day-of-hatch cull chicks (n = 110) were euthanized in pairs by either immersion into 100% CO2 or gradual induction to 100% CO2 at displacement rates of 7, 14, 21, or 28% of chamber volume added per min (% vol/min). CO2 concentration was measured at chick level. Live focal observations and video recordings were used to assess latency to behavioral responses: head shaking (HS) and gasping (GS) as indicators of distress; loss of posture (LOP) as an indicator of insensibility; and cessation of rhythmic breathing (CRB) and movement (COM), indicating death. All behaviors occurred at the earliest with immersion compared to gradual treatments, and time between first signs of distress and LOP was shorter for immersion than gradual treatments. Gradual treatments showed a linear decrease in latency to HS, GS, and LOP as displacement rate increased. Latency to CRB decreased quadratically with increasing displacement rate, while COM decreased linearly. Within gradual treatments, HS and GS occurred at CO2 concentrations between 0.43 and 1.14%, LOP between 11.1 and 17.5%, while CRB and COM occurred between 61.8 and 78.4%. Overall, immersion induced distress, insensibility, and death significantly faster and with the shortest interval between distress and insensibility. For gradual treatment, insensibility and death occurred faster with increasing displacement rates. Behavioral signs of distress were observed with all treatments, and occurred at concentrations lower than those causing insensibility. In conclusion, immersion into 100% CO2 environment resulted in the shortest time of distress and fastest time to death compared to gradual displacement rates of any speed measured.","['Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Chickens', 'Euthanasia, Animal', 'Female', 'Male', 'Random Allocation']",30624707,"[['I01.880.604.100'], ['B01.050'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['E02.760.905.199.249.750', 'E05.335', 'N02.421.585.905.199.500.750'], ['E05.318.370.700', 'E05.581.500.805', 'N05.715.360.325.675', 'N06.850.520.445.700']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
28804,"Light regulates attachment, exopolysaccharide production, and nodulation in Rhizobium leguminosarum through a LOV-histidine kinase photoreceptor.","Rhizobium leguminosarum is a soil bacterium that infects root hairs and induces the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules on leguminous plants. Light, oxygen, and voltage (LOV)-domain proteins are blue-light receptors found in higher plants and many algae, fungi, and bacteria. The genome of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841, a pea-nodulating endosymbiont, encodes a sensor histidine kinase containing a LOV domain at the N-terminal end (R-LOV-HK). R-LOV-HK has a typical LOV domain absorption spectrum with broad bands in the blue and UV-A regions and shows a truncated photocycle. Here we show that the R-LOV-HK protein regulates attachment to an abiotic surface and production of flagellar proteins and exopolysaccharide in response to light. Also, illumination of bacterial cultures before inoculation of pea roots increases the number of nodules per plant and the number of intranodular bacteroids. The effects of light on nodulation are dependent on a functional lov gene. The results presented in this work suggest that light, sensed by R-LOV-HK, is an important environmental factor that controls adaptive responses and the symbiotic efficiency of R. leguminosarum.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Base Sequence', 'Biofilms', 'Blotting, Western', 'Flagella', 'Gentian Violet', 'Histidine Kinase', 'Light', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peas', 'Photoreceptors, Microbial', 'Plant Root Nodulation', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial', 'Protein Kinases', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rhizobium leguminosarum', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Symbiosis']",22773814,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G06.099.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['A20.593', 'G06.120'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A11.284.180.290'], ['D02.092.146.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.424'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.401.630'], ['D12.776.752'], ['G15.682'], ['D09.698.718', 'D23.050.161.616'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['E05.393.620.500.706'], ['B03.440.400.425.700.800.450', 'B03.585.900.450', 'B03.660.050.662.670.450'], ['E05.393.751'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['G06.550.800', 'G16.840']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
28091,31p nuclear relaxation studies of para- and diamagnetic cobalamins in their two isomeric forms.,"A new, naturally occurring isomeric form of vitamin B-12 was reported by us earlier (Katada, M., Tyagi, S., Nath, A., Petersen, R.L. and Gupta, R.K. (1979) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 584, 149-163). The M?ssbauer parameters of various derivatives of vitamin B-12, including the one-electron reduced species, cob(II)-alamin (vitamin B-12r), exhibit differences for the two isomeric forms. This and some other observations from our laboratory indicated that the new form (vitamin B-12') presumably constitutes a conformational isomer possessing a different puckering of the corrin ring. The 31P nuclear relaxation studies of vitamins B-12r and B-12'r, B-12 and B-12', and dicyanocobalamin as compared to dicyanocobalamin' reported here are consistent with our earlier conjecture. The relaxation of the 31P nucleus in cob(II)alamins is primarily due to its dipolar interaction with the paramagnetic cobalt and therefore the measurement of the 31P nuclear relaxation times (T1) in the two isomeric forms permits us to calculate Co(II)-31P distances. The Co(II)-31P distance in vitamin B-12'r is found to be larger than that in vitamin B-12r. The 31P T1 value in the diamagnetic cob(III)-alamins is determined predominantly by its dipolar interaction with the two closest protons flanking the phosphate group, one being situated on the ribose moiety and the other on the amino propanol group. The nuclear relaxation times T1 of cyanocobalamin and dicyanocobalamin differ from ;those of their corresponding conformational isomers. The observed differences in 31P relaxation rates of the para- and diamagnetic cobalamins in their two isomeric forms can be understood on the basis of structural changes arising from variations in the nature of puckering of the corrin ring. The 31P chemical shifts in the two isomers remain essentially unchanged, indicating that the structural differences in the isomeric forms do not alter the electronic environment of the phosphorus nucleus.","['Isomerism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Chemical', 'Vitamin B 12']",7236717,"[['G02.111.570.685', 'G02.607.445'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['E05.599.495'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.437.777', 'D03.633.400.909.437.777', 'D04.345.783.437.777']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
40187,"Structure of the PH domain from Bruton's tyrosine kinase in complex with inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate.","BACKGROUND: The activity of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is important for the maturation of B cells. A variety of point mutations in this enzyme result in a severe human immunodeficiency known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Btk contains a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain that specifically binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and, hence, responds to signalling via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Point mutations in the PH domain might abolish membrane binding, preventing signalling via Btk.RESULTS: We have determined the crystal structures of the wild-type PH domain and a gain-of-function mutant E41K in complex with D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetra-kisphosphate (Ins (1,3,4,5)P4). The inositol Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 binds to a site that is similar to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding site in the PH domain of phospholipase C-delta. A second Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 molecule is associated with the domain of the E41K mutant, suggesting a mechanism for its constitutive interaction with membrane. The affinities of Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 to the wild type (Kd = 40 nM), and several XLA-causing mutants have been measured using isothermal titration calorimetry.CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide an explanation for the specificity and high affinity of the interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and lead to a classification of the XLA mutations that reside in the Btk PH domain. Mis-sense mutations that do not simply destabilize the PH fold either directly affect the interaction with the phosphates of the lipid head group or change electrostatic properties of the lipid-binding site. One point mutation (Q127H) cannot be explained by these facts, suggesting that the PH domain of Btk carries an additional function such as interaction with a Galpha protein.","['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Agammaglobulinemia', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Calorimetry', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'X Chromosome']",10196129,"[['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.025'], ['C15.378.147.142', 'C15.604.515.032', 'C20.673.088'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['E05.393.420.601.035', 'G05.558.109'], ['E05.196.131'], ['E05.196.309.742.225'], ['G02.206', 'G03.230'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.033.800.519.400', 'D09.853.519.400', 'D09.894.480'], ['D10.570'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D10.570.755.375.760.400.942'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['E05.393.751'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997'], ['G02.111.835'], ['A11.284.187.865.982', 'G05.360.162.865.982']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
10485,The interaction of human natural killer cells with either unpolarized or polarized macrophages results in different functional outcomes.,"The cross-talk among cells of the innate immunity can greatly affect both innate and adaptive responses. Here we analyzed the molecular interactions between human natural killer (NK) cells and autologous macrophages. Activated NK cells killed M0 and M2, whereas M1 macrophages were more resistant to lysis because of their higher expression of HLA class I molecules. Following exposure to LPS or bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin, M0 and M2, but not polarized (endotoxin tolerant) M1 macrophages, induced strong activation of resting NK cells. The expression of CD69 and CD25 activation markers and the acquisition of cytotoxicity against tumor cells and immature dendritic cells required soluble factors being mostly contact independent. On the contrary, IFN-ã production was contact dependent and required the interaction of DNAM-1 and 2B4 (on NK) with their ligands on macrophages as well as IL-18. IL-18 was involved also in the acquisition of CCR7 by NK cells. Interestingly, M0 and M2 cells expressed a membrane-bound form of IL-18, which was released in small amounts after LPS treatment. Our data indicate that, upon interaction with M0 macrophages exposed to microbial products, NK cells may amplify classical type 1 immune responses. In addition, M1-polarizing stimuli can rescue M2 macrophages from their immunomodulatory state and shape their functional behavior toward NK stimulatory capability.","['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophages', 'Receptors, CCR7']",21118979,"[['D23.050.301.264.035', 'D23.101.100.110'], ['D23.050.301.264.894', 'D23.101.100.894'], ['G04.250'], ['A11.251'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.610.595', 'G05.360.340.024.380.500.595', 'G12.500.500.595'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.420.320.500'], ['A11.251.210.190.510', 'A11.251.860.180.510', 'A11.443.240.497.480'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.537', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.537', 'A15.382.490.555.567.537'], ['D12.776.503.280'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.160.150.700', 'D12.776.543.750.705.852.125.150.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25287,Laparoscopic inguinal preperitoneal injection--novel technique for inguinal hernia repair: preliminary results of experimental study.,"BACKGROUND: Inguinal hernia repair is the most common procedure in pediatric surgery. Suture techniques for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in children are easy to perform and popular with a low recurrence rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic preperitoneal injection of three-dimensional gel on closing of the inguinal hernia sac (IHS) in laboratory animals.MATERIALS AND METHODS: With the animals under general anesthesia, we performed peritoneoscopy in 12 male Chinchilla rabbits weighing 1200-1400 g. The endoscope was introduced into the abdominal cavity, and bilateral deep inguinal rings were identified. A Tuohy needle with the injectable polymeric bulking agent DAM+™ (three-dimensional polyacrylamide gel with silver ions [Argiform(®) from Bioform(®)]) was introduced preperitoneally. The implant was then injected across the entire orifice of the deep inguinal rings and draped over the cord structures. After completion of bilateral repairs, the rabbits were extubated and observed in the animal laboratory. Then the second laparoscopy was performed 6 months later, and the deep inguinal rings were inspected.RESULTS: The postoperative course was uneventful in all the animals. At the second laparoscopy no reopening of the entire orifice of the deep inguinal rings was noted. Accurate placement of the polymeric agent and adequate coverage of the vas deferens were accomplished in all the animals.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the biopolymeric implant gives good postoperative results and a stable trend of closing the IHS in long-term follow-up. In conclusion, we hope that injectable polymeric bulking agents can be used for treatment of inguinal hernias of pediatric patients after additional animal and human research.","['Acrylic Resins', 'Animals', 'Chinchilla', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hernia, Inguinal', 'Herniorrhaphy', 'Injections', 'Laparoscopy', 'Male', 'Prostheses and Implants', 'Silver', 'Silver Compounds']",22356207,"[['D05.750.716.822.111', 'D25.720.716.822.111', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.111'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.328'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['C23.300.707.374.875'], ['E04.680.325'], ['E02.319.267.530'], ['E01.370.388.250.520', 'E04.502.250.520'], ['E07.695'], ['D01.268.556.812', 'D01.268.956.843', 'D01.552.544.812'], ['D01.847']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

However, prolonged exposure to high oxygen concentrations can readily lead to diffuse nonspecific inflammation, which promotes airway remodeling and pulmonary fibrosis. The Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (Rho/ROCK) signaling pathway plays an important role in numerous developmental and proliferative diseases. This study was performed to determine the efficacy of ROCK inhibitor fasudil in blocking the development of hyperoxia-induced lung injury and fibrosis in neonatal rats.METHODS: Neonatal rats were randomly divided into four groups: air + saline group, air + fasudil group, hyperoxia + saline group, and hyperoxia + fasudil group. The hyperoxia + saline and Hyp + fasudil groups were exposed to 95% oxygen for 21 days and administered intraperitoneal saline or fasudil once daily. The air + saline and air + fasudil group were exposed to 21% oxygen (room air) and administered the same volume of intraperitoneal saline or fasudil.RESULTS: Fasudil-treated rats exhibited improved histopathological changes and decreased lung hydroxyproline content. Fasudil attenuated the protein level of alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor-â1, and connective tissue growth factor. Additionally, fasudil reduced the activation of ROCK1 and myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 protein in the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway.CONCLUSIONS: Fasudil may be a potentially effective therapeutic drug for hyperoxia-induced pulmonary fibrosis.","['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Blotting, Western', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Hyperoxia', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'rho-Associated Kinases']",26722398,"[['D02.886.590.700.545', 'D03.383.606.527', 'D03.633.100.531.400'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['C23.888.852.567'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['D27.505.519.389.755'], ['C08.381.765'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.814', 'D12.644.360.590', 'D12.776.476.595']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
6588,Teicoplanin: Part 1. An evaluation of the concentrations seen in serum and the subcutaneous fat of the relatively ischaemic lower limb following a single intravenous bolus.,"Teicoplanin is a new antibiotic currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Consecutive patients undergoing elective vascular surgery (n = 28) were randomised to receive a single intravenous bolus of 400 mg teicoplanin 1, 3, 6 or 12 h prior to surgery as prophylaxis against Gram-positive infection. Serum and fat antibiotic levels were measured and found to exceed the established MICs for common staphylococcal and streptococcal infections for at least 12 h following administration. This suggests that teicoplanin would be a useful choice of antibiotic in the prophylaxis and treatment of appropriate infections in elective surgery. By extrapolation, teicoplanin would also be of use in the prophylaxis and treatment of suitable infections seen in traumatised patients.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Glycopeptides', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Teicoplanin']",2526008,"[['A10.165.114'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['D09.400.420', 'D12.644.233'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.082.750', 'E02.319.267.530.540'], ['C23.550.513'], ['A01.378.610.500'], ['G09.330.100.780'], ['D09.400.420.405.500', 'D12.644.233.352.500']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This transformation proceeds via base-mediated deprotonation, ortho-lithiation, and intramolecular cyclization to provide unstable lithiated benzoxazole moieties. The subsequent in-line electrophilic quench results in the formation of substituted benzoxazoles in high yield and quality. Continuous flow technology allowed for accurate temperature control and immediate in-line quench while minimizing the hold-up time for the unstable lithiated intermediates thereby minimizing associated byproduct formation.","['Aniline Compounds', 'Benzoxazoles', 'Catalysis', 'Cyclization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Stereoisomerism']",24147774,"[['D02.092.146'], ['D03.633.100.221'], ['G02.130'], ['G02.111.180', 'G02.607.133', 'G03.208'], ['G02.111.570', 'G02.466'], ['G02.607.445.682']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
10553,Discovery of novel pyrazolopyrimidinone analogs as potent inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type-5.,"Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) specific phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE5), a clinically proven target to treat erectile dysfunction and diseases associated with lower cGMP levels in humans, is present in corpus cavernosum, heart, lung, platelets, prostate, urethra, bladder, liver, brain, and stomach. Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil and avanafil are FDA approved drugs in market as PDE5 inhibitors for treating erectile dysfunction. In the present study a lead molecule 4-ethoxy-N-(6-hydroxyhexyl)-3-(1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-6,7-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)benzenesulfonamide, that is, compound-4a, an analog of pyrazolopyrimidinone scaffold has been identified as selective PDE5 inhibitor. A series of compounds was synthesized by replacing N-methylpiperazine moiety (ring-C) of sildenafil structure with different N-substitutions towards sulfonamide end. Compound-4a showed lower IC₅₀ value (1.5 nM) against PDE5 than parent sildenafil (5.6 nM) in in vitro enzyme assay. The isoform selectivity of the compound-4a against other PDE isoforms was similar to that of the Sildenafil. In corroboration with the in vitro data, this molecule showed better efficacy in in vivo studies using the conscious rabbit model. Also compound-4a exhibited good physicochemical properties like solubility, caco-2 permeability, cLogP along with optimal PK profile having no significant CYP enzyme inhibitory liabilities. Discovery of these novel bioactive compounds may open a new alternative for developing novel preclinical candidates based on this drugable scaffold.","['Animals', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 5', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Discovery', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles', 'Pyrimidinones', 'Rabbits', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",25801159,"[['B01.050'], ['D08.811.277.352.640.150.500', 'D08.811.277.352.640.155.500', 'D12.644.360.008.500', 'D12.644.360.009.500', 'D12.776.476.008.500', 'D12.776.476.009.500'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.295', 'H01.158.703.007.675', 'H01.181.466.675'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['G02.111.570', 'G02.466'], ['D27.505.519.389.735.500'], ['D03.383.129.539'], ['D03.383.742.698'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
7833,The 5-D itch scale: a new measure of pruritus.,"BACKGROUND: Itching is a subjective and multidimensional experience which is difficult to quantify. Most methodologies to assess itching suffer from being unidimensional, for example only measuring intensity without impact on quality of life, or only measuring scratching activity. None has actually been demonstrated to be able to detect change over time, which is essential to using them as an outcome measure of response to an intervention. The 5-D itch scale was developed as a brief but multidimensional questionnaire designed to be useful as an outcome measure in clinical trials. The five dimensions are degree, duration, direction, disability and distribution.OBJECTIVES: To study the 5-D with respect to validity, reliability and response to change.METHODS: The 5-D was administered to 234 individuals with chronic pruritus due to liver disease (n = 63), kidney disease (n = 36), dermatological disorders (n = 56), HIV/AIDS (n = 28) and burn injuries (n = 51). The 5-D was administered at baseline and after a 6-week follow-up period. A subset of 50 untreated patients was retested after 3 days to assess test-retest reliability.RESULTS: The 5-D score correlated strongly with a visual analogue score: r = 0.727 at baseline (P < 0.0001), r = 0.868 at the 3-day repeat (P < 0.0001), and r = 0.892 at the 6-week follow-up (P < 0.0001). There was no change in mean 5-D score between day 1 and day 3 in untreated individuals (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96, P < 0.0001). The 5-D did, however, detect significant changes in pruritus over the 6-week follow-up period (P < 0.0001). Subanalysis of the different patient groups revealed similar response patterns and scores, with the exception of lower total scores for the burn victims due to lower scores on the distribution domain because they itched only at the site of their burn.CONCLUSIONS: The 5-D, therefore, is a reliable, multidimensional measure of itching that has been validated in patients with chronic pruritus to able to detect changes over time. The 5-D should be useful as an outcome measure in clinical trials.","['Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pruritus', 'Quality of Life', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",19995367,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['E01.370.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C17.800.685', 'C23.888.885.625'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E05.318.740', 'H01.548.832', 'N05.715.360.750', 'N06.850.520.830'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
8577,Consequences of prolonged inhalation of ozone on F344/N rats: collaborative studies. Part III: Effects on complex carbohydrates of lung connective tissue.,"Glycosaminoglycans are constituents of proteoglycans, which are integral components of lung connective tissue. Glycosaminoglycans not only provide structural support to organs, but also influence extracellular matrix assembly, cell adhesion, and cell proliferation. Changes in the metabolism of glycosaminoglycans have been noted in several pulmonary diseases, for example, pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. We studied quantitative and qualitative changes of glycosaminoglycans in the lungs of rats exposed to a range of ozone levels (0, 0.12, 0.5, 1.0 parts per million) for 20 months. Glycosaminoglycans were isolated from dry-defatted lung tissues through successive digestions by pronase, papain, and 2 M sodium hydroxide. The glycosaminoglycans then were fractionated into individual components using high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of total glycosaminoglycans in the tissues varied from 1.5 to 4.2 micrograms of uronate/mg of dry-defatted tissue. Although wide variations in total glycosaminoglycan concentrations exist among individual animals within each exposure group, regression analyses of data indicate a monotonic and statistically significant decrease of total glycosaminoglycans after ozone exposure (p = 0.02). Among individual glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronan, chondroitin 4-sulfate, and chondroitin 6-sulfate levels decreased significantly (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively) in animals exposed to ozone when compared with control animals. Heparan sulfate concentration exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) trend toward increase with increasing doses of ozone, but the difference in heparan sulfate concentration between ozone-exposed animals and control animals was not significant. Gel filtration studies of glycosaminoglycans in pooled samples indicated that the molecular size of hyaluronan in animals exposed to ozone was lower than it was in control animals. We noted differences in heparan sulfate's chemical properties and affinity to antithrombin III in ozone-exposed animals and control animals. Although these studies do not provide the mechanism responsible for the observed changes in the lung glycosaminoglycans in ozone-exposed animals, the observations indicate that inhalation of ozone for 20 months affects normal cellular metabolism of proteoglycans, which may contribute to the functional impairment of the lung.","['Animals', 'Antithrombin III', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Connective Tissue', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Heparitin Sulfate', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Ozone', 'Proteoglycans', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",7811421,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.644.861.060.500', 'D12.776.124.790.106.125', 'D12.776.377.715.085.125', 'D12.776.872.060.500', 'D23.113.025'], ['D09'], ['E05.196.181.400.170'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['A10.165'], ['N06.850.460.350'], ['D09.698.373'], ['D09.698.373.425'], ['A04.411'], ['D01.362.670.600'], ['D09.698.735', 'D12.776.395.650'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.200', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.200']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We measured the bile duct sphincter in seven persons and the pancreatic duct sphincter in two. A hydraulic capillary infusion system and a triple-lumen catheter were used. In all the SO was identified as a zone (median length, 8 mm) with elevated base-line pressure and superimposed phasic activity. Median values for amplitude was 102.9 mm Hg; base-line pressure, 10 mm Hg; wave duration, 4.8 sec; and frequency, 2.6/min. Most waves propagated antegrade or simultaneously, and in no individual were more than one third of the waves retrograde. When peak-to-peak intervals were analyzed in one volunteer with prolonged manometry, a basal mode of 6 sec or an even multiple of this value was disclosed, indicating that the SO is paced.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Ampulla of Vater', 'Endoscopy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Manometry', 'Middle Aged', 'Reference Values', 'Sphincter of Oddi']",3576130,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['A03.159.183.079.300.950', 'A03.556.124.684.124.236', 'A03.556.875.249.160', 'A03.734.667.500'], ['E01.370.388.250', 'E04.502.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.559'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.978.810'], ['A03.159.183.079.300.950.600', 'A03.556.124.684.124.236.572', 'A03.556.875.249.160.572']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
34484,Temporal variation and persistence of bacteria in streams.,"Better understanding of bacterial fate and transport in watersheds is necessary for improved regulatory management of impaired streams. Novel statistical time series analyses of coliform data can be a useful tool for evaluating the dynamics of temporal variation and persistence of bacteria within a watershed. For this study, daily total coliform data for the Little River in East Tennessee from 1 Oct. 2000 to 31 Dec. 2005 were evaluated using novel time series techniques. The objective of this study was to analyze the total coliform concentration data to: (i) evaluate the temporal variation of the total coliform, and (ii) determine whether the total coliform concentration data demonstrated any long-term or short-term persistence. For robust analysis and comparison, both time domain and frequency domain approaches were used for the analysis. In the time domain, an autoregressive moving average approach was used; whereas in the frequency domain, spectral analysis was applied. As expected, the analyses showed that total coliform concentrations were higher in summer months and lower in winter months. However, the more interesting results showed that the total coliform concentration exhibited short-term as well as long-term persistence ranging from about 4 wk to approximately 1 yr, respectively. Comparison of the total coliform data to hydrologic data indicated both runoff and baseflow are responsible for the persistence.","['Bacteria', 'Water Microbiology']",18574188,"[['B03'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.777', 'N06.850.425.450']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
21644,Expression of Cu/Zn and Mn superoxide dismutases during bovine embryo development: influence of in vitro culture.,"Temporal pattern of expression of Cu/Zn and Mn superoxide dismutases (SODs) was investigated in bovine oocytes and embryos produced in vitro in two different culture conditions and in vivo after superovulation. SODs were examined at a transcriptional level in single oocytes and embryos by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and, at a protein level, by Western blotting on pools of embryos. mRNA encoding Cu/Zn SOD were detected in in vitro bovine embryos throughout preattachment development as well as in in vivo derived morulae and blastocysts. Transcripts for Mn SOD gene were detected in most immature and in vitro matured oocytes as well as in some zygotes and 5- to 8-cell embryos while no transcript was found at the 9-to 16-cell stage in both culture conditions. In vitro embryonic expression of Mn SOD was detected earlier in the presence of serum. Half of the morulae showed the transcript if cultured with 5% serum while none without serum. At the blastocyst stage Mn SOD could be detected independently of culture conditions. For in vivo-derived embryos Mn SOD transcripts were detected both in morulae and blastocysts. Immunoblotting analyses revealed that Cu/Zn SOD and Mn SOD were also present at a protein level in in vitro-derived zygotes and blastocysts. Together these data demonstrate, for the first time, that Mn SOD is transcribed and that Cu/Zn and Mn SOD proteins are expressed in preimplantation bovine embryos. Finally, they suggest that Mn SOD transcription is altered by in vitro culture conditions.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Fallopian Tubes', 'Female', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Transcription, Genetic']",11144220,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A11.251'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['G07.345.500.325', 'G08.686.784.170'], ['A05.360.319.114.373', 'A13.706.500'], ['D27.505.519.217.500'], ['E05.481'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['D08.811.682.881'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Careful examination of the tumor showed no evidence of ovarian tissue in the wall. The appearance of this tumor could be traced from areas of benign mucinous cystadenoma, through a mucinous tumor of borderline malignancy to a highly malignant anaplastic tumor containing only occasional mucicarmine positive cells. In areas, the connective tissue of the neoplasm, resembled ovarian stroma in appearance. At autopsy, the retroperitoneum was free of neoplasm, but widespread metastases, consisting of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma were observed.

15151,Hemin is kinetically trapped in cytochrome b(5) from rat outer mitochondrial membrane.,"Cytochrome b(5) from the outer mitochondrial membrane of rat liver (OM cyt b(5)) is substantially more stable to thermal and chemical denaturation than cytochrome b(5) from the endoplasmic reticulum of bovine liver (microsomal, or Mc cyt b(5)). In contrast, the corresponding apoproteins have similar stability, suggesting stronger interactions between hemin and the polypeptide in OM cyt b(5). Whereas complete transfer of hemin from bovine Mc cyt b(5) to apomyoglobin at pH 5.2 takes less than 1 h, hemin transfer from OM cyt b(5) is unmeasurably slow. Coupled with the previously reported 1:1 ratio of hemin orientational isomers in OM cyt b(5), this finding suggests that the cofactor is kinetically trapped under physiologically relevant conditions. This conclusion is confirmed by (1)H NMR studies which show that the hemin isomeric ratio changes when the protein is incubated for several hours at 68 degrees C. Interestingly, the orientational isomer favored in OM cyt b(5) is the form less favored in all other known cytochromes b(5).","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cytochromes b5', 'Drug Stability', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Hemin', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Kinetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mitochondria, Liver', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Thermodynamics']",10873629,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D08.244.187.500', 'D12.776.422.220.187.500'], ['E05.916.330'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.248'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.500.640.587.462', 'D03.633.400.909.500.640.587.462', 'D04.345.783.500.640.587.462', 'D23.767.727.640.587.462'], ['E05.481'], ['A11.284.149.450', 'A11.284.835.514'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564.461', 'A11.284.835.626.461'], ['G01.154.651.750.500', 'G02.111.688.750.500'], ['D12.776.800'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.828'], ['G01.906']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27127,Molecular Mapping and Candidate Gene Analysis for GA3,"Plants with shorter internodes are suitable for high-density planting, lodging resistance and the preservation of land resources by improving yield per unit area. In this study, we identified a locus controlling the short internode trait in watermelon using Zhengzhouzigua (long internode) and Duan125 (short internode) as mapping parents. Genetic analysis indicated that F1 plants were consistent with long internode plants, which indicates that the long internode was dominant over the short internode. The observed F2 and BC1 individuals fitted the expected phenotypic segregation ratios of 3:1 and 1:1, respectively. The locus was mapped on chromosome 9 using a bulked segregant analysis approach. The region was narrowed down to 8.525 kb having only one putative gene, Cla015407, flanking by CAPS90 and CAPS91 markers, which encodes gibberellin 3â-hydroxylase (GA 3â-hydroxylase). The sequence alignment of the candidate gene between both parents revealed a 13 bp deletion in the short internode parent, which resulted in a truncated protein. Before GA3 application, significantly lower GA3 content and shorter cell length were obtained in the short internode plants. However, the highest GA3 content and significant increase in cell length were observed in the short internode plants after exogenous GA3 application. In the short internode plants, the expression level of the Cla015407 was threefold lower than the long internode plants in the stem tissue. In general, our results suggested that Cla015407 might be the candidate gene responsible for the short internode phenotype in watermelon and the phenotype is responsive to exogenous GA3 application.","['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Citrullus', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', 'Nematoda', 'Plant Diseases', 'Plant Proteins']",31906246,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.393.183'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.300.140'], ['E05.393.385'], ['G05.348'], ['D08.811.682.690.708'], ['B01.050.500.500.294'], ['G15.610'], ['D12.776.765']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18354,Release of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide after volume expansion is not related to pituitary-adrenal axis diurnal variation in normal subjects.,"The existence of a circadian rhythm of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in humans is controversial. We studied the plasma ANP response to isotonic blood volume expansion in the morning and in the afternoon and its relationship with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-cortisol diurnal variation in seven normal subjects. Basal plasma ANP level was similar in the morning (19.6 +/- 2.4 pg/ml) and in the afternoon (21.8 +/- 4.8 pg/ml). The ANP peak obtained with saline infusion (0.9% NaCl, 12 ml/kg) in the morning (49.4 +/- 8 pg/ml) did not differ from that obtained in the afternoon (60.3 +/- 10.1 pg/ml). There was no correlation between the individual mean cortisol and ACTH levels and the ANP peak obtained with saline infusion. These data indicate no diurnal variation in plasma ANP secretion induced by blood volume expansion and no relationship between plasma ANP peak and ACTH-cortisol diurnal variation.","['Adrenal Glands', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone', 'Adult', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Plasma Substitutes']",9283629,"[['A06.300.071'], ['D06.472.699.327.935.531.500', 'D06.472.699.631.525.600.531.500', 'D12.644.400.400.935.531.500', 'D12.644.548.365.935.531.500', 'D12.644.548.691.525.690.531.500', 'D12.776.631.650.405.935.531.500'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D06.472.699.584.500', 'D12.644.548.585.500'], ['G07.180.562.190'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['A06.300.747', 'A06.688.357.750', 'A08.186.211.180.497.352.435.500', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.352.435.500', 'A08.713.357.750'], ['D27.505.954.502.140.500']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
40695,Increasing longevity by decreasing sympathetic stress--early beta receptor blockade pharmacotherapy.,"Consideration regarding human aging and sympathetic nervous system activity suggests that old age represents a hyperadrenergic state. With advancing age the sympathetically mediated stress on the body, specifically the cardiovascular system, may outweigh the benefits an intact sympathetic nervous system conveys for short-term survival. Beta blockers temper the effects of the sympathetic nervous system by slowing heart rate and decreasing blood pressure. Recently, beta blockers have been shown to improve outcome and survival following surgery and myocardial infarction, have beneficial effects in patients with heart failure, and may have an antiatherosclerotic effect. We propose that instituting beta receptor blockade pharmacotherapy at an early age will increase longevity by countering the adverse effects of sympathetically mediated stress.","['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Aging', 'Autonomic Nervous System Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Humans', 'Longevity', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Sympathetic Nervous System']",15082101,"[['D27.505.519.625.050.200.200', 'D27.505.696.577.050.200.200'], ['G07.345.124'], ['C10.177'], ['C14'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G07.345.124.519', 'G07.540'], ['G07.775'], ['A08.800.050.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Measurements of IgG and IgA in saliva and blood serum were performed in 87 persons during medical check-up before admission to work in a sulphur mine. Persons with cough and/or sputum production usually in the morning or during the day or at night were defined as positive symptoms. From the study, different immunoglobulin patterns have emerged in saliva and serum in relation to smoking. IgG content in saliva of smokers was lower and IgA higher than in non-smokers. Levels of both immunoglobulins in serum were lower among smokers. In persons with respiratory symptoms IgG content in saliva was markedly lower especially in smokers.","['Adult', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases', 'Saliva', 'Smoking']",549178,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
49057,Clubbed fingers in a patient with inflammatory gingival hyperplasia.,"The association of clubbing with miscellaneous diseases and its diagnostic implications are such that its detection should prompt consideration of the underlying etiology. We encountered a 48-year-old woman with clubbed fingers and a cauliflower-like gingival swelling on the hard palate of the upper jaw. There were no conventionally well-known causes for clubbing. Histological examination of gum biopsy specimen revealed a diagnosis of inflammatory gingival hyperplasia. As an etiology of clubbed fingers, gingivitis was suggested, since clubbing was regressed in parallel with remission of the gingivitis after the treatment by extraction of anterior teeth. Possible involvement of an autoimmune process in the pathogenesis was also considered, because of concomitant elevation of serum anti-double strand DNA antibodies. We recommend examination of the oral cavity for search of an inflammatory disease in cases with clubbed fingers, particularly when other common causes are not apparent.","['Antibodies, Antinuclear', 'Biopsy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gingiva', 'Gingival Hyperplasia', 'Gingivitis', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoarthropathy, Secondary Hypertrophic', 'Tooth Extraction']",16415555,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.323.204', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.323.204', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.323.204'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['E01.171'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['A14.549.167.646.480'], ['C07.465.714.258.428.250'], ['C01.408', 'C07.465.714.258.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05.116.758', 'C05.550.684'], ['E04.545.700', 'E06.645.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

39148,Waist circumference and abdominal adipose tissue distribution: influence of age and sex.,"BACKGROUND: The influence of age and sex on the distribution of abdominal adipose tissue for a given waist circumference (WC) is unclear.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the influence of age and sex on total (TAAT), visceral (VAT), and abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT) adipose tissue for a given WC.DESIGN: Body composition was assessed by whole-body magnetic resonance imaging in 147 younger men (< 50 y), 83 older men, 171 younger (premenopausal) women, and 80 older (postmenopausal) women with a wide range (16-40; in kg/m(2)) of body mass indexes.RESULTS: Within each sex, the regression lines between WC and TAAT were not significantly different (P > 0.1) between younger and older groups. Collapsed across age groups, women had more TAAT for a given WC than did men; however, this difference was significantly reduced with increasing WC (P < 0.05). Within each sex, regression lines derived for WC and ASAT were not significantly different between younger and older groups (P > 0.1). Collapsed across age groups, women had 1.8 kg more ASAT for a given WC (P < 0.05) than did men across the range of WCs. Within each sex, older men and women had a significantly greater increase in VAT for a given WC (P < 0.05) than did younger men and women. Furthermore, independent of age group, the slopes for WC and VAT were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in men than in women.CONCLUSIONS: There are significant sex differences in TAAT, VAT, and ASAT for a given WC. Furthermore, the relation between WC and VAT is substantially influenced by age.","['Abdomen', 'Adipose Tissue', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Body Composition', 'Body Constitution', 'Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Factors', 'Viscera', 'Waist-Hip Ratio']",15941883,"[['A01.923.047'], ['A10.165.114'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G07.345.124'], ['G02.111.130', 'G03.180', 'G07.100.049'], ['E01.370.600.115', 'G07.100'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G08.686.815'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['A01.960'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.960', 'E05.041.124.946', 'G07.100.100.960']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
43596,Delay in diagnostic workup and treatment of esophageal cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Esophageal cancer should preferably be detected and treated at an early stage, but this may be prohibited by late onset of symptoms and delays in referral, diagnostic workup, and treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of these delays on outcome in patients with esophageal cancer.METHODS: For 491 patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer between 1991 and 2007, patients' short- and long-term outcome were analyzed according to different time intervals between onset of symptoms, diagnosis, and surgical treatment.RESULTS: Length of prehospital delay (from onset of symptoms until endoscopic diagnosis) did not affect patient's short- or long-term outcome. A shorter hospital delay between establishing the diagnosis of esophageal cancer on endoscopy and surgery was associated with lower overall morbidity and in-hospital mortality. Patients of ASA classes I and II experienced a shorter hospital delay than patients of ASA classes III and IV. Length of hospital delay between endoscopic diagnosis and surgery did not affect pathological tumor-node-metastasis stage or R0-resection rate. Longer hospital delay did not result in worse survival: Overall survival after esophagectomy for cancer was not significantly different between patients with hospital delay <5, 5-8, or >8 weeks (24.7%, 21.7%, and 32.3%, respectively; p = 0.12).CONCLUSION: A longer hospital delay (between endoscopic diagnosis and surgery) resulted in worse patient's short-term outcome (higher overall morbidity and mortality rates) but not in a worse long-term outcome (overall survival). This may be explained by a more time-consuming diagnostic workup in patients with a poorer physical status and not by tumor progression.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Cohort Studies', 'Delayed Diagnosis', 'Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Esophagectomy', 'Esophagoscopy', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Waiting Lists']",20012379,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.119', 'E01.370.225.998.054.119', 'E01.370.388.100.100', 'E04.074.119', 'E04.665.100', 'E05.200.500.384.100.119', 'E05.200.998.054.119', 'E05.242.384.100.119'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E01.110', 'E02.760.273', 'N02.421.585.273'], ['C04.588.274.476.205', 'C04.588.443.353', 'C06.301.371.205', 'C06.405.117.430', 'C06.405.249.205'], ['E04.210.346'], ['E01.370.372.250.250.275', 'E01.370.388.250.250.250.260', 'E04.210.240.250.260', 'E04.502.250.250.250.260'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.400', 'N01.224.935.698.400', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.400', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.998.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.650', 'N06.850.520.830.998.650'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E05.318.740.600', 'G17.680', 'N05.715.360.750.625', 'N06.850.520.830.600'], ['E01.789'], ['N04.452.758.849'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['N04.452.095.738']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
38765,Carbon nanotubes exert basic excitatory enhancement in rat brain slices.,"Carbon nanotubes are promising new tools in biomedicine but they may have yet some unknown influences on the organism. In the present study, the acute effect of solubilized, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on basic neuronal functions was examined. Rat brain slices were treated in vitro with nanotube-containing colloid solutions at concentrations of 100-800 ìg/ml and evoked field potentials were recorded from the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. Basic excitability of the treated slices was characterized by the amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and population spikes. Experimental results indicated significantly higher excitability of treated samples than that of controls. Multiple components in evoked potentials were observed, which is in accordance with the increased excitability of investigated brain areas. Tests of short- and long-term plasticity were also performed, which revealed no difference between control and treated slices. Experimental results suggest an interaction between nanotubes and brain tissue. MWCNTs seem to act on the basic membrane potential of neurons by changing membrane properties or via a mechanism linked to voltage-gated ion channels, rather than influencing specific synaptic transmission.

In a repeated-measures design, the Profile of Mood States inventory (D. M. McNair, M. Lorr, & L. F. Droppleman, 1971) was administered before and after 1 quiet resting trial and 3 exercise trials of 10, 20, and 30 min on a bicycle ergometer.

An overall analysis of variance found improved levels of vigor with reduced levels of confusion, fatigue, and total negative mood. Planned analyses revealed that the improvements in vigor, fatigue, and total mood occurred after 10 min of exercise, with progressive improvements in confusion over 20 min and with no additional improvement over longer periods. These results complement current recommendations, which suggest that to experience positive fitness and health benefits, healthy adults should participate in a total of 30 min of moderate physical exercise daily, accumulated in short bouts throughout the day.","['Adult', 'Affect', 'Exercise', 'Humans', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors']",11515738,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.470.047'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
33743,Resolution of bone marrow fibrosis in a patient receiving JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor treatment with ruxolitinib.,"UNLABELLED: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is currently the only pharmacological agent approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Approval was based on findings from two phase 3 trials comparing ruxolitinib with placebo (COMFORT-I) and with best available therapy (COMFORT-II) for the treatment of primary or secondary myelofibrosis. In those pivotal trials, ruxolitinib rapidly improved splenomegaly, disease-related symptoms, and quality of life and prolonged survival compared with both placebo and conventional treatments. However, for reasons that are currently unclear, there were only modest histomorphological changes in the bone marrow, and only a subset of patients had significant reductions in JAK2 V617F clonal burden. Here we describe a patient with post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis who received ruxolitinib at our institution (Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom) as part of the COMFORT-II study. While on treatment, the patient had dramatic improvements in splenomegaly and symptoms shortly after starting ruxolitinib. With longer treatment, the patient had marked reductions in JAK2 V617F allele burden, and fibrosis of the bone marrow resolved after approximately 3 years of ruxolitinib treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed case report of resolution of fibrosis with a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00934544.","['Aged', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Male', 'Primary Myelofibrosis', 'Pyrazoles', 'Treatment Outcome']",24056820,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.124.100', 'D12.776.476.393.100'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.124.200', 'D12.776.476.393.200', 'D12.776.624.664.700.117'], ['C15.378.190.636.765'], ['D03.383.129.539'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
23236,"Yeast spt6-140 mutation, affecting chromatin and transcription, preferentially increases recombination in which Rad51p-mediated strand exchange is dispensable.","We have shown that the spt6-140 and spt4-3 mutations, affecting chromatin structure and transcription, stimulate recombination between inverted repeats by a RAD52-dependent mechanism that is very efficient in the absence of RAD51, RAD54, RAD55, and RAD57. Such a mechanism of recombination is RAD1-RAD59-dependent and yields gene conversions highly associated with the inversion of the repeat. The spt6-140 mutation alters transcription and chromatin in our inverted repeats, as determined by Northern and micrococcal nuclease sensitivity analyses, respectively. Hyper-recombination levels are diminished in the absence of transcription. We believe that the chromatin alteration, together with transcription impairment caused by spt6-140, increases the incidence of spontaneous recombination regardless of whether or not it is mediated by Rad51p-dependent strand exchange. Our results suggest that spt6, as well as spt4, primarily stimulates a mechanism of break-induced replication. We discuss the possibility that the chromatin alteration caused by spt6-140 facilitates a Rad52p-mediated one-ended strand invasion event, possibly inefficient in wild-type chromatin. Our results are consistent with the idea that the major mechanism leading to inversions might not be crossing over but break-induced replication followed by single-strand annealing.","['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fungal Proteins', 'Genotype', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Hydro-Lyases', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Rad51 Recombinase', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors']",11404325,"[['E05.196.401.095', 'E05.301.300.074', 'E05.601.100'], ['E05.196.401.114', 'E05.301.300.087', 'E05.601.150'], ['A11.284.430.106.279.345.190.160.180', 'D12.776.664.224', 'G05.360.160.180'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D12.776.260'], ['D12.776.354'], ['G05.380'], ['D12.776.580.219'], ['D08.811.520.241.300'], ['E05.599.395.397'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D12.776.660'], ['D08.811.739.650.500', 'D12.776.260.695', 'D12.776.313.968'], ['G05.728'], ['D12.776.354.750'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D12.776.930.955']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Male neonates accounted for 70% of the cases. In 15% of cases, the mothers previously had a known infectious disease and 55% of cases came from an unfavourable socio-economic environment. Over 50% of the infants had to be resuscitated at birth. The majority of organisms isolated were Gram-negative bacteria or Enterobacteriaceae; the commonest organism was Haemophilus influenzae. The most effective specific treatment (91% favourable results) was intravenous amoxycillin plus intramuscular gentamicin. It is recommended that the newborn infant of parents living in unfavourable socio-economic circumstances should receive careful follow-up during the first week after birth so that the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis can be made at the start of infection. The neonate should receive effective prophylactic antibiotic cover if resuscitated, if the mother has suffered from an infectious disease during pregnancy or if premature rupture of the membranes has occurred.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Birth Weight', ""Cote d'Ivoire"", 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Meningitis', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",2834748,"[['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['C23.888.144.186', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.186', 'E05.041.124.160.750.149', 'G07.100.100.160.120.186', 'G07.345.249.314.120.186'], ['Z01.058.290.190.272'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['C10.228.614'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
8243,Results of valvuloplasty in patients presenting deep venous insufficiency and recurring ulceration.,"The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess mid-term results of valvuloplasty in patients presenting chronic recurring venous stasis ulceration. From 1988 to 1993, valvuloplasty was performed in the superficial femoral vein of 33 lower extremities in 28 patients presenting recurring ulceration. In 23 cases, previous surgery in the superficial venous system or perforating vein had failed. Preoperative work-up demonstrated primary deep venous insufficiency (PDVI) in 22 extremities (group I), proximal PDVI in association with distal postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) in 10 (group II), and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome in 1. Hemodynamic assessment with tourniquet placement demonstrated a mean venous return time of 9 sec (+10, -8). Descending femoral phlebography showed Kistner grade 4 in 30 cases. Outcome was evaluated by clinical examination and Dupplex scan with photophlethysmography at follow-up times ranging from 2 to 7.6 years (mean: 51 months). Correlation between outcome of valvuloplasty and clinical findings was excellent. The incidence of poor clinical and hemodynamic results was higher for patients with PTS. Valve repair in association with surgery for superficial vein insufficiency and ligation of perforators gives good results in patients with isolated PDVI.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Femoral Vein', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome', 'Ligation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phlebography', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postphlebitic Syndrome', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Tourniquets', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler, Duplex', 'Varicose Ulcer', 'Venous Insufficiency', 'Venous Thrombosis']",10466996,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['A07.015.908.314'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.077.410'], ['E04.426'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.700.060.600', 'E01.370.370.050.600'], ['E01.370.370.610.600'], ['C23.550.767'], ['C14.907.617.718.760', 'C14.907.952.760'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E07.926'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.350.850.850.850'], ['C14.907.927.730', 'C17.800.893.592.730'], ['C14.907.952'], ['C14.907.355.830.925']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Adherence to weight control, urine/blood testing, medication taking, symptom reporting, and safety demands was assessed using a variety of methods: (a) patients' report in relation to physician's criteria, (b) patients' report in relation to their own understanding of those criteria, (c) significant others' reports, (d) nurses' ratings, and (e) physicians' ratings. Based on attribution theory, it was proposed that informed others would view patients as more consistent than patients themselves did. Separate intercorrelation matrices were created for each method. The correlations, however, were uniformly low (most rs less than .25) and mean correlations did not differ significantly between matrices.

20611,Design of supported membranes tethered via metal-affinity ligand-receptor pairs.,"Model lipid layers are very promising in investigating the complex network of recognition, transport and signaling processes at membranes. We have developed a novel and generic approach to create supported lipid membranes tethered by metal-affinity binding. By self-assembly we have generated various interfaces that display histidine sequences (6xHis) via polymer spacers. These histidine-functionalized interfaces are designed to allow specific docking and fusion of vesicles containing metal-chelating lipids. By means of surface plasmon resonance and atomic force microscopy we analyzed the formation and subsequently the structure of these solid-supported membranes. Although the affinity constant of single ligand-receptor pairs is only in the micromolar range, very stable immobilization of these membranes was observed. This behavior can be explained by multivalent interactions resembling many features of cell adhesion. The process is highly specific, because vesicle docking and bilayer formation are strictly dependent on the presence of metal-affinity ligand-receptor pairs. The surface accessibility and geometry of these tethered membranes were probed by binding of histidine-tagged polypeptides. The supported membranes show adsorption kinetics and values similar to planar supported monolayers. Using various combinations of metal-chelating and histidine-tagged lipids or thiols these metal-affinity-tethered membranes should make a great impact on probing and eventually understanding the dynamic dialog of reconstituted membrane proteins.","['Affinity Labels', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chelating Agents', 'Drug Design', 'Histidine', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Metals', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds']",11106619,"[['D27.720.470.410.080'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D27.505.519.914.500', 'D27.720.832.500'], ['E05.290.500', 'H01.158.703.007.338.500', 'H01.181.466.338.500'], ['D12.125.072.329', 'D12.125.142.308'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['D10.570.510', 'J01.637.087.500.510'], ['D01.552'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.644'], ['D12.776.543.750'], ['D02.886.489']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

2204,"Alleviation of temperature-sensitive secretion defect of Pseudomonas fluorescens ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, TliDEF, by a change of single amino acid in the ABC protein, TliD.","An ABC transporter, TliDEF, from Pseudomonas fluorescens SIK W1, mediates the secretion of its cognate lipase, TliA, in a temperature-dependent secretion manner; the TliDEF-mediated secretion of TliA was impossible at the temperatures over 33°C. To isolate a mutant TliDEF capable of secreting TliA at 35°C, the mutagenesis of ABC protein (TliD) was performed. The mutated tliD library where a random point mutation was introduced by error-prone PCR was coexpressed with the wild-type tliE, tliF and tliA in Escherichia coli. Among approximately 10,000 colonies of the tliD library, we selected one colony that formed transparent halo on LB-tributyrin plates at 35°C. At the growth temperature of 35°C, the selected mutant TliD showed 1.75 U/ml of the extracellular lipase activity, while the wild-type TliDEF did not show any detectable lipase activity in the culture supernatant of E. coli. Moreover, the mutant TliD also showed higher level of TliA secretion than the wild-type TliDEF at other culture temperatures, 20°C, 25°C and 30°C. The mutant TliD had a single amino acid change (Ser287Pro) in the predicted transmembrane region in the membrane domain of TliD, implying that the corresponding region of TliD was important for causing the temperature-dependent secretion of TliDEF. These results suggested that the property of ABC transporter could be changed by the change of amino acid in the ABC protein.","['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Amino Acids', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Culture Media', 'Escherichia coli', 'Lipase', 'Point Mutation', 'Pseudomonas fluorescens', 'Temperature']",27033673,"[['D12.776.157.530.100', 'D12.776.395.550.020', 'D12.776.543.550.192', 'D12.776.543.585.100'], ['D12.125'], ['D12.776.097'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.400'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625.325', 'B03.660.250.580.590.210'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
28369,[Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy. Description of 4 cases].,"The clinical and instrumental characteristics of four patients suffering from idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy are analysed. Patients were diagnosed following hemodynamic and histological tests. The major clinical symptom was cardiac decompensation and/or hyperkinetic or hypokinetic (3rd degree BAV) supraventricular arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation). Electrocardiographic and radiological alterations were not specific. The most typical echocardiographic symptom was the association of: biatrial dilation, dilation and hypertrophy of the right ventricle, normal left ventricular size, normal fractional shortening of the left ventricle. Septal hypertrophy was also observed in one case. Abundant pericardial effusion was present in all cases. When performed, echo-Doppler showed a relatively typical shortened deceleration time through the A-V valve. Catheterism revealed increased ventricular telediastolic pressures and a bi-plateau morphology of the ventricular pressure curve. Heart index was depressed in one patient and the ejection fraction was reduced in one case. Histological tests revealed interstitial fibrosis, cellular hypertrophy and, in one patient, myocardial amyloidosis. One patient underwent a heart transplant, two patients died while waiting for a transplant, one patient is still alive 13 years after the start of 3rd class symptoms.","['Adult', 'Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive', 'Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2092233,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C14.280.238.160'], ['E01.370.350.130.750.220', 'E01.370.350.850.220.220', 'E01.370.350.850.850.220', 'E01.370.370.380.220.220'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E04.100.376.475', 'E04.928.220.390', 'E04.936.450.475'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
37346,Determination of advanced glycation end-products on IgG in liver cirrhosis.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our previous report showed that IgG levels are strongly correlated with the indocyanine green (ICG) retention rate in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). This correlation suggests that hyperglobulinemia in LC could be explained by impairment of hepatic removal function. To estimate IgG turnover in LC, in the present paper was determined the advanced glycation end-products (AGE) on IgG as a marker of half-life.METHODOLOGY: Serum samples were obtained from patients with LC, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sj?gren syndrome (SjS), and from age-matched control patients. IgG was purified from serum by the protein G-based affinity method, concentrated by filtration, and used for assay of Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), a predominant AGE, by ELISA.RESULTS: CML on IgG was significantly lower in patients with LC than in control patients, whereas there was no significant difference in total serum CML levels among patients with LC, RA, and SjS, and control patients. CML levels on IgG were negatively correlated with serum IgG levels in patients with LC, RA, and Sj?gren syndrome SjS.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, it is suggested that IgG turnover is not likely to be prolonged but rather may be shortened in LC It may be concluded that, hyperglobulinemia is primarily caused by enhanced synthesis followed by up-regulation of catabolism of immunoglobulins.","['Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid', 'Female', 'Glycation End Products, Advanced', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic', 'Lysine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",20214227,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C05.550.114.154', 'C05.799.114', 'C17.300.775.099', 'C20.111.199'], ['D12.776.643.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['C06.552.630', 'C23.550.355.412'], ['C17.300.480', 'C20.111.590'], ['D12.125.068.555', 'D12.125.095.647', 'D12.125.142.497'], ['M01.060.116.630']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
22257,Action of tamoxifen on folliculogenesis in the menstrual cycle of infertile patients.,"Daily estimations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone were made in the serum of eight infertile patients from day 1 through the follicular phase during menstrual cycles before and after tamoxifen therapy. Tamoxifen therapy was found to shorten the follicular phase from 15.4 +/- 0.8 days (mean +/- standard error of the mean) to 14.0 +/- 0.6 days (difference not significant) and to lengthen the luteal phase from 12.8 +/- 0.4 days to 14.1 +/- 0.8 days (P less than 0.05). The mean estradiol concentration in the eight patients during tamoxifen treatment cycles rose on day 8 (3 days after starting tamoxifen treatment) and increased significantly (P less than 0.05) from day 10 to midcycle. The integrated follicular phase estradiol concentration in the tamoxifen treatment cycle increased to 2450.1 +/- 208.1 pg/ml/cycle, and was significantly higher (P less than 0.025) than that in the nontreatment cycle. In contrast, the concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin during the follicular phase and at the midcycle peak of tamoxifen treatment cycles were not significantly different from those of the nontreatment cycle. These results suggest that the mechanism of tamoxifen in improving folliculogenesis may involve a direct action on the ovary without intervention of the hypothalamic-pituitary system.","['Adult', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Follicular Phase', 'Gonadotropins, Pituitary', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female', 'Luteal Phase', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Menotropins', 'Progesterone', 'Prolactin', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tamoxifen']",6409673,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['G08.686.605.310'], ['D06.472.699.322.576', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C13.351.500.365.700'], ['G08.686.605.410'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.463', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343.463', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343.463'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.583', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343.583', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343.583', 'D20.215.535'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829', 'D06.472.334.734.623', 'D06.472.334.851.687.750'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.773', 'D06.472.699.631.525.525', 'D12.644.548.691.525.525'], ['G07.690.773.996'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.150.700.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
48583,Recommendations for mass spectrometry data quality metrics for open access data (corollary to the Amsterdam principles).,"Policies supporting the rapid and open sharing of proteomic data are being implemented by the leading journals in the field. The proteomics community is taking steps to ensure that data are made publicly accessible and are of high quality, a challenging task that requires the development and deployment of methods for measuring and documenting data quality metrics. On September 18, 2010, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) convened the ""International Workshop on Proteomic Data Quality Metrics"" in Sydney, Australia, to identify and address issues facing the development and use of such methods for open access proteomics data. The stakeholders at the workshop enumerated the key principles underlying a framework for data quality assessment in mass spectrometry data that will meet the needs of the research community, journals, funding agencies, and data repositories. Attendees discussed and agreed upon two primary needs for the wide use of quality metrics: (i) an evolving list of comprehensive quality metrics and (ii) standards accompanied by software analytics. Attendees stressed the importance of increased education and training programs to promote reliable protocols in proteomics. This workshop report explores the historic precedents, key discussions, and necessary next steps to enhance the quality of open access data. By agreement, this article is published simultaneously in Proteomics, Proteomics Clinical Applications, Journal of Proteome Research, and Molecular and Cellular Proteomics, as a public service to the research community.

1541,Leukotriene C4 receptors in cultured smooth muscle cells from bovine anterior cerebral arteries and microcerebrovasculatures.,"Specific receptors for leukotriene C4 (LTC4) were identified on smooth muscle cells isolated from bovine anterior cerebral arteries (BACASMC) and bovine microcerebrovasculatures (BMSMC). [3H]LTC4 specific bindings to both cells at a fixed input reached the maxima at 60 min and 20 min, respectively. With incremental inputs of radioligand and a constant cell number, [3H]LTC4 specific bindings reached a plateau indicative of a saturable binding site. Analysis of Scatchard plots demonstrated a single population of high-affinity binding sites in both cells. The dissociation constant (Kd) for BACASMC was 39.2 +/- 1.3 nmol.L-1 and its Bmax was 19.3 +/- 2.1 pmol/10(6) cells. For BMSMC, Kd = 2.0 +/- 0.4 nmol.L-1, Bmax = 157 +/- 13 fmol/10(6) cells. The specific [3H]LTC4 bindings was inhibited by unlabeled LTC4, LTD4 and FPL-55712 (an SRS-A antagonist). The inhibitory rates for BACASMC were 70.4% and 35.3% by LTC4 and FPL-55712 at 1 mumol.L-1, respectively. For BMSMC the inhibitory rates were 96.9%, 73.9%, and 44.9% by LTC4, LTD4, and FPL-55712 at 10 mumol.L-1, respectively.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Capillaries', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Arteries', 'Chromones', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Receptors, Leukotriene', 'SRS-A']",1338860,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['A07.015.461.165'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A11.251'], ['A07.015.114.228'], ['D03.383.663.283.266', 'D03.633.100.150.266'], ['G09.330.100.645'], ['A02.633.570.491', 'A07.015.733.500', 'A10.690.467.491'], ['E01.370.225.985', 'E01.370.374.650', 'E01.370.384.720', 'E05.200.985'], ['D12.776.543.750.705'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.200.450'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.450.855', 'D10.251.355.310.166.887.855', 'D23.469.050.175.450.725']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5622,Regulation of Anisotropic Tissue Growth by Two Orthogonal Signaling Centers.,"The Drosophila wing has served as a paradigm to mechanistically characterize the role of morphogens in patterning and growth. Wingless (Wg) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) are expressed in two orthogonal signaling centers, and their gradients organize patterning by regulating the expression of well-defined target genes. By contrast, graded activity of these morphogens is not an absolute requirement for wing growth. Despite their permissive role in regulating growth, here we show that Wg and Dpp are utilized in a non-interchangeable manner by the two existing orthogonal signaling centers to promote preferential growth along the two different axes of the developing wing. Our data indicate that these morphogens promote anisotropic growth by making use of distinct and non-interchangeable molecular mechanisms. Whereas Dpp drives growth along the anterior-posterior axis by maintaining Brinker levels below a growth-repressing threshold, Wg exerts its action along the proximal-distal axis through a double repression mechanism involving T cell factor (TCF).","['Animals', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Morphogenesis', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Wings, Animal', 'Wnt1 Protein']",32084357,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.093.500.462'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.750.310.250.500'], ['G07.345.500'], ['D12.776.260.703', 'D12.776.930.780'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.776.260.730', 'D12.776.660.235.400.800', 'D12.776.664.235.400.800', 'D12.776.930.875'], ['A13.395.823'], ['D12.776.467.984.100', 'D12.776.624.664.700.967', 'D23.529.984.100']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Acute lower-extremity sensory disturbance was the initial symptom in four patients, and one presented with weakness of the hand. Progressive neurological deficit occurred in all patients, but the clinical course and outcome were extremely variable. Myelography revealed an intramedullary lesion in two cases but was completely normal in three; magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic in these patients. Subtotal removal was accomplished in two cases, and myelotomy and biopsy were carried out in three. Four of the cavernous angiomas were located in the cervicothoracic region, whereas one was found in the thoracolumbar cord. All of the patients exhibited characteristic gross and microscopic features as well as hemosiderin-laden macrophages indicating remote hemorrhage.

6843,Plain radiograghs of lumbar spine in patients with low back pain.,"Low back pain (LBP) is a common presenting complaint in our hospital in Enugu Nigeria. Three hundred thirty-three radiographs of patients with LBP were studied. A lot of them had bony outgrowths (osteophytes) on the spine. Plain radiograph of the spine is useful in studying these patients' condition.INTRODUCTION: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the common symptoms which bring patients to hospital and ultimately to radiology department for medical assistance. Plain radiographs of lumbar spine are usually the initial imaging tools requested by clinicians. The objective of this study is to evaluate commonest finding in patients with LBP to guide physicians for improved management.METHODS: This work was a retrospective study. Plain films of these patients with LBP at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, were assessed by two radiologists. Findings documented and analyzed using IBM'S SPSS 22. Association was determined using chi-square with level of significance, p < 0.05.RESULTS: Total number of radiographs reviewed was 333. One hundred and eighty-three (55.0%) patients were females. Age ranged from 14 to 101 years. Mean age of 53.4 ± 15.9 years. Disc space was normal in majority (55.3%, 184/333) of patients; narrowing was observed in most others (43.2%, 144/333), about half of the narrowing occurring along with vacuum phenomenon. Osteophytes were commonest finding in a total of 284/333 (85.3%) existing alone or in combination with other findings. Proportion of patients with osteophytes was highest in sixth to eighth decade of life (98.8% of 61-80 age group), followed by 41-60 age group (92.9%). This association between age group and the presence of osteophytes was statistically significant (p < 0.000). Anterior vertebral body was affected in 85.0% (284/333) of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Osteophytes are common radiologic features in LBP. Anterior vertebral body is most affected. It is commoner in the older age group. Plain radiograph is an invaluable imaging tool in the management of LBP in this part of the world.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Low Back Pain', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Osteophyte', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies']",30293145,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.592.612.107.400'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.058.290.190.565'], ['C05.116.540.310.800'], ['E01.370.350.700'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
32835,Can delirium research activity impact on routine delirium recognition? A prospective cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess if ongoing delirium research activity within an acute admissions unit impacts on prevalent delirium recognition.DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.SETTING: Single-site tertiary university teaching hospital.PARTICIPANTS: 125 patients with delirium, as diagnosed by an expert using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition reference criteria, were recruited to a prospective cohort study investigating use of informant tools to detect unrecognised dementia. This study evaluated recognition of delirium and documentation of delirium by medical staff.INTERVENTIONS: The main study followed an observational design; the intervention discussed was the implementation of this study itself.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was recognition of delirium by the admitting medical team prior to study diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included recording of or description of delirium in discharge summaries, and factors which may be associated with unrecognised delirium.RESULTS: Delirium recognition improved between the first half (48%) and second half (71%) of recruitment (p=0.01). There was no difference in recording of delirium or description of delirium in the text of discharge summaries.CONCLUSION: Delirium research activity can improve recognition of delirium.

31663,In vitro qualitative and quantitative CT assessment of iodinated aerosol nasal deposition using a 3D-printed nasal replica.,"Computed tomography can provide high-resolution details on nasal anatomy being potentially useful for the assessment of nasal spray deposition. The purpose of this technical note was to present a method based on CT imaging to assess qualitatively and quantitatively the in vitro spray deposition patterns within the sinonasal cavities of a nasal replica obtained by three-dimensional (3D) printing, using iodinated contrast agent labelled solutions with high spatial and temporal resolution. Using a third generation dual-source CT scanner in single energy mode, scans of a nasal replica were acquired following application of iodinated contrast agent labelled aerosols with an iodine concentration of 92.5 mgl/mL. Two software programmes were then utilised (Osirix MD v.9.0, Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland; 3mensio, Pie Medical Imaging, Bilthoven, Netherlands) to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of the scans, thus enabling the rapid detection and visualisation of administered single droplets and their voxel-by-voxel localisation. Using this approach, we achieved recovery rates between 84-98% and 89-109% (depending on the software programme) of the total applied aerosol volume.","['Contrast Media', 'Iodine Compounds', 'Models, Anatomic', 'Nasal Sprays', 'Nose', 'Paranasal Sinuses', 'Printing, Three-Dimensional', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",31432300,"[['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['D01.475'], ['J01.897.280.500.545.129', 'L01.178.820.090.545.129'], ['D20.280.055.500', 'D26.255.165.055.291'], ['A01.456.505.733', 'A04.531', 'A09.531'], ['A04.531.621'], ['J01.897.564', 'L01.224.108.150.500', 'L01.296.110.150.500'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

1988,Inhibition in fat-storing cell multiplication by a factor produced by normal cultured murine hepatocytes.,"In this study we demonstrate that hepatocytes isolated from normal mice may efficiently inhibit the multiplication of fat-storing cells (FSC) in culture, either in a coculture system where both cell types are separated by a filter of 0.45 microns pore size or via their conditioned medium. The inhibition may be completely reversed when the hepatocytes are removed and the culture medium is renewed. The inhibitory factor appears as early as 8 h in the medium with an almost maximum effect being reached after 24 h, as long as protein synthesis is allowed. It rapidly loses its efficiency through dilution. The inhibitory capacity of the conditioned medium is maintained after heating at 56 degrees C, dialysis of 100,000 x g centrifugation, but reduced after trypsin treatment. The infection of the hepatocytes by ectromelia virus causes an almost total suppression of the synthesis of the inhibitory factor. This latter result suggests that the multiplication of FSC, which may be inhibited by normal hepatocytes, would no longer be hindered in case of disregulation.","['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium', 'Kupffer Cells', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",2290024,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.085'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.363', 'E05.200.500.363', 'E05.242.363'], ['A11.251'], ['A10.272.491'], ['A11.329.372.588', 'A11.627.482.588', 'A11.733.397.588', 'A15.382.670.522.588', 'A15.382.680.397.588'], ['A03.620'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['D12.776'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

15651,Recurrent germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in high risk families in Israel.,"The spectrum of germline mutations among Jewish non Ashkenazi high risk breast/ovarian cancer families includes a few predominant mutations in BRCA1 (185delAG and Tyr978X) and BRCA2 (8765delAG). A few additional recurring mutations [A1708E, 981delAT, C61G (BRCA1) R2336P, and IVS2 + 1G > A (BRCA2)] have been reported in Jewish non Ashkenazi families. The 4153delA*BRCA1 C61G*BRCA1 and the 4075delGT*BRCA2 has been reported to recur in Russian/Polish non Jews and Ashkenazim, respectively. The rate of these recurring mutations has not been reported in Israeli high risk families. Genotyping for these recurring mutations by restriction enzyme digest and sequencing method was applied to high risk, predominantly cancer affected, unrelated Israeli individuals of Ashkenazi (n = 827), non Ashkenazi (n = 2,777), non Jewish Caucasians (n = 193), and 395 of mixed ethnicity. Jewish participants included 827 Ashkenazi, 804 Balkans, 847 North Africans, 234 Yemenites, and 892 Asians (Iraq and Iran). Age at diagnosis of breast cancer (median ± SD) (n = 2,484) was 47.2 ± 9.6 for all women participants. Males (n = 236) were also included, of whom 24 had breast cancer and 35 had pancreatic cancer. Overall, 8/282 (2.8%) of the Balkan cases carried the BRCA1*A1708E mutation, 4/180 (2.2%) the R2336P mutation, and 0/270 the IVS2 + 1G > A BRCA2 mutations, respectively. Of North Africans, 7/264 (2.65%) carried the BRCA1*981delAT mutation. The BRCA1*C61G mutation was detected in 3/269 Ashkenazi, non Ashkenazi, and non Jewish Russians; the BRCA1*Tyr978X mutation was detected in 23/3220 individuals of non Ashkenazi origin, exclusively of Asian ethnicity (23/892, 2.6% of the Asians tested). The BRCA1*4153delA mutation was noted in 2/285 non Jewish Caucasians, and none of the Ashkenazim (n = 500) carried the BRCA2*4075delGT mutation. Jewish high risk families of North African, Asian, and Balkan descent should be screened for the 981delAT, Tyr978X, A1708E BRCA1, and the R2336P BRCA2 mutations, respectively.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ethnic Groups', 'Female', 'Genes, BRCA1', 'Genes, BRCA2', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Jews', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms']",22399190,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.686.754', 'N01.224.317'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.249.100', 'G05.360.340.024.340.415.400.100'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.249.105', 'G05.360.340.024.340.415.400.105'], ['G05.365.590.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.500.375'], ['M01.686.754.600'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
8071,Beehive-Inspired Macroporous SERS Probe for Cancer Detection through Capturing and Analyzing Exosomes in Plasma.,"The protein phosphorylation status of exosomes can regulate the activity and function of proteins related to cancer development, and it is highly possible to diagnose cancers through analyzing the protein phosphorylation status. However, monitoring the protein phosphorylation status with a simple and label-free method is still clinically challenging. Here, inspired by beehives, we developed an Au-coated TiO2 macroporous inverse opal (MIO) structure with an engineered ""slow light effect"" and thus with outstanding surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance. The MIO structure can capture and analyze the exosomes from plasma of cancer patients without any labeling processes. It was found that the SERS intensity of exosomes at 1087 cm-1 arising from the P-O bond within the phosphoproteins can be used as a criterion for tumor liquid biopsies. The intensity of the 1087 cm-1 SERS peak from exosomes extracted from the plasma of cancer patients (prostate, lung, liver, and colon) is at least two times of that from healthy people. This indicates the simplicity and versatility of this method in cancer diagnostics. Our method has obvious advantages (noninvasive and time-saving) over currently clinically used tumor liquid biopsy techniques (such as western blot), which has great potentials to make vitro cancer diagnostics/monitoring as simple as diagnostics/monitoring of common diseases.","['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Exosomes', 'Humans', 'Liquid Biopsy', 'Nanoparticles', 'Neoplasms', 'Porosity', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman', 'Titanium']",31894690,"[['D23.101.140'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['A11.284.295.588.750', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.880.495'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.396', 'E01.370.225.998.054.396', 'E05.200.500.384.100.396', 'E05.200.998.054.396', 'E05.242.384.100.396'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['C04'], ['G01.374.710'], ['E05.196.822.860', 'E05.196.867.890'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
27684,Drug abuse in Poland.,"The abuse of drugs in Poland, a lesser problem than that of alcoholism, has only recently become a subject of interest. Although at present it is not of crucial importance in the pathology of social life, it may still have serious effects on the individual and society.

42520,"Effect of celiac ganglionectomy on tachykinin innervation, receptor distribution and intestinal responses in the rat.","Substance P (SP) is an important neurotransmitter in the control of intestinal motility and is found in both the enteric and sympathetic nervous systems. This study examined the effect of celiac ganglionectomy on (1) mechanical properties of the circular muscles of the duodenum, ileum and proximal colon, (2) circular muscle responses to SP and neurokinin A. (3) distribution of substance P-like immunoreactive nerves, and (4) the distribution of neurokinin 1 and neurokinin 2 receptors. Celiac ganglionectomy resulted in an effective sympathectomy as evidenced by a marked decrease in norepinephrine content and tyrosine hydroxylase staining in the duodenum, ileum and proximal colon. The in vitro length/tension characteristics of the circular muscle of the duodenum, ileum and colon were unchanged after ganglionectomy. In all regions of the gut studied, substance P and neurokinin A caused dose-dependent contractions that were unaltered by celiac ganglionectomy. Immunohistochemistry revealed moderate substance P-like immunoreactive fibers in the myenteric plexus, submucosal plexus and circular muscle of the ileum, while in the colon, substance P-like immunoreactivity was intense in the myenteric plexus, and moderate in the circular muscle. In vitro autoradiography showed minimal binding of SP (NK1 receptor) or neurokinin A (NK2 receptor) in the ileum and significantly greater binding in the circular muscle layer of the colon. Celiac ganglionectomy did not affect substance P-like immunoreactivity, or NK1 or NK2 receptor binding. A greater contractile response to neurokinins was seen in the colon than in the duodenum or ileum, which paralleled the receptor density. The studies demonstrate that surgical celiac ganglionectomy, unlike chemical sympathectomy, does not affect the substance P innervation, receptor density or physiological responses of the intestine. The greater contractile response of the colon than the ileum parallels the greater receptor density rather than the peptide content as determined by immunhistochemistry.","['Animals', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic', 'Ganglionectomy', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestines', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Smooth', 'Neurokinin A', 'Norepinephrine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Tachykinin', 'Substance P', 'Tachykinins']",8988488,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.340.315.350', 'A08.800.050.300.300', 'A08.800.050.800.300'], ['E04.525.210.105.800.380'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E05.481'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['A03.556.124'], ['G11.427.494'], ['A02.633.570', 'A10.690.467'], ['D12.644.276.812.900.500', 'D12.644.400.800.500', 'D12.644.456.800.500', 'D12.776.467.812.900.500', 'D12.776.631.650.800.500', 'D23.469.050.375.850.550', 'D23.529.812.900.500'], ['D02.033.100.291.502', 'D02.092.063.480', 'D02.092.211.215.746', 'D02.092.311.830', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.830'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.862', 'D12.776.543.750.720.600.830', 'D12.776.543.750.750.555.830'], ['D12.644.276.812.900.866', 'D12.644.400.800.750', 'D12.644.456.800.866', 'D12.776.467.812.900.866', 'D12.776.631.650.800.750', 'D23.469.050.375.850.890', 'D23.529.812.900.866'], ['D12.644.276.812.900', 'D12.644.400.800', 'D12.644.456.800', 'D12.776.467.812.900', 'D12.776.631.650.800', 'D23.469.050.375.850', 'D23.529.812.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
28572,Relationship of the Duration of Ventilator Support to Successful Weaning and Other Clinical Outcomes in 437 Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between durations of ventilator support and weaning outcomes of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) patients.METHODS: Cohort study of 957 PMV patients sequentially admitted to a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH). The study population was 437 PMV patients who underwent weaning, having achieved ?4 hours of sustained spontaneous breathing. They were divided into tertiles of mechanical ventilation (MV) durations and compared for differences (tertile A: 21-58 days, n = 146; tertile B: 59-103 days, n = 147; and tertile C: ?104 days, n = 144).RESULTS: Tertiles showed comparable weaning success rates and survival. As MV durations increased, LTACH postweaning days became progressively greater, whereas decannulations and discharge physical function diminished, and home discharges decreased while nursing facility discharges increased (all P < .001). Patients with lower physical function before critical illness or greater burdens of comorbidities were least likely to be weaned (all P < .001). Younger ages, lower comorbidity burdens, neurological diagnoses, higher admission prealbumin levels, and successful weaning, each independently reduced the risk of death (all P < .01).CONCLUSION: Durations of MV did not affect weaning success or survival, although deleterious effects were found in discharges, decannulations, LTACH postweaning days, and discharge physical function. Durations of MV alone should not guide transfer decisions for subsequent continuing care.","['Aged', 'Critical Illness', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'New York City', 'Patient Discharge', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Insufficiency', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ventilator Weaning']",26792815,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C23.550.291.625'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.107.567.875.350.530.530', 'Z01.107.567.875.500.530.530', 'Z01.433.741'], ['E02.760.169.125', 'E02.760.400.610', 'N02.421.585.169.125', 'N02.421.585.400.610', 'N04.590.233.727.210.125'], ['E02.041.625', 'E02.365.647.729', 'E02.880.820'], ['C08.618.846'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E02.041.625.950', 'E02.880.820.950']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
26144,Bradykinin stimulates phosphoinositide turnover and phospholipase C but not phospholipase D and NADPH oxidase in human neutrophils.,"In response to formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), human neutrophils (PMN) generate superoxide anion (O2-) by the enzyme complex NADPH oxidase. The modulation of phosphoinositide (PPI) turnover and the activation of phospholipases C (PLC) and D (PLD) have been shown to be early steps in the oxidative response of fMLP-stimulated PMN. Although the physiological nonapeptide bradykinin (BK) is involved in inflammation, its participation in PMN activation has not been properly studied. In this work, activation of signal transduction pathways that mediate the oxidative response, and the modulation of the NADPH oxidase activity by BK, are analyzed. A direct comparison between the signal transduction pathway induced by BK and fMLP is also made. BK was not able to elicit O2- production by PMN. Nevertheless, several signal transduction pathways associated with PMN activation were triggered by BK. The nonapeptide induced the phosphorylation of prelabeled membrane PPI. This phenomenon was imitated by PMA and inhibited by H7 and staurosporine, thus suggesting the participation of protein kinase c (PKC). A loss of labeled [32P]PPI was triggered by fMLP. The fact that both PMA and fMLP stimulated O2- production but modulated PPI turnover in different ways, indicates that PPI labeling does not correlate with the oxidative response. Because PKC activation seemed to be a prerequisite for BK-induced modulation of PPI turnover, PLC activation could act as an intermediate step in this mechanism. Our results show that BK activated a PIP2-PLC measured as the release of [3H]IP3. On the contrary, a PC-PLD was highly stimulated by fMLP but not by BK. The fact that BK induced PLC activity but neither that of PLD nor NADPH oxidase, whereas fMLP triggered the activation of both phospholipases and evoked the PMN respiratory burst, suggests that diacylglycerol (DAG) from PIP2 as well as PA or PA-derived DAG, synergize to trigger the PMN oxidative response. Finally, BK inhibited O2- production by fMLP-activated PMN in a time-dependent manner. Since BK did not induce NO production by PMN, the inhibitory effect on the oxidative function was not due to ONOO- formation. These data show that BK plays an important role in inflammation by modulating the PMN function.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bradykinin', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases', 'NADPH Oxidases', 'Neutrophils', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phospholipase D', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Superoxides', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Type C Phospholipases']",8613709,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D12.644.276.812.169', 'D12.644.400.090', 'D12.644.456.193', 'D12.776.467.812.169', 'D12.776.631.650.090', 'D23.469.050.375.110', 'D23.529.812.169'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D02.886.030.676.450.440', 'D12.125.072.050.685.445', 'D12.125.142.666.500', 'D12.125.166.676.450.440', 'D12.644.456.400', 'D23.125.685'], ['D08.811.682.608'], ['D08.811.682.608.575', 'D12.776.331.894', 'D12.776.543.653'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D10.570.755.375.760.400.942'], ['D08.811.277.352.640.700.710'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['G07.690.773.996'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.850', 'D01.339.431.374.850', 'D01.650.550.750.800', 'D02.389.338.732'], ['D02.455.849.291.500.510.850'], ['D08.811.277.352.640.700.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
35169,A method to assess concomitant cardiac phosphodiesterase inhibition and positive inotropy.,"The ability of positive inotropic drugs to inhibit phosphodiesterase was assessed by observance of the potentiation of inotropic responses to the low intrinsic efficacy beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist prenalterol. Previous studies have shown that an increase in tissue stimulus response capability, as is produced for beta-adrenoceptors by blockade of phosphodiesterase, produces an increase in the maximal response to beta-adrenoceptor partial agonists. Using this principle, we tested cardiotonic drugs on normal and prenalterol-pretreated guinea pig left atria and compared the resulting inotropic responses statistically. Prenalterol pretreatment did not potentiate inotropic responses to methoxamine and CaCl2 and blocked (in accordance with beta-adrenoceptor occupation by a low-efficacy partial agonist) responses to norepinephrine (NE), tyramine, and to a certain extent ouabain. This latter finding was attributed to a low-level catecholamine-release by ouabain in this tissue. The inotropic responses to the phosphodiesterase inhibitors isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), theophylline, and enprophylline were greatly potentiated. Similarly, the responses to the cardiotonic drugs (known also to be inhibitors of phosphodiesterase) milrinone, amrinone, and fenoximone were potentiated. Positive inotropy to the cardiotonic drug sulmazole was not significantly potentiated by this procedure, indicating that in this tissue sulmazole may produce inotropic responses by other mechanisms as well. In general, this simple assay may be useful to detect blockade of cardiac phosphodiesterase concomitant with positive inotropy. Although a causal relationship between the PDE inhibition and positive inotropy may not be made from these data, knowledge of PDE blockade may still be useful in the assessment of inotropic mechanism and propensity for toxic side effects.","['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine', 'Adenosine Monophosphate', 'Animals', 'Cardiotonic Agents', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Heart', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors', 'Prenalterol', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta']",2450236,"[['D03.633.100.759.758.824.751.500'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.180', 'D13.695.667.138.180', 'D13.695.827.068.180'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.411.222', 'D27.720.799.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['A07.541'], ['E05.481'], ['E05.599.395'], ['D27.505.519.389.735'], ['D02.033.100.624.698.708', 'D02.033.755.624.698.708', 'D02.092.063.624.698.708'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.300.300.340', 'D12.776.543.750.695.150.300.340', 'D12.776.543.750.720.330.300.340']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
44516,Scoring of radiation-induced micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked human lymphocytes by automated image analysis.,"The micronucleus assay in human lymphocytes is, at present, frequently used to assess chromosomal damage caused by ionizing radiation or mutagens. Manual scoring of micronuclei (MN) by trained personnel is very time-consuming, tiring work, and the results depend on subjective interpretation of scoring criteria. More objective scoring can be accomplished only if the test can be automated. Furthermore, an automated system allows scoring of large numbers of cells, thereby increasing the statistical significance of the results. This is of special importance for screening programs for low doses of chromosome-damaging agents. In this paper, the first results of our effort to automate the micronucleus assay with an image-analysis system are represented. The method we used is described in detail, and the results are compared to those of other groups. Our system is able to detect 88% of the binucleated lymphocytes on the slides. The procedure consists of a fully automated localization of binucleated cells and counting of the MN within these cells, followed by a simple and fast manual operation in which the false positives are removed. Preliminary measurements for blood samples irradiated with a dose of 1 Gy X-rays indicate that the automated system can find 89% +/- 12% of the micronuclei within the binucleated cells compared to a manual screening.","['Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Cell Division', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocytes', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Software Design']",7835161,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['J01.897.104'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['E05.799.513.500', 'G01.750.740.500', 'G04.712.500', 'G07.225', 'G07.738.500', 'N06.850.810.250.180'], ['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E05.481'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['A11.284.430.106.570', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.117.570', 'C23.550.210.570', 'G05.365.590.175.570'], ['E05.393.560.598'], ['L01.224.900.820']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
37207,Recurrence rates after treatment of breast cancer with standard radiotherapy with or without additional radiation.,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy prevents local recurrence of breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery. We evaluated the effect of a supplementary dose of radiation to the tumor bed on the rates of local recurrence among patients who received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for early breast cancer.METHODS: After lumpectomy and axillary dissection, patients with stage I or II breast cancer received 50 Gy of radiation to the whole breast in 2-Gy fractions over a five-week period. Patients with a microscopically complete excision were randomly assigned to receive either no further local treatment (2657 patients) or an additional localized dose of 16 Gy, usually given in eight fractions by means of an external electron beam (2661 patients).RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 5.1 years, local recurrences were observed in 182 of the 2657 patients in the standard-treatment group and 109 of the 2661 patients in the additional-radiation group. The five-year actuarial rates of local recurrence were 7.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.8 to 7.6 percent) and 4.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.8 to 4.7 percent), respectively (P<0.001), yielding a hazard ratio for local recurrence of 0.59 (99 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.81) associated with an additional dose. Patients 40 years old or younger benefited most; at five years, their rate of local recurrence was 19.5 percent with standard treatment and 10.2 percent with additional radiation (hazard ratio, 0.46 [99 percent confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.89]; P=0.002). At five years in the age group 41 to 50 years old, no differences were found in rates of metastasis or overall survival (which were 87 and 91 percent, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early breast cancer who undergo breast-conserving surgery and receive 50 Gy of radiation to the whole breast, an additional dose of 16 Gy of radiation to the tumor bed reduces the risk of local recurrence, especially in patients younger than 50 years of age.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Mastectomy, Segmental', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis']",11794170,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['E02.186'], ['E05.799.513.500', 'G01.750.740.500', 'G04.712.500', 'G07.225', 'G07.738.500', 'N06.850.810.250.180'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['E04.466.701'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789.625'], ['N04.761.700', 'N05.700'], ['E02.895'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
48043,Comparison of effects of neuropeptide Y and norepinephrine on insulin secretion and vascular resistance in perfused rat pancreas.,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and norepinephrine (NE) behave like cotransmitters in intrapancreatic adrenergic nerves. Therefore, in the isolated rat pancreas, we 1) studied and compared the effect of increasing concentrations of NE and NPY given alone on insulin secretion induced by 8.3 mM glucose and on pancreatic vascular flow rate and 2) investigated the effects of combinations of NPY and NE at low concentrations. NE induced a dose-dependent inhibition of insulin release between 1 and 50 nM (max 80%); beta-cells appeared sensitive to NPY at 0.1 nM, but the maximal reduction of insulin release was comparatively weak (25-30%) at 10 nM. The study of the effect of combinations of NE and NPY at different concentrations suggests that the two neurotransmitters act in an additive way to inhibit insulin secretion. NPY (0.1-10 nM) induced a marked dose-dependent reduction of pancreatic outflow rate with a biphasic pattern between 1 and 10 nM. On the other hand, at low concentrations (1 and 2 nM), NE induced a progressive increase in pancreatic outflow rate; a clear but transient decrease could only be observed at 50 nM before a secondary increase. A combined treatment with two effective concentrations of NPY (0.1 nM) and NE (1 nM) resulted in a progressive reversal by NE of NPY's vasoconstrictive effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Secretion', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Neuropeptide Y', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pancreas', 'Perfusion', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Time Factors', 'Vascular Resistance']",2040381,"[['B01.050'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.481'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['G03.442', 'G07.475'], ['A03.734.414', 'A06.300.414'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D12.644.400.500', 'D12.776.631.650.500'], ['D02.033.100.291.502', 'D02.092.063.480', 'D02.092.211.215.746', 'D02.092.311.830', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.830'], ['A03.734'], ['E05.680'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['G01.910.857'], ['G09.330.380.921']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
46095,[New approach for unresectable primary liver cancer--intra-arterial combination chemotherapy during and after operation with local injection of ethanol].,"From 1976 to 1988, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy was performed in 52 patients with unresectable hepato-cellular carcinomas. Forty-nine (94%) out of 52 patients were stage III or stage IV. Thirty-five patients underwent continuous infusion of 5-FU and MMC employing chronometric infusion pumps. Mean survival of this group was 9 months. Six patients survived more than 12 months; the longest survivor died of different causes 40 months after surgery. Another patient lived for 30 months. In 10 patients, hepatic arterial ligation was performed in combination with infusion chemotherapy in the hepatic artery. Mean survival of these patients was 14 months. Four out of the 10 patients survived over 12 months. Recently, in 7 patients whose liver tumors were less than 4 cm in diameter and/or whose tumors were multiple and had liver disfunction, ethanol injection into the tumors during laparotomy was performed in combination with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy. In these 7 patients, an injection port system was implanted subcutaneously for intermittent infusion chemotherapy of MMC + 5-FU and ADM + lipiodol. Mean survival in this group was 14 months. One of 7 patients died 21 months after operation, but the others are alive at this writing. Five of these 6 patients have survived more than 12 months. AFP levels decreased in 3 patients after these treatments. In one case, AFP decreased to normal range for 18 months. These results suggested that intraoperative ethanol injection therapy into the tumors combining with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy may be of value for unresectable smaller liver carcinomas, since this method is technically easy and can assure injection of ethanol into the tumors during laparotomy.","['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Doxorubicin', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil', 'Hepatic Artery', 'Humans', 'Infusion Pumps', 'Infusions, Intra-Arterial', 'Injections', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins', 'Postoperative Care']",2551220,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.255', 'C04.588.274.623.160', 'C06.301.623.160', 'C06.552.697.160'], ['E02.186'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['D02.033.375'], ['D03.383.742.698.875.404'], ['A07.015.114.407'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E07.505', 'E07.858.082.505'], ['E02.319.267.510.520'], ['E02.319.267.530'], ['E02.760.731.400', 'E04.604.249', 'N02.421.585.722.400'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.806.400.249.350', 'D03.383.097.500.350', 'D03.633.100.473.412.249.350'], ['D02.806.400.249', 'D03.383.097.500', 'D03.633.100.473.412.249'], ['E02.760.731.700', 'E04.604.500', 'N02.421.585.722.700']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
8325,Molecular genetics of anti-carbohydrate antibodies.,"Antibodies directed against carbohydrate determinants provide useful model systems for understanding the structure and organisation of antibody genes and the generation of antibody diversity. We have used three such systems, PC, DEX and GAC, and have studied the heavy chains and VH gene segments of each. In two of these systems, PC and GAC, much of the diversity in heavy-chain protein sequences results from somatic mutation events superimposed on expression of a single VH gene. In the DEX system, it appears that germ-line sequence diversity may be an important contributor to the variability in heavy-chain sequence. Detailed structural analyses of this type will ultimately provide a complete picture of the mechanisms which underlie effective humoral immunity.","['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Diversity', 'Antibody Formation', 'Carbohydrates', 'DNA', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI', 'Dextrans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phosphorylcholine', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial']",6201131,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114'], ['G05.365.036', 'G12.500.199'], ['G12.450.050.370.250'], ['D09'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D08.811.150.280', 'D08.811.277.352.335.350.300', 'D08.811.277.352.355.325.300'], ['D08.811.150.280.260.300', 'D08.811.277.352.335.350.300.260.250', 'D08.811.277.352.355.325.300.260.250'], ['D05.750.078.562.272', 'D09.698.365.272'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['D02.092.877.883.333.700', 'D02.675.276.232.700'], ['D09.698.718', 'D23.050.161.616']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
11590,"Oral fibrinogen-depleting agent lumbrokinase for secondary ischemic stroke prevention: results from a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group and controlled clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: Elevated fibrinogen (Fg) level is a known risk factor for ischemic stroke. There are few clinical trials on oral fibrinogen-depleting therapies for secondary ischemic stroke prevention. We aimed to assess the effects of one-year therapy with oral lumbrokinase enteric-coated capsules on secondary ischemic stroke prevention.METHODS: This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group and controlled study that began treatment in hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke and continued for 12 months. Patients were randomized to either the control group that received the standard stroke treatment or the fibrinogen-depleting group that received the standard stroke treatment plus enteric-coated lumbrokinase capsules. The NIH Stroke Scale scores (NIHSSs) and plasma Fg level were recorded. The carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and status of plaques were examined through carotid ultrasound examination. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, any event of recurrent ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction and angina, and other noncerebral ischemia or hemorrhage. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Long-rank test were used to compare total vascular end point incidence between the two groups. Comparison of median values between two groups was done by the Student t test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or non-parametric rank sum test.RESULTS: A total of 310 patients were enrolled, 192 patients in the treatment group and 118 patients in the control group. Compared to the control group, the treatment group showed favorable outcomes in the Fg level, carotid IMT, the detection rate of vulnerable plaques, the volume of carotid plaques, NIHSS scores, and incidence of total vascular (6.78% and 2.08%, respectively) and cerebral vascular events (5.93% and 1.04%, respectively) (P < 0.05). In the treatment group, the volume of carotid plaques was significantly related to the carotid IMT, the plaque diameter, width and number (P = 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.022; F = 13.51, 2.52, 11.33, -3.29, but there was a weak correlation with the Fg level (P = 0.056). After 1-year therapy, the incidence of overall vascular end points was reduced by 4.7%.CONCLUSION: Long-term oral fibrinogen-depleting therapy may be beneficial for secondary ischemic stroke prevention.","['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Carotid Intima-Media Thickness', 'Endopeptidases', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Stroke']",24229674,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.350.850.150', 'E01.370.370.180', 'G09.330.210'], ['D08.811.277.656.300'], ['D12.776.124.050.250', 'D12.776.124.125.500', 'D12.776.811.300', 'D23.119.490'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.897', 'N02.421.726.825', 'N06.850.780.750'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

1324,Low dynamic state of viral competition in a chronic avian hepadnavirus infection.,"The dynamic state of infection of 11 ducks with the duck hepatitis B virus was investigated. Chronic infections were established in newly hatched ducklings by inoculation with a mixture of wild-type virus and a mutant virus with a partial replication defect. As expected, the wild-type virus was rapidly enriched in the virus population during the spread of infection. Enrichment thereafter was correlated with normal growth of the liver, with the average mutant-to-wild-type ratio stabilizing for at least 2 months beyond the time at which the liver mass stabilized. Using experimentally determined growth rates for the mutant and wild-type viruses, we estimated that after the spread of infection, competition between the two virus strains was limited by the amount of replication required to infect new hepatocytes in the growing livers. The results suggest that, in a chronically infected liver, the selection of variants with a replication rate advantage is inefficient and that the emergence of such variants would depend on induced liver cell turnover, such as that occurring during chronic hepatitis.","['Animals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Ducks', 'Hepadnaviridae Infections', 'Hepatitis B Virus, Duck', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Mutagenesis', 'Virus Replication']",10799602,"[['B01.050'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.050.200', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.345'], ['C01.925.256.430'], ['B04.280.375.100.450', 'B04.450.390.100.450'], ['L01.224.680'], ['G05.558'], ['G06.920.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
12182,VLA-2 (alpha2beta1) integrin promotes rotavirus entry into cells but is not necessary for rotavirus attachment.,"In an attempt to identify the rotavirus receptor, we tested 46 cell lines of different species and tissue origins for susceptibility to infection by three N-acetyl-neuraminic (sialic) acid (SA)-dependent and five SA-independent rotavirus strains. Susceptibility to SA-dependent or SA-independent rotavirus infection varied depending on the cell line tested and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) used. Cells of renal or intestinal origin and transformed cell lines derived from breast, stomach, bone, or lung were all susceptible to rotavirus infection, indicating a wider host tissue range than previously appreciated. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), baby hamster kidney (BHK-21), guinea pig colon (GPC-16), rat small intestine (Rie1), and mouse duodenum (MODE-K) cells were found to support only limited rotavirus replication even at MOIs of 100 or 500, but delivery of rotavirus particles into the cytoplasm by lipofection resulted in efficient rotavirus replication. The rotavirus cell attachment protein, the outer capsid spike protein VP4, contains the sequence GDE(A) recognized by the VLA-2 (alpha2beta1) integrin, and to test if VLA-2 is involved in rotavirus attachment and entry, we measured infection in CHO cells that lack VLA-2 and CHO cells transfected with the human alpha2 subunit (CHOalpha2) or with both the human alpha2 and beta1 subunits (CHOalpha2beta1) of VLA-2. Infection by SA-dependent or SA-independent rotavirus strains was 2- to 10-fold more productive in VLA-2-expressing CHO cells than in parental CHO cells, and the increased susceptibility to infection was blocked with anti-VLA-2 antibody. However, the levels of binding of rotavirus to CHO, CHOalpha2, and CHOalpha2beta1 cells were equivalent and were not increased over binding to susceptible monkey kidney (MA104) cells or human colonic adenocarcinoma (Caco-2, HT-29, and T-84) cells, and binding was not blocked by antibody to the human alpha2 subunit. Although the VLA-2 integrin promotes rotavirus infection in CHO cells, it is clear that the VLA-2 integrin alone is not responsible for rotavirus cell attachment and entry. Therefore, VLA-2 is not involved in the initial attachment of rotavirus to cells but may play a role at a postattachment level.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD', 'CHO Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha2', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrin beta1', 'Integrins', 'Mice', 'Neuraminidase', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Collagen', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing', 'Rotavirus', 'Sialic Acids', 'Transfection']",11773387,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['D23.050.301.264.035', 'D23.101.100.110'], ['A11.251.210.200', 'A11.436.155'], ['A11.251'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.408.100.350'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.625.347', 'D12.776.543.550.200.625.347', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.530.500', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.850.299', 'D12.776.543.750.705.877.347', 'D23.050.301.350.625.347'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.408.200.500'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.408'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D08.811.277.450.692'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.685'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.625', 'D12.776.543.550.200.625', 'D12.776.543.750.705.877', 'D23.050.301.350.625'], ['B04.820.223.719.790'], ['D02.241.081.844.562.668', 'D02.241.511.902.562.668', 'D09.067.687.668', 'D09.811.589.668'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27048,Convergent validity of the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ): meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to use a meta-analytic approach to examine the convergent validity of the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ).DESIGN: Systematic review by meta-analysis.SETTING: The relevant studies were surveyed from five electronic databases. Primary outcomes of interest were the product-moment correlation coefficients between IPAQ and other instruments. Five separate meta-analyses were performed for each physical activity (PA) category of IPAQ: walking, moderate PA (MPA), total moderate PA (TMPA), vigorous PA (VPA) and total PA (TPA). The corrected mean effect size (ESñ) unaffected by statistical artefacts (i.e., sampling error and reliability) was calculated for each PA category. Selected moderator variables were length of IPAQ (i.e., short and long form), reference period (i.e., last 7 d and usual week), mode of administration (i.e., interviewer and self-reported), language (i.e., English and translated) and instruments (i.e., accelerometer, pedometer and subjective measure).SUBJECTS: A total of 152 ESñ across five PA categories were retrieved from twenty-one studies.RESULTS: The results showed small- to medium-sized ESñ (0.27-0.49). The highest value was observed in VPA while the lowest value was found in MPA. The ESñ were differentiated by some of the moderator variables across PA categories.CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the overall convergent validity of IPAQ within each PA category. Some differences in degree of convergent validity across PA categories and moderator variables imply that different research conditions should be taken into account prior to deciding on use of the appropriate type of IPAQ.","['Exercise', 'Humans', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",22874087,"[['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

All participants were asked to chew each mouth-full of food 6-7 times and to be very careful not to swallow any of the food. Electrogastrograms (EGGs) were recorded for 10 min prior to, during, and for 15 min after sham feeding. A questionnaire was given to each participant after the procedure as a manipulation check and to assess food palatability. Results from the questionnaire showed, as expected, that the cooked frankfurters were significantly more appetizing than the cold tofu frankfurters (P < 0.01). In the group sham fed appetizing food, 3 cycles per minute (cpm) power increased during sham feeding, but the change was not significant; however, 3 cpm power decreased in the group sham fed unappetizing food. This difference was significant (P < 0.05). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the cephalic-vagal reflex, as measured by power in the 3 cpm frequency region of the EGG, is sensitive to the subjective palatability of the food.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Appetite', 'Electrophysiology', 'Female', 'Food Preferences', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Reflex', 'Stomach', 'Taste', 'Vagus Nerve']",11298993,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F02.830.071', 'G07.203.650.390.070', 'G10.261.390.070'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['F01.145.407.516', 'G07.203.650.353.516'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.376.550.650', 'E01.370.600.550.650', 'F02.830.702', 'G11.561.731'], ['A03.556.875.875'], ['F02.830.816.724', 'G11.561.790.724'], ['A08.800.050.050.925', 'A08.800.050.600.825', 'A08.800.800.060.920', 'A08.800.800.120.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
37259,Glial aromatization decreases neural injury in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata): influence on apoptosis.,"Emerging evidence suggests a neuroprotective role for oestrogens following damage to the vertebrate brain. Aromatase (oestrogen synthase) is rapidly transcribed and translated in glial cells around areas of neural damage in several vertebrates. However, the potential neuroprotection afforded by locally up-regulated glial aromatase immediately surrounding the injury remains to be tested. Towards this end, individual birds sustained penetrating mechanical injuries via a needle that contained either vehicle or the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole into contralateral hemispheres. Seventy-two hours later, the size of neural injury (as assessed by the extent of necrotic tissue) and the number of apoptotic cells around the injuries were evaluated. The size of injury in the hemisphere injected with fadrozole was significantly larger than the injury caused by vehicle injection. Furthermore, a greater number of apoptotic nuclei were found around the fadrozole-associated lesion relative to vehicle. Finally, constitutively expressed, neuronal aromatase close to the injury site did not differ between hemispheres. We conclude that local inhibition of glial aromatase immediately around the site of injury plays a neuroprotective role in the songbird brain and this protection involves apoptotic pathways. Local up-regulation of glial aromatase may play a pivotal role in the limitation of secondary damage and/or the acceleration of restorative processes following injury to the vertebrate brain.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Aromatase', 'Brain Injuries', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fadrozole', 'Male', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Songbirds', 'Wounds, Penetrating']",15271060,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D08.244.453.489.500', 'D08.244.453.915.099', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.447.500', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.915.099', 'D12.776.422.220.453.489.500', 'D12.776.422.220.453.915.099'], ['C10.228.140.199', 'C10.900.300.087', 'C26.915.300.200'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['D02.626.400', 'D03.383.129.308.270'], ['A08.637', 'A11.650'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.620.750'], ['C26.986']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
21727,HIV-induced abnormalities in myelopoiesis and their recovery following antiretroviral therapy.,"HIV-1 infection is associated with hematologic abnormalities including defective myelopoiesis. Most studies of myelopoiesis during HIV-1 infection were performed using unfractionated bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, thus resulting in significant inter-individual variability in the numbers of cultured precursors. Here we evaluated the myelopoietic potential of circulating CD34+ progenitors by conducting a longitudinal analysis of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-induced changes of colony forming units-granulocyte and monocyte (CFU-GM) growth. Twelve HIV-infected individuals were studied longitudinally before and after initiation of ART (i.e. at a time when plasma HIV-RNA levels had become undetectable); thirty-one HIV-uninfected healthy individuals were enrolled as controls. Peripheral blood-derived CD34+ progenitors were purified by immunomagnetic sorting, and cultured in methylcellulose-based medium containing stem cell factor, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3. ART-induced changes in the proportion of CD8+ T cells expressing surface HLA-DR were also evaluated. We found that CFU-GM levels were increased in untreated HIV-infected individuals when compared to uninfected controls but declined significantly following ART, in parallel with the decline of HIV-RNA levels in plasma and with the down-regulation of HLA-DR expression on CD8+ T cells. These findings suggest that, in untreated HIV-infected individuals, chronic inflammation and/or immune activation is associated with defective myelopoiesis and accumulation of myeloid precursors. ART-induced suppression of HIV-1 replication is associated with normalization of CFU-GM levels.","['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'Granulocytes', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells', 'Stem Cells']",20353391,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D23.050.301.264.035.134', 'D23.101.100.110.134'], ['E02.319.310.075'], ['A11.251'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['A11.118.637.415', 'A11.148.350', 'A11.627.340', 'A15.145.229.637.415', 'A15.378.316.340', 'A15.382.490.315'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B04.820.650.589.650.350.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A11.118.637.555.652', 'A11.148.580', 'A11.627.624', 'A11.733.547', 'A15.145.229.637.555.652', 'A15.378.316.580', 'A15.382.490.555.652', 'A15.382.670.547', 'A15.382.680.547'], ['A11.148.378.590', 'A11.627.635', 'A11.872.378.590', 'A15.378.316.378.590'], ['A11.872']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
40390,Up-regulated HMGB1 in EAM directly led to collagen deposition by a PKCâ/Erk1/2-dependent pathway: cardiac fibroblast/myofibroblast might be another source of HMGB1.,"High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an important inflammatory mediator, is actively secreted by immune cells and some non-immune cells or passively released by necrotic cells. HMGB1 has been implicated in many inflammatory diseases. Our previous published data demonstrated that HMGB1 was up-regulated in heart tissue or serum in experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM); HMGB1 blockade could ameliorate cardiac fibrosis at the last stage of EAM. And yet, until now, no data directly showed that HMGB1 was associated with cardiac fibrosis. Therefore, the aims of the present work were to assess whether (1) up-regulated HMGB1 could directly lead to cardiac fibrosis in EAM; (2) cardiac fibroblast/myofibroblasts could secrete HMGB1 as another source of high-level HMGB1 in EAM; and (3) HMGB1 blockade could effectively prevent cardiac fibrosis at the last stage of EAM. Our results clearly demonstrated that HMGB1 could directly lead to cardiac collagen deposition, which was associated with PKCâ/Erk1/2 signalling pathway; furthermore, cardiac fibroblast/myofibroblasts could actively secrete HMGB1 under external stress; and HMGB1 secreted by cardiac fibroblasts/myofibroblasts led to cardiac fibrosis via PKCâ activation by autocrine means; HMGB1 blockade could efficiently ameliorate cardiac fibrosis in EAM mice.","['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases', 'Fibrillar Collagens', 'HMGB1 Protein', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myocarditis', 'Myofibroblasts', 'Osteopontin', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Up-Regulation']",24912759,"[['B01.050'], ['C20.111'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.249', 'D12.644.360.450.169', 'D12.776.476.450.169'], ['D05.750.078.280.300', 'D12.776.860.300.250.300'], ['D12.776.260.356.300', 'D12.776.660.235.400.600.300', 'D12.776.664.235.400.600.300'], ['G02.111.820.560', 'G03.493.560', 'G04.835.560'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['C14.280.238.625'], ['A11.329.228.975', 'A11.620.520.500'], ['D12.644.276.374.625', 'D12.776.395.700.837', 'D12.776.467.374.625', 'D12.776.860.300.762', 'D23.529.374.625'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725.049'], ['G02.111.905', 'G05.308.850', 'G07.690.773.998']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
43209,Septuagenarians and Older Patients are at a Higher Risk of Mortality with Adrenal Metastasectomy: An Analysis of the HCUP-NIS Database From 1992 to 2011.,"INTRODUCTION: Small institutional studies have shown that adrenalectomy to remove solitary metastases to the adrenal gland is safe and can improve overall survival for selective primary tumors. However, outcomes of adrenal metastasectomy have not been evaluated using large, national databases.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of adrenal metastasectomies from 1992 to 2011 were identified in the HCUP-NIS database. The primary endpoint analyzed was death during the same hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS), blood loss requiring transfusion, surgical infection, cardiac complications, and respiratory complications. A sub-analysis of 428 patients stratified by primary tumor (where data were available) was also performed. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square, ANOVA, and logistic regression using Stata software, significance was set at p value of 0.05.RESULTS: A total of 2,057 cases of adrenal metastasectomies were identified. Median age of the patients was 62 ± 13.2 years (49.9 % men, 69.7 % Caucasian). Over the study period, there was a general increase in the number of cases performed and the number performed by minimally invasive approaches. There was also a decrease in LOS and number of deaths. However, age ?71 years predicted a significantly higher rate of mortality (OR = 6.0, CI 1.3-26.5) when controlled for race, procedure type, year of surgery, and primary tumor in multivariable analysis. This age group had a higher number of cardiac complications (5.4 %, p = 0.005) that potentially contributed to the higher mortality rate. In addition, there was no difference in surgical outcomes when stratified by primary tumor type for the entire cohort of patients.CONCLUSION: Adrenal metastasectomy is a safe procedure with decreasing same-hospitalization mortality from 1992 to 2011. However, age ?71 years is a significant risk factor for same-hospitalization mortality. This increased risk should be considered when discussing adrenal metastasectomy in this age population.","['Adrenal Gland Neoplasms', 'Adrenalectomy', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Metastasectomy', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors']",27142624,"[['C04.588.322.078', 'C19.053.347', 'C19.344.078'], ['E04.270.115'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.400', 'N01.224.935.698.400', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.400', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['E04.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

43828,Biophysical studies of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus.,"The molecular weight of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) has been determined by analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering. The sedimentation coefficient of the virus was found to be 435S. The average value for molecular weight is (55 +/- 7) x 106. The virus genome consists of two segments of double-stranded RNA (molecular weights, 2.5 x 106 and 2.3 x 106), which represents 8.7% of the virion mass. The capsid protein moiety of IPNV consists of four species of polypeptides, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The number of molecules of each polypeptide in the virion has been determined. There are 22 molecules of the internal polypeptide alpha (molecular weight, 90,000), 544 molecules of the outer capsid polypeptide beta (molecular weight, 57,000), and 550 and 122 molecules, respectively, of the internal polypeptides gamma1 (molecular weight, 29,000) and gamma2 (molecular weight, 27,000). IPNV top component contains only the beta polypeptide species, and its molecular weight is estimated to be 31 x 106. The hydrodynamic diameter and electron microscopic diameter (calculated by catalase crystal-calibrated electron microscopy) of IPNV was compared with those of reovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus. Due to the swelling of the outer capsid, reovirus particles were found to be much larger when hydrated (96-nm diameter) than when dehydrated (76-nm diameter), having a large water content content and low average density. In contrast, IPNV particles are more rigid, having nearly the same average diameter under hydrous (64 nm) as under anhydrous conditions (59.3 nm). Encephalomyocarditis virus has a very low water content and does not shrink at all when prepared for electron microscopy.","['Animals', 'Capsid', 'Cell Line', 'Cyprinidae', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptides', 'RNA, Viral', 'Reoviridae', 'Salmonidae', 'Trout', 'Viral Proteins', 'Water']",558343,"[['B01.050'], ['A21.249.500.250'], ['A11.251.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.200.244'], ['G02.494'], ['D12.644'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['B04.820.223.719'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.817.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.817.750.825'], ['D12.776.964'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
11046,Are ethnic inequalities in 30-day ischaemic stroke survival emerging as treatment becomes more effective?,"AIM: Studies of ethnic differences in stroke survival have produced inconsistent findings. As treatment becomes more effective, inequalities may increase. We examine time trends in ischaemic stroke case fatality in New Zealand.METHOD: The 30-day case fatality rate (CFR) of ischaemic stroke in New Zealand was calculated from routinely collected data for two 5-year periods (2000-2004 and 2010-2014) in M?ori, Pacific, Asian and European people. A Poisson regression model tested ethnic inequalities between Europeans and people of other ethnicities in each time period.RESULTS: From 2000-2004 to 2010-2014, the age-sex standardised CFR in Europeans fell from 13.4% (95% CI 13.0 to 13.9%) to 10.7% (10.3 to 11.1%). In Pacific and Asian people, the CFR rose between the two periods, and in M?ori there was a drop from 18.2% to 16.2%; neither of these differences were statistically significant. After controlling for socio-demographic variables, service factors and comorbidities, the CFR was higher for M?ori than Europeans in 2000-2004, and for all ethnic groups compared with Europeans in 2010-2014. CFR ethnic inequality rose over that time-the change being statistically significant for Pacific (p=0.033) and Asian (p=0.010), and of borderline significance for M?ori (p=0.053).CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic inequalities in 30-day ischaemic stroke survival have increased significantly in the last 10 years. This may be due to differences in severity at presentation, or in access and utilisation of the increasingly effective acute and hyper-acute stroke interventions.","['Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Datasets as Topic', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'New Zealand', 'Oceanic Ancestry Group', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Stroke']",27362594,"[['M01.686.508.200'], ['E05.318.308.056', 'L01.313.500.750.300.188.400.500', 'L01.399.250.224', 'L01.470.750.750.431', 'N05.715.360.300.224', 'N06.850.520.308.056'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.639.760.747', 'Z01.678.100.747'], ['M01.686.508.600'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
18693,Transformation by complementation of a uracil auxotroph of the hyper lignin-degrading basidiomycete Phanerochaete sordida YK-624.,"Phanerochaete sordida YK-624 is a hyper lignin-degrading basidiomycete possessing greater ligninolytic selectivity than either P. chrysosporium or Trametes versicolor. To construct a gene transformation system for P. sordida YK-624, uracil auxotrophic mutants were generated using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and 5-fluoroorotate resistance as a selection scheme. An uracil auxotrophic strain (UV-64) was transformed into a uracil prototroph using the marker plasmid pPsURA5 containing the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase gene from P. sordida YK-624. This system generated approximately 50 stable transformants using 2 x 10(7) protoplasts. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the transformed pPsURA5 was ectopically integrated into the chromosomal DNA of all transformants. The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was also introduced into UV-64. The transformed EGFP was expressed in the co-transformants driven by P. sordida glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter and terminator regions.","['Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Industrial Microbiology', 'Lignin', 'Mutation', 'Orotate Phosphoribosyltransferase', 'Orotic Acid', 'Phanerochaete', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Uracil']",17701036,"[['G05.308.330'], ['E05.393.281.526'], ['D08.811.682.657.163.750'], ['D12.776.532.265'], ['H01.158.273.540.460', 'J01.897.120.460'], ['D05.750.078.562.180.515', 'D05.750.078.687', 'D20.538', 'D25.720.099.687', 'J01.637.051.720.099.687'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.700'], ['D03.066.627', 'D03.383.742.698.875.660'], ['B01.300.179.120.570'], ['G05.728.865'], ['D03.383.742.698.875']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
48985,Assessing mobility difficulties for cross-national comparisons: results from the World Health Organization Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the correspondence between self-reported and measured indicators of mobility disability in older adults in six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE).SETTING: Household surveys in China, India, Russia, South Africa, Ghana, and Mexico.PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling SAGE respondents aged 65 and older (N = 12,215).MEASUREMENTS: Objective mobility was assessed according to a 4-m timed walk at normal pace conducted in the respondent's home; slow walking speed was defined according to the Fried frailty criteria (lowest quintile of walking speed, adjusted for age and height). Self-reported mobility difficulty was assessed according to a question about ability to walk 1 km; this response was dichotomized into any versus no self-reported difficulty walking 1 km (reference no difficulty). The age- (5-year groups) and sex-specific probability of self-reporting difficulty walking 1 km was estimated in those with a measured slow walk using logistic regression.RESULTS: Between 42% and 76% of people aged 65 and older reported any difficulty walking 1 km. Average walking speed was slowest in Russia (0.61 m/s) and fastest in China (0.88 m/s). The probabilities of reporting any difficulty walking 1 km in women aged 65 to 69, for example, with a slow walk varied (China = 0.35, India = 0.90, Russia = 0.68, South Africa = 0.81, Ghana = 0.91, Mexico = 0.73; test of country differences P < .001). There was significant variation at older ages, albeit smaller in magnitude. Patterns were similar for men.CONCLUSION: Although correspondence between an objective and self-reported measure of mobility was generally high, correspondence differed significantly between LMICs. International comparisons of self-reported disability measures for clinical, prevention, and policy guidelines in LMICs should consider that self-reported data may not correspond to objective measures uniformly between countries.","['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Disabled Persons', 'Female', 'Global Health', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mobility Limitation', 'Population Surveillance', 'Risk Factors', 'Walking', 'World Health Organization']",24438515,"[['E02.760.169.063.500.067', 'E02.831.067', 'I03.050', 'N02.421.784.110'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['E01.370.400'], ['M01.150'], ['H02.403.371', 'N01.400.337'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.550'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['G11.427.410.568.900', 'G11.427.410.698.277.937', 'I03.350.937', 'I03.450.642.845.940'], ['N03.540.514.718.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

It encoded a polypeptide of 166 amino acid residues, including 19 residues of the signal sequence and 147 residues of the complete mature sequence of PLIalpha. The PLIalpha cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pET-16b and used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The recombinant PLIalpha expressed as a fusion protein was solubilized and purified to homogeneity by use of a metal affinity resin. The purified PLIalpha fusion protein underwent folding to form a trimeric structure like the intact PLIalpha, and showed inhibitory activity against the group II acidic PLA(2) from A. blomhoffii siniticus venom; although its binding constant (1/K(i)) value was 30-fold lower than that of the natural PLIalpha. The elimination of the N-terminal additional peptide from the fusion protein resulted in a marked increase in the inhibition activity with a binding constant comparable to that of the natural PLIalpha against the acidic PLA(2). Furthermore, the carbohydrate chains of the natural PLIalpha were found to play an important role in the inhibitory activity against the basic PLA(2).","['Agkistrodon', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Library', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors', 'Phospholipases A', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",10526227,"[['B01.050.150.900.833.672.125.937.240.250'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D12.776.124'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['G05.360.325'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D27.505.519.389.735'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.680.750'], ['E05.393.620.500.725']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
49821,Prognostic role of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in patients with bone metastases.,"BACKGROUND: Skeletal metastases are a common problem in patients with cancer, and surgical decision making depends on multiple factors including life expectancy. Identification of new prognostic factors can improve survival estimation and guide healthcare providers in surgical decision making. In this study, we aim to determine the prognostic value of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in patients with bone metastasis.METHODS: One thousand and twelve patients from two tertiary referral centers between 2002 and 2014 met the inclusion criteria. Bivariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the association of NLR and PLR with survival.RESULTS: At 3 months, 84.0% of the patients with low NLR were alive versus 61.3% of the patients with a high NLR (p < 0.001), and 75.8% of the patients with a low PLR were alive versus 55.6% of the patients with a high PLR (p < 0.001). Both elevated NLR and elevated PLR were independently associated with worse survival (hazard ratio (HR): 1.311; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.117-1.538; p = 0.001) and (HR: 1.358; 95% CI: 1.152-1.601; p < 0.001), respectively.CONCLUSION: This study showed both NLR and PLR to be independently associated with survival in patients who were treated for skeletal metastasis.","['Aged', 'Bone Neoplasms', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",30116026,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.149', 'C05.116.231'], ['E01.789.800.190', 'E05.318.740.998.300', 'N04.761.559.590.800.190', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.190', 'N05.715.360.750.795.300', 'N06.850.520.830.998.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595.500', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595.500', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595.500', 'E05.200.625.107.595.500', 'E05.242.195.107.595.500', 'G04.140.107.595.500', 'G09.188.105.595.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.740', 'E01.370.225.625.107.700', 'E01.370.225.625.625.625', 'E05.200.500.195.107.740', 'E05.200.625.107.700', 'E05.200.625.625.625', 'E05.242.195.107.740', 'G04.140.107.740', 'G09.188.105.700'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['N02.278.421.830']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
36322,Accurate preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas with C-11 methionine PET/CT.,"BACKGROUND: Focused unilateral or minimally invasive parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) depends on the successful preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the accuracy of C-11 methionine positron emission tomography/computed tomography (Met-PET/CT), a novel localization procedure for hyperfunctional parathyroid tissue.METHODS: Preoperative Met-PET/CT scans of the neck and mediastinum of 102 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for pHPT were preoperatively evaluated by a radiologist and a nuclear medicine physician and prospectively documented. The results of Met-PET/CT were compared with intraoperative and histopathological findings.RESULTS: pHPT was caused by a single-gland adenoma in 97 patients, whereas 5 patients had multiglandular disease. Met-PET/CT correctly located a single-gland adenoma in 83 of 97 (86%) patients with pHPT (sensitivity 91%). The positive predictive value of Met-PET/CT in localizing a single-gland adenoma was 93%. Of the 5 patients with multiglandular disease, Met-PET/CT identified 2 hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands in 1 patient, 1 gland in 3 individuals, and was negative in the fifth patient (sensitivity 80%). A highly significant correlation was observed between true-positive findings and the size (mean = 1.81 ± 0.84 cm) and weight (mean = 1.50 ± 2.56 g) of parathyroid adenoma, whereas patients with false-negative findings had significantly smaller (mean = 1.09 ± 0.41 cm) and lighter (mean = 0.37 ± 0.29 g) glands (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the high accuracy of Met-PET/CT in the preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas in a large series of patients with pHPT.","['Adenoma', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iohexol', 'Male', 'Methionine', 'Middle Aged', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Parathyroid Neoplasms', 'Parathyroidectomy', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",23478517,"[['C04.557.470.035'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.241.223.100.400.880.400', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.375.880.400'], ['D02.886.030.676', 'D12.125.142.557', 'D12.125.154.549', 'D12.125.166.676'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.567'], ['C04.588.322.525', 'C04.588.443.680', 'C19.344.525', 'C19.642.713'], ['E04.270.694'], ['E01.370.350.350.800.700', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800.399', 'E01.370.350.710.800.399', 'E01.370.350.825.800.399', 'E01.370.384.730.800.399'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Participants were or were not exposed to a serial reaction time task (SRTT) with two types of pseudo-random materials. Afterwards, participants worked on a free or cued generation task under inclusion and exclusion instructions. Results showed that pre-experimental response tendencies, non-associative learning of location frequencies, and the usage of cue locations introduced bias to PD estimates.

15374,Maternal Perception of Adequacy of Mother's Milk Among Mothers Giving Birth at a Teaching Hospital in Sri Lanka.,"BACKGROUND:: Sri Lanka boasts high rates of early and exclusive breastfeeding. Perceived inadequacy of milk, a global problem, is the main cause for early cessation of breastfeeding.RESEARCH AIMS:: The aims of this study are to (a) determine the prevalence, (b) identify the risk factors, and (c) ascertain the association that maternal psychological distress has with perceived inadequacy of milk (PIM), among mothers during the early postpartum period. Identifying and addressing modifiable risk factors for PIM may improve mothers' satisfaction with breastfeeding.METHODS:: A cross-sectional descriptive study of mothers ( n = 249) during the first week after birth was conducted at Colombo North Teaching Hospital (Ragama, Sri Lanka) from May 1, 2016, to June 10, 2016. Participants were recruited when the infant was more than 24 hours but less than 7 days old. A self-administered questionnaire, including the six-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, was used.RESULTS:: The majority of mothers (78%) perceived their milk quantity to be adequate. A family member telling mothers that their milk supply was low had the most significant associations with perceived inadequacy.

19477,"Capsaicin, a component of red peppers, stimulates protein kinase CKII activity.","Protein kinase CKII (CKII), a heterotetramer composed of two catalytic (alpha or alpha') subunits and two regulatory (beta) subunits, plays a critical role in cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis. Recently, capsaicin was shown to trigger apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the effect of capsaicin on CKII activity. Although capsaicin induced apoptotic death in HeLa cells, CKII activity was increased in the cytosolic fraction of HeLa cells after treatment. Capsaicin did not change the expression of the CKIIalpha and CKIIbeta proteins. Capsaicin stimulated the catalytic activity of recombinant CKII tetramer, but not the CKIIalpha subunit. Moreover, capsaicin enhanced the autophosphorylation of CKIIalpha and CKIIbeta. Taken together, our data suggest that capsaicin stimulates the phosphotransferase activity of CKII holoenzyme by interacting with the CKIIbeta subunit.","['Capsaicin', 'Capsicum', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Protein Subunits']",20510015,"[['D02.065.690.500', 'D02.455.326.271.690.222', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.099', 'D03.132.760.200', 'D10.251.355.325.190'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.908.500.145'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.140.600', 'D12.776.476.150.600'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.570', 'G02.466'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.115.690'], ['D12.776.813']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33139,Glucose intolerance develops prior to increased adiposity and accelerated cessation of estrous cyclicity in female growth-restricted rats.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of metabolic disease increases in early menopause. Low birth weight influences the age at menopause. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that intrauterine growth restriction programs early reproductive aging and impaired glucose homeostasis in female rats.METHODS: Estrous cyclicity, body composition, and glucose homeostasis were determined in female control and growth-restricted rats at 6 and 12 mo of age; sex steroids at 12 mo.RESULTS: Glucose intolerance was present at 6 mo of age prior to cessation of estrous cyclicity and increased adiposity in female growth-restricted rats. However, female growth-restricted rats exhibited persistent estrus and a significant increase in adiposity, fasting glucose, and testosterone at 12 mo of age (P < 0.05). Insulin release in response to a glucose challenge was blunted in conjunction with a reduction in protein expression of pancreatic glucose transporter type 2 and estrogen receptor-á at 12 mo of age in female growth-restricted rats (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that slow fetal growth programmed glucose intolerance that developed prior to early estrous acyclicity; yet, fasting glucose levels were elevated in conjunction with increased adiposity, accelerated cessation of estrous cyclicity and a shift toward testosterone excess at 12 mo of age in female growth-restricted rats.","['Adiposity', 'Animals', 'Body Composition', 'Estrus', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Intolerance', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Homeostasis', 'Menopause', 'Organ Size', 'Rats', 'Testosterone', 'Time Factors', 'Uterus']",26854801,"[['E01.370.600.115.100.062.500', 'G02.111.130.134.500', 'G03.180.134.500', 'G07.100.049.134.500'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.130', 'G03.180', 'G07.100.049'], ['G08.686.195.500'], ['C13.703.277.370', 'C16.300.390', 'C23.550.393.450'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['C18.452.394.952.500'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.355', 'E01.370.374.355', 'E05.200.124.100.355'], ['G07.410'], ['G08.686.157.500', 'G08.686.841.249.500'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.660', 'E05.041.124.715', 'G07.100.100.660', 'G07.345.249.690'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D04.210.500.054.079.429.824', 'D06.472.334.851.968.984'], ['G01.910.857'], ['A05.360.319.679']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

9714,Balloon embolectomy catheters in small arteries. III. Surgical significance of eccentric balloons.,"Some embolectomy balloons distend eccentrically. This study was undertaken to compare balloon eccentricity in air with that which occurs in arteries, to determine the influence of balloon eccentricity on shear force, and to estimate the injury potential of eccentric balloons. We studied 21 Edwards and 17 Shiley catheters in 24 dog carotid arteries in vitro. Each vessel was mounted horizontally in a Krebs-Ringer bath with one end of the vessel suspended from a force gauge. Catheters were inserted through an arteriotomy, and balloons were distended to lateral wall pressures of 25, 75, and 125 mm Hg. X-ray studies were used to measure balloon eccentricity--that is, the ratio of larger radius (R) to smaller radius (r). Comparison revealed a high correlation (r = 0.88, P less than 0.05) between R/r values in air and R/r values within arteries. Shear forces were produced when balloons were withdrawn through arteries. Regression equations revealed that the shear force increased about 10% for each unit increase in R/r. However, extremely eccentric balloons (R/r 8:1) pushed the catheter shaft deep into the vessel wall, gouging a linear tear in the media. This was seen in vitro and in two dogs studied 2 and 14 days after embolectomy. We conclude that balloon eccentricity in air is an accurate indicator of balloon eccentricity within arteries, that moderately eccentric balloons (R/r 3:1) are acceptable for clinical use, but that extremely eccentric balloons (R/r greater than 3:1) may cause severe injury and should not be used in the operating room.","['Animals', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Injuries', 'Dogs', 'Embolism', 'Methods', 'Models, Biological', 'Postoperative Complications']",6829008,"[['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114.186'], ['C10.228.140.300.200.345', 'C10.228.140.300.350.500', 'C10.900.250.300', 'C14.907.253.123.345', 'C14.907.253.535.500', 'C26.915.200.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['C14.907.355.350'], ['E05.581'], ['E05.599.395'], ['C23.550.767']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
38215,Clinical aspects of the SR-IV Programmed Subjective Refractor.,"Five studies were performed on 682 eyes of currently working and retired factory workers and some of their children. The magnitude of the refractive error and the visual acuity obtained were essentially equivalent for the two methods (SR-IV, Phoroptor). SR-IV testing required less time than conventional techniques. Patients reported the SR-IV easy to use and they expressed confidence in the results. In a separate study, the amplitude of accommodation was measured. This measurement may prove useful in estimating the near addition.","['Accommodation, Ocular', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Refraction, Ocular', 'Refractive Errors']",7148974,"[['G14.010'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.406'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['H02.403.810.468'], ['H02.553'], ['E01.370.380.850.700', 'G01.590.775', 'G14.760'], ['C11.744']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
